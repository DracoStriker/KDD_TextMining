This whodunit story by Dame Agatha is excellent. She has always been myfavorite writer of detective fiction. I keep returning to the filmversion, however, not because of the story but because of the film'ssheer elegance and style. It is awash in elegance ... the majesticcinematography; the glamorous clothes; the delightfully eccentricaristocratic characters; the mysterious yet refined musical score. Thefilm is so theatrically regal I'm surprised that it did not feature arepresentative of British royalty.The setting is Europe in the 1930's. The pace is slow and relaxed. Andwhile the dialogue is in English, the film has a deliciouslyinternational flavor, with a mix of interesting accents and wordpronunciations. Heavy on dialogue, the film never seems overly talky,the result of a clever screenplay and lush visuals. Humor is includedin the script usually in the form of tasteful put-downs. Example: anattractive Mrs. Hubbard comments: "Don't you agree the man must haveentered my compartment to gain access to Mr. Ratchett?" The agingPrincess Dragomiroff responds in a deadpan tone: "I can think of noother reason, madam."In his portrayal of Hercule Poirot, Albert Finney almost literallydisappears into the role, a tribute to convincing makeup and toFinney's adroit acting. His performance is appropriately idiosyncratic,deliciously hammy, and theatrical, every bit as entertaining in thisfilm as Peter Ustinov is in subsequent Christie movies. The rest of thecast has ensemble parts, my favorite being Wendy Hiller whose PrincessDragomiroff comes across as royal, proud, and very eccentric.With its snowy landscapes, ornate and cozy interiors, and subduedlighting, "Murder On The Orient Express" is an excellent movie to watchon a cold, winter night, snuggled under a blanket or next to a warmfireplace with a cup of cappuccino or a glass of cognac. Just be surethat all knives and daggers in your mansion are out of reach from yourstaff of servants.
