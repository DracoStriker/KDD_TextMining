One of the most famous of Dame Agatha Christie's novels. This is aglorious, beautifully directed, star studded production. I will behonest and say it took me a long time to appreciate just how good afilm this actually is.The format and layout of the film works tremendously well, the dark andtwisted kidnap and killing story at the beginning sets the tone well,it hits hard, and makes the end of the film all the more engaging andbelievable.The film looks sensational, it is a beautiful production (especially inHD) the scenery throughout is lavish, a true feast for the eyes. Fromthe bright sunny beginning, to the dark, bleak and snowy scene of themurder. The film seems to get intentionally darker as it progresses.The costumes are glorious, Jacqueline Bisset especially gets to wearsome wonderful outfits.Albert Finney is good in the part, he certainly looks the part, when Iread the book he is exactly how I visualise him. He is wonderfullytheatrical, and as Ustinov definitely suits the flavour of Death on theNile, so does Finney here.The characterisations aside from Poirot are expertly brought to life,some glorious performances, Lauren Bacall and Wendy Hillier aresensational in their roles, how well the cast bring to life the classsystem of 1930, it really was a different world. Sir John Gielgud istremendous as stiff upper lipped Beddoes, and plaudits also to RichardWidmark who makes Mr Ratchett as vile as possible.9/10 you can almost smell the gourmet cooking and hear the clink ofChampagne flutes. A glorious film. Kenneth Branagh's new adaptation hasa lot to live up to.
