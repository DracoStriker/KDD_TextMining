The film is in fact based on the 1934 novel Murder on the OrientExpress by Agatha Christie. It is a wonderful film - I have never readthe book to compare to the movie - but I can say the film is worthwatching if you love a good mystery movie.An all-star, well seasoned, cast does help to make the film moreintriguing, more appealing because all gave outstanding performances inthis film. The story itself will easily pull you in even if you areunfamiliar with the cast - the story (mystery) is that good.If you like this movie then you may enjoy similar types of films like"Sleuth", "Deathtrap" or "Murder By Death".9/10
