If you want to introduce your children to the murder-mystery genrewithout scaring them or boring them, then show them this terrific film,which made instant Poirot fans of my 10 and 13 year-old kids. AlbertFinney is so over-the-top that he towers over an excellent ensemblecast, and his performance became the standard that I'm sure DavidSuchet aspired to for many years. The opening sequence, showing theback-story of the 'Baby Armstrong' case, is very creepy and engages theviewer immediately. The sets and costumes (and even the openingcredits) remind one of the grand Hollywood spectacles of the past.Sidney Lumet's direction is outstanding, as are the performancesthroughout. Definitely worth an annual viewing.
