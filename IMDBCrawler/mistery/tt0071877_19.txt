Great fun! The undeniably best version of any Agatha Christie novel andone of the most enjoyable films ever made. Incredible group of starsperfectly cast down to the smallest part. Ingrid Bergman won the Oscarand she is fine but Betty Bacall is the real scene stealer here.Blustery and boorish she is the perfect portrait of the overbearingtourist you want to avoid. Vanessa Redgrave looking great is loose,saucy and well matched with Sean Connery, a shame they never costarredagain. Jacqueline Bisset, at the height of her beauty, gives a niceaccount of a high strung countess. Originally Marlene Dietrich wassought for the imperious Princess Dragomiroff and surely she would havebeen great but Wendy Hiller makes the part her own with a larger thanlife performance. Finney makes a terrific Poirot with an astonishingmakeup job. Speaking of which both the production and wardrobe designare sensational. Even though it is on the long side Lumet keeps ithumming along nicely with a musical score that sets the scene wellwithout overwhelming the flow of the picture. If you've never seen thisgem do so with haste.
