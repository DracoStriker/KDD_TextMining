I don't mind telling you that my head nearly exploded during theopening credits: Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, IngridBergman, Michael York, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, AnthonyPerkins, Martin Balsam, John Gielgud! Not to mention that 'Murder onthe Orient Express (1974)' was directed by Sidney Lumet, one of myfavourite filmmakers, and adapted from an Agatha Christie novel. It wasonly recently that I had my first encounter with noted Belgiandetective Hercule Poirot, having enjoyed a few television episodes withDavid Suchet in the title role. Finney's Poirot is perhaps too much ofa caricature, emphasising the cartoonish silliness of the characterrather than the quiet superiority found in Suchet's portrayal (however,I'm not familiar with Christie's novel, and perhaps he was simplywritten that way). Nevertheless, the remainder of the ensemble castprovides stellar support.Hercule Poirot is aboard a trans-European express train when a wealthyman (Widmark) is murdered in the neighbouring sleeping compartment.Poirot has a dozen suspicious suspects to choose from, and you'll neverpick who did it. Such a large supporting cast may have proved difficultto depict without placing undue emphasis on any one character (andperhaps two hours is insufficient time to thoroughly explore everyone'smotives), but Lumet does a good job of bringing together all the loosethreads. Red herrings are scattered from right to left, and only Poirothimself can discern the real evidence from the decoys. Ingrid Bergmanwon her third Oscar for her role as shy missionary Greta, and I do loveIngrid, but the highlight for me was Lauren Bacall's insufferablyloquacious Mrs Hubbard. For some high-class entertainment with someprestigious company, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is a surefirewinner.
