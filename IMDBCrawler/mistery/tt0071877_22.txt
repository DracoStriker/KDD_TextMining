"Murder On The Orient Express" is arguably the most famous theatricallyreleased film based on an Agatha Christie book, but there are twofactors that keep me from rating it quite as high as its successors,"Death On The Nile" and "Evil Under The Sun": a) Albert Finney has hismoments as Hercule Poirot, but sometimes his stuffy, manneredperformance comes close to obnoxiousness (some people might claim thathe's trying to be more accurate to the character as written byChristie, but I don't think the Poirot of the books would ever tear upthe menu of a restaurant and throw the pieces up in the air), b)although the solution to the mystery is one of Christie's most daringand unusual, it is also pretty tough to translate from the page to thescreen because it is necessary to introduce a remarkably high number ofcharacters and explain the connection of all their backgrounds to thepresent events. The script does not succeed 100% at this task, and someof Poirot's conclusions seem to come from pure supposition. Besides allthat, however, there's still a lot to like about "Murder On The OrientExpress": the superb cast (though I don't know why Ingrid Bergman wonan Oscar for this role, if anyone deserved such an award, it wasprobably John Gielgud or Wendy Hiller), the exhilarating music score,the nostalgic train setting, and some memorably atmospheric scenes (theopening, the re-construction of the crime, etc.). Definitely a filmthat can be watched multiple times. *** out of 4.
