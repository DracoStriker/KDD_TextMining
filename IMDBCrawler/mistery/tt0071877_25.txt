Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave, SeanConnery, Anthony Perkins and Michael York, to name a few, together in amovie. Director Sidney Lumet (from '12 Angry Men') has made a movie set in atrain where all these great actors have the same amount of screen time,accept for Finney who is in almost every scene.The movie is set on the Orient Express where a murder is committed. HerculePoirot (Finney) is assigned to solve this murder mystery, written by AgathaChristie. Since the murder is committed on the train every passenger is asuspect and with interrogations from Poirot we are able to think with him.Some of the characters are real suspects, others seem very innocent. It isall very interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat for a very longtime.It has an ending it deserves. Surprising for some, I guess, although thereare enough clues on the way. It is part of the fun with this movie. Itdoesn't cheat in a single way, it shares all the known information andtherefore we have the feeling we are detectives ourselves. A great story, agreat director, great actors (especially Finney and Bergman are terrific), agreat movie.
