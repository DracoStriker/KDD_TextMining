Just watched this flick yesterday. It's a rather under-looked piece ofcinema from director Sidney Lumet who absolutely does not disappointwith this feature. The film is a Hercule Poirot detective/AgathaChristie vehicle that works really well. The cast is incredible withthe like of Sean Connery, Michael York, Ingrid Bergman (who won anOscar for her role in this), Lauren Bacall, Martin Balsam, RichardWidmark, Anthony Perkins, and Albert Finney who does a fantastic job asPoirot himself. Overall the film is well executed and brilliantlywritten (thank you Agatha Christie!) I have found myself to really love Lumet's work. I don't give that manyperfect scores and three of his films have that from me (12 Angry Men,The Hill, Prince of The City). Lumet is just an incredible storytellereven if he's had a lot more misses than hits. 'Express' is no differentfrom his other work as it has an Oscar winning performance, greatediting, a wonderful score, and (the greatest Lumet trademark) a filmthat takes place mostly in one setting. A take my hat off to you, Mr. Lumet. A recommended film. 8/10
