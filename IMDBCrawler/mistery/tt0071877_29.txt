It's a shame the original journey is no longer available. They keepcutting the service. This is the best characterisation of Poirot I haveseen. He reminds me of Mr Creosote from The Meaning of Life. What a cast! I thought the old Princess showed how Gothic can be aneffective look even in old age. A formidable German maid for her. SeanConnery in tweeds. Michael York looking like Errol Flynn. Colin Blakelywas the Colm Meaney of the time.A great send-off in Istanbul or Stamboul, looking at suspicious fruit,and the great family of man. Poirot's many short conversations with the suspects are a valuableinsight into the tricks of psychology. Plenty of lines in the dialoguecould be useful in every day conversation.A real sense of the train, lots of cuts to noisy, steamy rattlings andthunderings. Nostalgia. Trains were better then.
