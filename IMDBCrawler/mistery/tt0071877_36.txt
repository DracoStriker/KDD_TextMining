This unforgettable film isn't only probably the best adaptation ever ofany of the magnificent novels of Agatha Christie (she herself approvedhighly of it, which she didn't e.g. of the "Miss Marple" films withMargaret Rutherford), but one of the greatest movies ever made. Ofcourse there is an all-star cast, but not just for the names' sake:every single one of the stars fits his role to a T (imagine that IngridBergman was originally to play Princess Dragomiroff, but she chose the"ungraceful" one of Miss Olsen - and won an Oscar for it!), from AlbertFinney of course as the original Hercule Poirot, literally as he wasdescribed by Agatha Christie (although he would have been at that time"too young" for the role, but an excellent make-up fixed that) toMartin Balsam as his eager friend and "assistant" who after everyinquiry asks hopefully: "Please - HE did it?!". Lauren Bacall, as the"Nemesis", the instigator of the revenge on the cruel child murdererportrayed by a dangerous-looking Richard Widmark, plays with great carea talkative American tourist - and is revealed in the end as the famousstage actress Linda Arden, for whom THIS was her most difficult role...Anthony Perkins is at his best, once more as a shy young man with amother complex, Jacqueline Bisset and Michael York are the elegant andsnobby young couple from diplomatic circles, Wendy Hiller (who was alsomuch younger than the make-up made her) is a Russian relic of theCzars' days, and Rachel Roberts her devoted maid who had obviously beenin love with her falsely accused colleague at the Armstrong house whohad committed suicide (in fact, her harsh German ways - although theactress obviously didn't speak German and was dubbed for a few lines -and her short, male haircut underline the suggestion of her being alesbian), as was the seemingly hard-boiled detective Dick Hardman, whobreaks down in tears in the end... John Gielgud plays the ultimateconceited British butler; and as for Sean Connery and Vanessa Redgrave,they make a magnificent and extremely beautiful secret couple! DenisQuilley as the temperamental Italian-American, Jean-Pierre Cassel asthe quiet conductor who was necessary for the completion of the plan(and who was in fact the dead maid's father), and George Coulouris asthe stoic Greek doctor complete a cast that is surely unequaled. SidneyLumet also took care of ALL the other big and small details: the tightsettings of the "prison-train" trapped in midst the snow just "stinks"with the atmosphere of the decadence of the "high society" between thetwo World Wars, the music further enhances both the suspense and theperiod-feeling, the dresses and the hairstyles are absolutelyauthentic... The dialogs switch between philosophy, politics, andhumor: and in the end, of course, the great Hercule Poirot reveals thetruth about the murder in self-justice - and lets the persons involvedget away with it, which deeply occupies not only HIS conscience, butalso the audience's. In short: "Murder on the Orient Express" isn'tjust a well-made, expensive, entertaining crime mystery - it's aClassic with ALL the required ingredients.
