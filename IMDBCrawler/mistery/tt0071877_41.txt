Murder on the Orient Express is an adaptation of Agatha Christie'sstory about a detective that unravels a murder on the Orient Express.The movie covers the moments before the train, the murder, and thediscovery of the culprit.Murder on the Orient Express is an excellent film for anyone lookingfor a murder mystery. It is well acted with characters that aredistinct and have motives. Much of the film takes place on the OrientExpress and the audience becomes familiar with the train's mannerisms.The directing and writing does an excellent job with portraying how themurder took place and Pierot's subsequent investigation.This film does have flows. The middle section of the film slowed to acrawl, as the red herrings sprung forth. The interviews with thepassengers became predictable. These flaws do not break the movie andthe actors and actresses do a great job to make these flaws lessnoticeable.I would recommend Murder on the Orient Express.
