Usually when I'm watching a murder mystery like this I'll have paperand pen ready to take notes of the characters as an aid in trying tofigure out who the culprit was. Turns out it was a moot exercise here,and if you haven't seen the picture I won't spoil it, but be preparedfor a novel surprise.As with a lot of these cable movie mainstays I delayed watching thepicture for the longest time and as happens in most cases, I shouldhave gotten around to it a lot sooner. All the performers are topnotch, and Albert Finney simply cracked me up as the Belgian detectiveHercule Poirot. I can't imagine all those physical and facialcontortions he had to put up with to interpret his character but it wasa sketch. Tough call between him and Art Carney for Best Actor ("Harryand Tonto") that year, it could have gone either way.With Ingrid Bergman, quite honestly I didn't even recognize her in therole of Greta Ohlssen. Perhaps that was part of the calculation inawarding her Best Supporting Actress, however I personally couldn't seeit. As for the rest, all bring something marvelous to theircharacterizations, with John Gielgud's Beddoes a close second to Finneyas my favorite in the film.All in all a wonderful murder mystery with very obvious overtones tothe famous Lindbergh Baby kidnapping case of the early Thirties. Theresolution forces some critical thinking on the part of the viewer asto Poirot and Bianchi's (Martin Balsam) recommendation to theauthorities. One thing bothers me though relative to murder victimRatchett/Casetti. Without giving away the ending but considering theresolution, why would Richard Widmark's character have been gettingdeath threats in the first place?
