This 1974 adaptation of Christie's 1934 works so well for threereasons. Sidney Lumet's superlative direction. A great bunch of actors both (at the time) old (Bacall, looking andacting great, Bergman) and new (Bisset, York, Redgrave).Last but not least the material itself. It's the last item that I think a lot of people overlook when theyconsider "Murder on the Orient Express" either as a film or as one ofChristie's stories. Without giving too much away, unlike a lot of herother material, "Murder on the Orient Express" deals with some realissues like revenge, mourning and finding the strength to move on aftera tragedy. What has always intrigued me the most was how well Christieand this film handle the more than obvious parallel to the Lindberghkidnapping and it is the fact that it plays the pivotal point in thestory is what gives it much more weight than any other of her stories.This film adaptation serves the material superbly from the amazingopening sequence that brilliantly summarizes the kidnapping to thegreat, almost celebratory closing scene. None of the adaptations ofChristie's films made after this one had this films impact.
