This movie is an adaptation of the famous Agatha Christie novel by thesame name and it surely lives up to it. Albert Finney as the littleBelgian detective, Hercule Poirot, gives one of his finestperformances. The element of suspense in the course of the film is comparable to thatof Hitchcock and the final realization of the truth just blows the mindaway. Poirot's "order and methods" are a treat to watch. The uniquelook, accent etc. match Christie's description of the fictionaldetective word by word. For Christie readers and Poirot fans, thismovie is 128 mins of pure pleasure. It is a must watch for all Christie fans as well as those who likecrime thrillers.
