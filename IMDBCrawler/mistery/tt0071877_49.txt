This adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel is absolutely wonderful.The story begins with reflections of the kidnapping and subsequentdeath of a child named Daisy Armstrong. As the story progresses welearn that there is a man on the Orient Express who is somehow relatedto the Armstrong case and asks for Poirot to be his bodyguard. I willnot disclose anymore details lest it spoil the story for you. Now,about this movie: First it has the difficult task of throwing you intothe time period and making you believe that it's actually 1934. Itaccomplishes that just fine. It also has the very difficult task ofmaking you love the characters. This film features an all-star cast,including Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins, Sean Connery,Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, and of course JohnGielgud. You can't find this much talent in Hollywood pictures anymore.Albert Finney is fantastic as Poirot. I don't read the books but hismannerisms, acting and habits are exactly how I might envision them tobe. I can't decide who is better as Poirot, Finney, Suchet, or Ustinov.To tell the truth they are all excellent as Poirot. Most important ofall though the movie actually manages to construct a very compellingmurder mystery that takes place on this train which is trapped becauseof a snow drift on the tracks. This plot point cranks up the tension aswhoever committed the murder has to stay on board the train or riskdying of hypothermia in the middle of the Balkans. Furthermore, theclimax and the finale is amazing, because there are some wonderful plottwists that are pulled off just beautifully. Murder on the orientexpress is quite possibly one of the best murder mysteries ever and sodevilishly clever that it will keep you guessing.
