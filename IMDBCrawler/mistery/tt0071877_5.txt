Sidney Lumet directs a great cast through a brilliant cinematicinterpretation of one of Agatha Christie's most popular Hercule PoirotMysteries. The train upon which the great investigator finds himself ishalted by an avalanche of snow in the Alps, and two horrible crimesseem to have intersected in the first class cabin. Despite the crampedquarters, the only witness is the murder victim himself, and Poirotmust put together the solution from disparate and seeminglycontradictory evidence.The three most striking qualities of this film are its productionvalues, cast, and Finney's exhausting performance. Although a littleover-the-top, Finney gets Poirot exactly right - Poirot is played as asomewhat obsessive, slightly manic, and flamboyant Belgian - not at allas a non-English Sherlock Holmes. The cast speaks for itself. Bacall,Perkins, Hiller, Redgrave, York and Bissett are all delightful in theirsupporting roles. But perhaps the most under-recognized achievement ofthis film is its cinematography. The film is extremely visuallyengaging from start to finish. This is achieved by perfect visualpacing, great camera work, spectacular - though somewhat cramped andredundant - sets, good costuming, and a stunningly attractive cast.Murder on the Orient Express also succeeds in sticking with Christie'soriginal narrative (mostly), and sets a high standard for film versionsof the great mystery writers repertoire. From my perspective, the filmremains unequaled among the Poirot interpretations and meets thechallenge of adapting and simplifying Christie's often complexexposition very nicely.
