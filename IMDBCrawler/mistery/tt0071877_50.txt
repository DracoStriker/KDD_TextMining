This is one of the most faithfully adapted of Christie's works andcoincidentally one of the very best. The enclosed almost suffocatingnature of the passengers stranded on the train is brilliantly shot asare Poirot's evolving hypothesis', I loved this. The ending is amassive and wonderful shock, the back story brilliantly done in a'newspaper-ish' way. Albert Finney is the best he has ever been andBacall and Bergman are my two favourite ladies, they and in fact thewhole cast are wonderful, the characters are brought to life with animmense vitality.The train pulling away from the station to the swelling music isgenius, it sweeps the view up and along the journey with it and conveysan amazing sense of majesty.Definitely watch this, one of Christie's best books, the best adaption.Marvellous.
