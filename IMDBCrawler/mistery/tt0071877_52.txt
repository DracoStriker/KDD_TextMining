I have just watched this movie again, having seen it several timesbefore. It remains a great production with wonderful performances fromall involved and, despite obviously knowing the outcome, I still findit to be a fascinating story. This time, however, something else wasadded. For no obvious reason, on this particular viewing, I foundmyself imbuing each character with more depth than previously. Perhapsthis is because I already remembered, more or less, the relationship ofeach character with the family and the impact the initial crime had hadon each of them. I'm a self-confessed film buff and an aficionado ofpretty much every film genre, but I suspect that, in my later years,I'm leaning more towards character driven stories, of which this is onof the greats. It's a movie I can happily watch every year or so.
