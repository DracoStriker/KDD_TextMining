When a friend first told me that Albert Finney was playing Poirot in the1974 version of "Orient Express" that I was watching on AMC, I did notbelieve him.  Even after I saw the credits, I could scarcely believe it.Finney's handling of the role was nearly perfect; only David Suchet hadbeenas an effective Poirot.  Besides Finney, the movie includes some of thegreatest performances by some of the greatest actors.  Lauren Bacall,SeanConnery, Sir John Gielgud are all fantastic in their roles.  IngridBergman's performance was truly deserving of an Oscar.  This is, by far,thebast treatment of an Agatha Christie story.
