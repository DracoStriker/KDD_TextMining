Decent mystery plot, intelligent but not intense flow of the story.Story revolves around the murder motives, but personally I feel not allmotives were strong enough to carry out the murder, like the chauffeur.And how the detective knows all the character's background is also amystery that wasn't solved.Like sherlock holmes used to keep a journalfor all the crime happened in past with details. But how this detectiveremembers that god knows. Most of the charterer's played well deservedrole, specially detective poirot. Ending is a twist and I liked that. Anice movie to watch who loves classic mystery films.
