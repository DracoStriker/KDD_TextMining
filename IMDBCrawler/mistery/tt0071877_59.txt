The majesty of this movie overcomes any slow spots from a fine moviedirected by Sidney Lumet. The music score was impressive for sure, andso was spotting the famous stars as they appear in cameos. All creditto the casting director for bringing together Lauren Bacall, IngridBergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Sean "James Bond"Connery, John "Caligula" Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony "Psycho II"Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Rachel "Picnic at Hanging Rock" Roberts,Michael York. Huge stars then and now.I know Kenneth Branagh is directing a remake due for release in 2017,and maybe there can be another radical reboot featuring say BritneySpears, Daniel Radcliffe, Dustin Diamond (in his comeback), Vin Diesel,Jeffrey Ho, Todd Bridges (another comeback).
