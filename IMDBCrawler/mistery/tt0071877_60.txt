Great, star-studded adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie novel.It is 1934 and master-detective Hercule Poirot is travelling fromIstanbul to France on the Orient Express. On the first night the man inthe next compartment is murdered. Once he starts investigating, Poirotfaces a barrage of conflicting clues and potential motives.A great whodunnit, one of the best. The murderer is not at all obvious.As you go deeper and deeper into the movie, the plot gets thicker andthicker, but without any clear guilty party emerging. Great, unforeseentwist at the end. Fantastic story-writing by Agatha Christie, welltranslated to screen by director Sydney Lumet and his cast and crew.On the subject of cast, it is quite amazing - certainly one of the moststar-studded every assembled for a movie. Just about every name is anicon of the silver screen - Albert Finney (as Poirot), Lauren Bacall,Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Michael York, JacquelineBisset, Martin Balsam, Anthony Perkins, Richard Widmark.None of them put a foot wrong,Ingrid Bergman got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance,but I'm not sure why. While she puts in a solid performance, she hardlystood out from the rest.Albert Finney got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance,though I think his makeup artist deserved it more - he wasunrecognisable while playing Poirot.
