I had read many of Agatha Christie's works before seeing this movie,but I had not read this story. I kept myself away from the story untilI had seen this movie. I was disappointed by the change made to the endof the "Then There Were None" movie adaption, but I have wonderedwhether it was because I had read the book first. So, I started thismovie without knowledge of the plot. I only knew that Poirot would bein it and someone was to be murdered.The one thing I admire most about old movies is the scenery and cultureincluded in their sets, and this movie certainly has these qualities.The lack of distracting sounds or music during moments of dialogue werevery pleasant. The actors were wonderful in their roles and their quipsin conversation were amusing indeed.In the end, it is a long movie which could try the patience of many andis certainly a movie that will send one to sleep late at night. It isnot very exciting and there is little action. But for those who enjoywatching good acting and a good mystery, this is a movie to watch. Iprobably will not watch it again, for the mystery is gone the secondtime around, but I feel that I did not waste my time with this movie.
