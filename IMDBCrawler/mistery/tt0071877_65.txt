Agatha Christie's marvelous tale of who did it again provides for awonderful 1974 film. Surprisingly, Ingrid Bergman, as a timid missionary, won the bestsupporting actress Oscar. Bergman gave far better performances andshould not have won here. Even in her acceptance speech, she remindedthe Academy of Valentina Cortese's performance in "Day for Night" asthe actress who forgets her lines during filming.Albert Finney has a field day in acting. As the inspector, he issuspicious of everyone and everything. He really acts like an inspectorthough at times it was difficult to understand him in a contrivedFrench accent.The film is helped by a tremendous all-star cast. With the exception ofFinney, no one really dominates here as we come to realize why RichardWidmark deserved to be done in by all.
