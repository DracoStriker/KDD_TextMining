The heading is so true in the case of Agatha Christie. Here we have atypically baffling murder mystery, the old-fashioned kind set aboard anexotic train setting where a number of suspects are available for thefinal round-up by detective Hercule Poirot (ALBERT FINNEY).We've seen plenty of train murder cases before, but this one has anextra special passenger list of exceptional well-known star talent:LAUREN BACALL, JACQUELINE BISSET, SEAN CONNERY, JOHN GIELGUD, WENDYHILLER and VANESSA REDGRAVE are all rather first-class snobs, andMARTIN BALSAM, INGRID BERGMAN and ANTHONY PERKINS are members of thelower class.Naturally, they all become prime suspects when a murder is committedand they all have their moments to shine. Bacall is convincing as apushy American, Bisset and Hiller are members of royalty, Connery is astuffy colonel, and Gielgud deals rather brusquely with his secretary,Perkins. Ingrid Bergman won a Supporting Role Oscar for her role as adowdy, rather retarded woman who is supposed to be a Swedish maid.The denouement is a surprising one, and not the kind anyone in theirright mind is likely to suspect. The only drawback for me was thatAlbert Finney's Piorot seemed too theatrical, not quite as convincingas others in the role. Perhaps the make-up job was not the best. Nordid I think Bergman's role was really Oscar material. (Neither did she.She seemed rather apologetic at the Oscars that year, thanking all ofthe other ladies for their great work).Well worth seeing, a fascinating example of how suitable AgathaChristie's material is for the screen, especially when kept in the sametime period as the original story--in this case, the '30s, where theauthentic period costumes add to the proper atmosphere of the work.
