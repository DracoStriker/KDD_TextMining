This is by far one of the best Mystery movies there is, I just loved thismovie. the stars were incredible, just to name a few, Lauren Becall wasfantastic as the loud, sarcastic and funny widow. Albert Finney whom Ifelthad to much make up on was very amusing in investigating each person onthetrain. Martin Balsam who thought everyone did it at one point of time wasalso funny and amusing.Ingrid Bergman whom I did not recognize right off,did a splendid performance as the African Missionary. I am very glad thatthis movie still exist and is not in the preservation vault.
