With the action taking place almost entirely on a train, The OrientExpress,this Agatha Christie novel works well on film.  The cast is loaded withbignames, and they earn their pay, as the murder mystery moves along to agreatclimax.  Albert Finney is a better Poirot than Peter Ustinov in "Death onthe Nile."  As always, the Poirot character is full of himself, sort ofirritating, at least to me.  But that's part of it.  A must see for thosewho like whodunits.
