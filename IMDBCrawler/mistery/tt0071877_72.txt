This is one of the first videos I bought, and I'vewatched it ...oh, I don't know...about 20 times or so. I'mnever sick of it. Perfect timing and acting, Albert Finney isas good as David Suchet in the role, and head and shoulders above Peter Ustinov. The cast is brilliant, with afew exceptions, who are luminous (Wendy Hiller and Lauren Bacall...what can you say?).  Never a dull moment.
