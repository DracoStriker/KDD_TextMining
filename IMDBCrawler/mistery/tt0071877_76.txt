Onboard is legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. He is called intoinvestigative action when a passenger is found brutally stabbed todeath, just as the train is ground to a halt due to heavy snow. Thiswill not be easy for it's a case where any number of the passengersappear to have links to the deceased.The best of the big screen adaptations of Christie's Poirot works,"Orient Express" is given a consummate sheen by director Lumet and hisall star cast. Finney's Poirot has a hard edge to him, which isperfectly in keeping with the story that unfolds. From the beginning,which brings a sad and potent piece of news to our viewing experience,right to the Poirot deconstruction of the crime-perpetrator-motivesequence, picture has dark tints framing the array of thespiansgathered for the occasion. The setting is gorgeous, but the confines ofthe period train add credible claustrophobic tension to the plot, andthe reveal, while not surprising to the observant, is still a doozythat is given added emotional heft by a neat character development.Darker than you may expect, but still a bunch of fun to be had playingspot the star and deducing who has done the foul deed. 8/10
