I'd never bothered watching Agatha Christie's 'Poirot' TV series prior toseeing this film, because I've always found David Suchet to be extremelyannoying. Thankfully, that wasn't a problem here as Albert Finney takes onthe role of Hercule "I thought you were French?" Poirot - and a good job hedoes too.SPOILERSBy randomly lowering and raising his voice, he manages to unsettle his'victims' into revealing all sorts of clues that don't appear to be evennoteworthy to the naked eye. But by the end Poirot's intricate process offinding the killer is revealed, showing how even the smallest details ofmanner and dialogue are all sewn tightly together: an Englishwoman referringto her 'lawyer' instead of her 'solicitor' meaning she must have spent timein America, Sean Connery proclaiming not to know somebody, then revealing indetail the military distinctions of that person, and Ingrid Bergman'slimited English somehow being able to pick up the most complexwords.As you would expect, the film is very wordy and how Finney managed some ofthose lengthy takes where he's linking every character together via allsorts of clues, is an achievement in itself.Amongst the rest of the all-star sprinkling is an Oscar for Ingrid Bergman(who I didn't even recognise until the credits revealed her - the shame ofit) for her "little brown babies" speech, Jacqueline Bisset in her customaryunder-used window-dressing role and Martin Balsam who, in the end, turns outto be right with his prediction of "that was the killer" after each personis questioned.A very good film, which you won't fail to enjoy.
