This is the best movie adaption of Agatha Christie's best story, "Murderonthe Orient Express."  The cast is superb.  This is one of Albert Finney'sbest performances; he plays detective Hercule Poiret. Albert Finney couldnot have asked for a better sidekick played by Martin Balsam.  Some ofthecast gave their best performances in this movie:  Lauren Bacall, MartinBalsam, and Michael York.  This is Richard Widmark's second best villainperformance.  His first was "Kiss of Death."The story is based loosely on the Lindbergh kidnapping.  The luxurioussurroundings are fun to watch.  A very suspenseful movie.
