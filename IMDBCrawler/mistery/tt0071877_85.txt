I must have been not older than 12 when I got into this old and enormousmovie theater and suddenly catch Albert Finney and Martin Balsam on thescreen and experience a rapture. And by the time the cast boards the train Iwas in absolute awe. Not only is this film perfect in every sense, but itplanted in me a love for Agatha Christie, Sidney Lumet, all-star casts,Geoffrey Unsworth, Richard Rodney Bennett and films in every sense. Togetherwith "Mary Poppins" and "That's Entertainment!"  it made me realize where myplace was.
