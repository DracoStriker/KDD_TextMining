MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS has got a feeling over it, a greatsuspense claustrofobic tight train feeling. Belgianmastermind-detective Hercule Poirot is going to take the train (OrientExpress, of course), but finds it snowed in, and an all readythreatened man is found stabbed twelve times. Who did it? It is Poirotthat is going to find out with his loyal sidekicks mr.Bianchi (Balsam)and Dr.Constantine (Colouris). The investigations can begin.This kind of movies can only be found the Agatha Christie-way.Spellbinding. Really. However, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is seen outof a direction's, editing, writor's view not that spectacular. The real8 lies in the mood, the set direction and the amazing star-cast thatmakes this movie worth seeing. Finney is absolutely hilarious asPoirot, screaming and yelling all the times, almost disturbing. Bacallis also very annoying, by purpose of course, Balsam great ("HE DIDIT!!!"), Ingrid Bergman speeks Swedish, Sean Connery is alsofantastically rough. But isn't Anthony Perkins' position a littlecrude. He suffers from traumatic illness from the death of his... yes,mother. It was good, but I'd say that the follow-up DEATH ON THE NILE is a verysuperior film. Better directing, editing, writing (if you really pauseand think a bit, you will found out who did it here, it is easy I seenow). It was indeed a not so well written story. I mean the finalconfession is 30 minutes. Couldn't it be a bit smaller. It's a bit of adisappointment, all he does is question the passengers and *shwish* heknows who it is.Loved it all the way through, but DEATH ON THE NILE is the ultimatePoirot-movie.
