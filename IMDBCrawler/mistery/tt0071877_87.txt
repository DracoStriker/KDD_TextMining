Very rarely does a motion picture version of a great novel match up to thequality instilled directly from the author.  Murder on the Orient Express,however, is one of those beautiful exceptions that proves the rule.  Athrilling film that will keep you guessing until the end (unless one hadalready read the book), Murder comes complete with an all-star cast whichincludes such favorites as Lauren Bacall, Sir John Gielgud, and SeanConnery.  (And as we've seen many times before, whenever Sean Connery getson a train, something exciting happens.)  The storyine begins understandablecomplex - while the viewer only sees and hears as much as Hercule Poirot -the film's hero.  But through some master directing and writing, all of theonce-confusing elements take shape and reveal a stunningly simple plot thatseems all-too impossible anyway.
