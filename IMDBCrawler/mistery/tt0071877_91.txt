Agatha Christie, I am thankful. Your novels are clean yet dark andsilent; your characters dimensional and your settings referential andprovocative. Sidney Lumet; congratulations. You managed to escape theprototypes of directing mystery stories; changing the lanes of citiesfor an enclosed setting such as the Oriental Express, with a marvelousatmosphere that chokes the unprepared and satisfies the cravings fornoir homage. Albert Finney; excellent job. You despised Poirot'sbrilliant straight thinking and impute your own sense of superiority tothe character. Salute to the cinematography; never a camera did showyou what you wanted with what you wanted to leave for the final. Asmart script offers an entertaining time and the train takes life ofits own. The music is chilling yet amusing, comfortably uniform. Theillumination diffuses to the "real world", you'll soon be askingwhether the lights got dimmer or the movie's atmosphere translated toyour room. Reader; I highly recommend you "Murder on the OrientalExpress". Its an old movie yet it seems to be an everlasting piece ofcinema.
