Sidney Lumet managed with "Murder on the Orient Express" to dosomething no other director of film based on a Christie novel had done.He pleased Dame Agatha. No easy feat, but possible because of thebrilliant cast. My personal feeling is that Albert Finney overactedPoirot, and was the wrong body type, from Christie's descriptions inher books, despite which he was believable. Ingrid Bergman deserved herAcademy Award win for Best Supporting Actress in this film. Everyperformance in this feature was carefully and skillfully crafted, aswell crafted as the beautiful sets of the train, recreated from onlypartial portions of the original cars. This is the kind of detailedmovie that works without special effects and with very flavorful scriptwriting. Not to be missed.
