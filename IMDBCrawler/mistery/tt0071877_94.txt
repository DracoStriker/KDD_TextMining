Hercules Poirot, the famous detective, is returning to his home inLondon after a professional trip to the East. Our story finds him inIstanbul, from where he takes the luxurious Orient Express train forCalais. The train is filled with many passengers, and (as usual) one ofthem is soon murdered. Poirot is convinced by his friend SignorBianchi, who is the director of the Orient Express, to conduct theinvestigation for the murder, but he has to act quickly in order toavoid a big scandal. As usual, he solves the case in his uniquebrilliant style.The director manages to create a thrilling atmosphere. Albert Finney issimply outstanding as Poirot, and Agatha Cristie herself has approvedof him. The rest of the cast are great stars and play excellently aswell. The script is perfect, with the events flowing smoothly and attimes (in particular, during Poirot's monologue presenting the solutionat the end) I find it to be even better than the book.The film demands the viewer's concentration and attention to everyscene and to every line spoken on that train. You cannot reallyunderstand why every detail is placed where it is placed withoutknowing the solution, so many things will become clearer during thesecond viewing of the film. But I really do not think that one canunderstand everything by watching the film only twice.Enjoy!
