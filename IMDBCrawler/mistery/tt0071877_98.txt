This is well cast and acted.  I have seen this film 20 times and I stillcan't see Albert Finney through the make-up, and his acting is wonderful.This movie would have had the hype of Ocean's Eleven if it was made todaybecasue of the quality of the cast.  If you have not seen it go look at itin your local video store.  Enjoy.
