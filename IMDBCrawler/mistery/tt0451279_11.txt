Actual Rating *** 5/10 (giving 1 here to compensate for all those fakereviews and morons who are rating this as best ever DCEU movie.Gal Gadot was not a good choice for WW, both physically(amazon ladiesare not stick thin models surviving on lettuce leaf diet) and actingwise(heavily accented and flat intonation with Bland delivery, you canclearly see that she's trying to constantly remember and try not toforget her lines). She may take note from Joe's Smell the Fart act :).Lot of plot holes: Why does Steve Trevor has to fly and die inplane..he cannot manoeuvre it to some isolated location and parachute,seems he missed those important logic lessons in his spy class.Oversimplification of war scenes, she runs in straight lines inbattlefield, all Nazi morons aim bullets on her bracelet so she candeflect them. The final fight was too cartoonish and didn't make anysense, without any explanation she suddenly finds the power to killAres.-No good dialogues or punch lines, All we hear are some corny jokes andGal acting naive/dumb scenes. -No clear explanation of her born powers/bracelets/lasso. Oh i knowthey wanna milk this secret knowledge and slowly release it in futureinstalments of WW. -No good hand to hand or combat scenes with weapons for a amazonwarrior, all CGI fights for a 9 min slot in 2nd half. -Damn slow pacing and not much story material, an NCIS episode of 45mins have more storyline/material and humour.The portrayal of World war storyline was so bad, it was made to lookoversimplified(maybe so 3 yr olds can watch this movie).On a side-note, its time to update WW's costume, it looks awkward andmore of an fancy beachwear dress.
