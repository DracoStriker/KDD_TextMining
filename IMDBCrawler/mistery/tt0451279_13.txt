seriously!? this movie deserves nothing more than 5 out of 10 stars.Terrible film. Acting was horrible. Story made little to no sense atall. Action was mediocre at best.. people need to realize that beingpolitically correct doesn't require you to give this film a goodrating. 1) the amount of cuts used was unbearable. When a director uses a lotof cuts, its usually because the scenes are action packed with timelessstunts. The stunts shown should not have required so many cuts. 2) the story was extremely rushed and left with plenty of plot holes.There was no introduction to her powers. just oh Zeus made you perfect.We do not know exactly what powers you have just that you're a godkiller. Wonder Woman knows nothing about the political side of the warbut automatically assumes with no good reason provided to her that theGermans are the bad guys.... what!? how is it we see her growing up asa child, then all of sudden stop aging. for a 100 years.... (WW1 ended1918... she was using a tablet. 2017 technology)3) due to what i believe was a terrible script, the acting washorrendous.
