My dislike of it could be understandable since I dislike superheromovies for some reason; they just bore me. I'm not the biggest fan ofaction but I prefer a little action in stories.This movie starts off with Diana reminiscing about her 5-year-old self.She wants to train in fighting and even recklessly jumped off a ledge.Later, the movie time-skips to a pre-teen Diana in disbelief about whatshe's supposed to be doing.I dislike dramas and not that big on war films so that's three thingsthis movie has that I don't like. The action was too fast for my brainto handle (I don't know what they put in those scenes to make it hardto keep up with) This movie had too much crying and sadness from peoplein it for me. Even an annoying baby crying voice. The melodrama thismovie had made me cringe and get nervous and this is the first film Iwalked out on. I don't like wasting money on movies but mommy and atherapist told me if a movie starts to make me nervous, I can leave.This is the worst movie so far that I've seen in 2017 and that's sayinga lot since Snatched could be considered the worst from the generalpublic but I don't know Amy Schummer enough, nor do I have a disdainfor her to hate it like other people do. But it was also not that goodof a movie anyway so I could kind of understand why people don't likeit.
