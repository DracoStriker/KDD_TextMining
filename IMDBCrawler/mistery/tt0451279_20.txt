The movie is filled with cgi effects that are all around bad. Physicsseems to just disappear and shots look awkward. Characters getsintroduced, characters that give no further development to the storyand are portrayed as stereotypes (drunk Irishman, the Indian, etc.).Furthermore all the Germans are portrayed as an incarnation of Hitlerhimself, the story tells that only Germans use gas and only Germanskill.The antagonists are boring and the story is so stupid and predictablethat it ruins the whole movie. But the thing that bothers me the mostis the most idiotic ending.The main "twist" is that Ares isn't the one making humanity evil, butrather mankind itself. This is totally forgotten when WW kills Ares andthe German army suddenly drops their weapons and everything is allhappy. (note that this ending is less than 20 minutes after it'sexplained that Ares isn't the bad guy)The portrayal of WWI is so bad that I wonder if the writer did anyresearch at all. Lastly the story is filled with plot holes andredundant scenes.DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP
