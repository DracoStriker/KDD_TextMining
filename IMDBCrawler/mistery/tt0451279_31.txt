This movie is terrible. Not the worst movie I've seen by DC, that'sSuicide Squad, which is why I'm giving a 2 instead of a 1, but stillterrible.There are plot holes and stupid decisions galore in this. The titularWonder Woman is intended to come off as an intelligent butinexperienced, emotional character, but instead comes off as aself-righteous brat who knows only what the plot needs her to know. Herand the rest of the Amazons have a fluent understanding of alllanguages (with a random assortment of accents) but are apparentlywillfully ignorant of the cultures, countries, events and inventions ofthe world.Princess Diana in particular is a holier-than-thou, we need to saveeveryone character, in the last leg of a war she didn't participate in.She judges everyone as cowardly or inhumane, but doesn't stop to listenwhat sacrifices had to be made or that suffering had been going onnonstop. She walks out to a battlefield and crosses a deadly No Man'sLand with ease, ignoring that soldiers have died there for over a year.It's easy to be judgmental when you're literally a superhero who can doanything, it's degrading to act that way to normal humans who die ifthey follow. Later she has a "touching" minute where the people shesaved are killed, before running off and never addressing that pointagain or learning any lesson.On the point of empty plot points, I suppose her family and friends areall horribly killed by the German destroyer that parked itself by theirisland, which is never addressed again.The brat character kills Ares, whose entire (forced) backstory is agross but acceptable deviation away from real mythology, saves the day,ends the war. No real mention or honest tribute to the millions whodied to get there, just one mythical brat and her goodwill/badlywritten love powers for a character who sacrifices himself needlessly.Go save yourself time and watch Sailor Moon. It's got more depth thanthis movie.
