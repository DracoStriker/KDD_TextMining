Warning Spoilers!!!!!! I was very dissatisfied with this movie. I didnot live up to the hype or the reviews it was getting. Here is why: Ithought it was going to be done as realistically as possible other thanthe fact there was an amazon goddess. Instead what I got was incorrectGreek Mythology. The movie also presented general Ludendorff as the"main enemy" when actually after Ludendorff was killed Kaiser was stillalive so the war was not over. Kaiser also had no board to consult withto negotiate an armistice because Ludendorff and "professor poison"killed them all. As a person who knows about WW1 history I wasextremely disappointed. There were also three characters that theytried to implement but were not memorable at all. I can't even rememberthey're names and I watched the movie half an hour ago. One of them wasa sniper who apparently can't shoot! For this point I have to give alittle backstory. Professor poison made a mustard gas that substitutessulfur for hydrogen making gas masks useless. Ludendorff then puts thegas in bombs and the bombs on a plane. There is a moment where all thebombs are exposed while being carted to the plane. It is later revealedthat the gas is flammable (well obviously, it's hydrogen!!). So if thissniper guy shot the bombs then they would instantly catch on fire andthe death of many (including one of the main characters) could havebeen avoided.
