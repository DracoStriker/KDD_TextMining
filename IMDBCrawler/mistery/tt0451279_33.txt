I never write reviews on IMDb, but I disagree so much with the 8+rating I had no choice.The aspect which bothered me the most about this movie, is that it isportrayed as a movie with a strong female lead. I expected Wonder Womanto be this cool warrior, being strong and independent and all thatother things strong women should be. But in fact, Wonder Woman was justdragged from location to location by Steve. Every time Wonder Womanshowed some fierce or anger, she was being shushed and told to leave(which she did). When Wonder Woman was introduced, the first thingmentioned is how beautiful she is. Further on, where are hermuscles???! She is supposed to be a strong warrior, but apparentlyHollywoods beauty standards are more important to portray. Anotherfemale aspect which was emphasized was her emotional side. In severaloccasions Wonder Woman portrayed empathy to humans, animals etc. whichleft her almost crying. The men in her environment told her to let itgo (aka don't be such a pussy), while they showed no signs of emotionas the stereotype man. It is like Hollywood had the intention to make amovie with a female lead, but in the process decided that the femaleshould be portrayed as usually is; beautiful, emotionally weak, needsto be controlled.And now I have not even started with all the other aspects which makesthis film so bad. Flat characters with very flat lines. Almost everyline is some stupid one-liner full of clichés. The makers started offwith WWII but halfway through switched to trenches and gas aka WWI? Iguess WWII was not interesting enough. Furthermore, the story followedthe typical story line build up, no surprises there. And of course morethings which did not make sense at all (the gas in the plane would killeveryone in an area of 130km square if grounded, but hey if I fly it500 meters up and blow it up no problem). The last line of the film andthus conclusion made the whole film silly: only love can save theworld... OH come on!
