This movie goes so very slowly its like watching paint dry.Getting used to the funny accents took a good long while, but i needn'thave worried this film gives you over two hours of boredom to get usedto the Israeli Amazons accents.Kind of reminded me of the Alexandermovie with Colin Farrell .He still had his Irish accent playing aMacedonian so instead of getting him to change it they just made allthe other Macedonian characters Irish????Her childish belief that Ares is responsible is repeated so often wejust know were being set up for a giant obvious fall when it turns outits just mankind doing what they do best.The action at the end is entertaining but not enough to make up for andhour and a half of completely being bored rigid.This film made me wishid died in world war one so i wouldn't have to watch it.
