My wife and I went to check this out tonight. We were cautiouslyoptimistic, but a) the DCU has produced three straight terrible films,and b) the trailers looked just bad. However, after the near universalacclaim, we decided to check it out. We knew we were in trouble whenthe timeline established for the creation of paradise island andDiana's birth contradicted each other. Zeus made the island with hisdying breath, then some time later he creates Diana from clay? How canhe do that if he is dead? Diana ages over some indeterminate time onthe island, but nobody else does, then she is Gal for over 100 yearswithout changing at all. No explanations are provided. Steve is in theOttaman Empire, steals a fighter plane, then makes it to paradiseisland in the same plane? The amazons know automatically what Germanyis, what the Ottoman Empire is, what guns and bullets are, yet hadnever seen/heard of any of these things before. They get from paradiseisland to London in one night in a sailboat and don't freeze in thecold ocean weather. On the sailboat, the feel the need to tell us Dianahas read 12 books on sex. Why? She also decides that pleasure doesn'tcome from sex? Again, why share that? Diana walks around London with asword, nobody says anything. Diana only really kicks butt aftersleeping with Steve, and decides only to fight for love. Say what?Diana disappears during WW2, Korea, Vietnam, etc. She doesn't fightwith humanity during any of these events, where did she go? How do westill have war if she killed the God of war? Diana loses her sword inher battle with the God of war, but has the same sword in BvS? Makes nosense! Seriously, this is just a short list of everything wrong withthis movie. Why is everyone saying it is so great, when it clearlyisn't? It is not even good feminist movie because of the whole need aman, and now I fight for love crap. What the heck people?
