I'm definitely the minority here, but I can't get over the fact thatthis film is rated higher than films like Enter the Void, Moonlight,The Kings Speech, Spotlight and sooo many other much better films. Thecritics took the money on this one and ran. To me, this film was cheesy, campy, and completely missed the mark. Theridiculous costume that is clearly symbolic for America ( there'sclearly a fuc*ing gold eagle on her chest and it's red white and blue),yet she hails from Greece and calls herself an Amazonian God - WTF?!!AMAZONIAN!?!?!? I was so confused. Then, there is an American who is aBritish Spy (huh?) Most of the German Nazis speak with British accentsand she can deflect bullets yet she loses her hearing to explosions....I'm sorry, but I just could not get past this to enjoy the film. As anorigin story, it's completely ludicrous. Maybe it worked back when thecomic was written, but today it just comes off as a desperate attemptto pry the money from people that want to be viewed as politicallycorrect. If you study film and take movies seriously, you should avoida visit to the theater for this one. Watch it at home for free and makeyour own opinion, but I can see this media-con being laughable in 20years.
