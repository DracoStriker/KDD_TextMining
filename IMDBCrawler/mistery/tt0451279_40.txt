Where to start? I decided to watch this action movie in IMAX 3D, thequality of the movie is so so because most of the battles and actionscenes is at night, evening, fog or dark environment (huge minus).Story is really bland and simple and very very predictive - evilGermans and good Englishmen trying to save whole world. The main ladycharacter looks and acts really funny. This wonder move should endswith song from the Shrek "i'm believer".
