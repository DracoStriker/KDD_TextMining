I heard a lot of good reviews about this movie - and how it might savethe DC franchise.... but i cannot agree.The story was really, REALLY bad. While having a nice framework of "whois good, who is bad", "is men good or bad by design, innocent butmanipulated by higher forces" etc. it gets lost in exposition, a ratherscattered assortment of scenes and bad guys that are not memorable.A big disappointment was Ares - mostly because i could not look pastseeing Remus Lupin from Harry Potter there. I do like the actor but hisperformance was weak, not at all menacing - not in a sense of godlypower, nor in the sense of manipulating intelligence or even arrogance.He was just Lupin in a silly costume made of too much bad CGI.The setting of WW1 could have been good - if it had actually describedWW1. The characteristic of the desolate no-mans-land, the stalemate andthe human meat grinder was only really pointed out in a short scene -and then quickly forgotten. The rest could have been a stock WW2battle, too.The movie itself had pacing issues in my opinion. It started with thechildhood of wonder woman on her home island. At that point - the storywas coherent and compact - with few but memorable characters. Once sheleft the island though...... the story began to dissolve into smallscenes of quickly changing locations. There was no connection with thenew characters (the members of the team), no connection to the villagethey "liberated" - and the enemy side was just a bunch of weakvillains.All in all ... i had more fun watching Batman vs. Superman ... and idid not really enjoy that very much either.It is a shame, because i think that Wonder Woman herself was well actedand done in that movie - only the story was bad (i have seen many MUCHbetter ones from the DC animated movie features in the past years - soi know they CAN tell good stories) - But a superhero is only as good asthe villain they fight... and the villain was disappointing.
