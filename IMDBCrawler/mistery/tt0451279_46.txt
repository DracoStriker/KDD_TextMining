I thought this movie could only surprise me in a good way, as from theposter and various images I had a pretty bad feeling about it andwasn't expecting anything great, yet it somehow managed to be evenworse than I imagined. Not only does it have the typical shortcomingsof all those same shitty adaptations, but it desperately tries andfails to submit a feminist icon.Let me introduce you to Wonder Woman.Coming from an island of women only, a man has to show her how tobehave in the real world. He also makes sure she's not too muchdistracted by cute babies or wounded soldiers she wants to help. Whenshe tells about some bizarre God stuff, the man needs to filter out thebullshit and convert it to an actual goal. When she's making a bigscene because too much violence in this world and peace is better thanwar, the man needs to calm her down. She wakes up from a night in abasic boat, her mascara perfectly made. She enters the battlefield likeshe entered a fashion podium, in slow motion please. She charges at abad guy, destroying the bell tower of a church, creating a havoc fullof dust and dirt, but her hairstyle is still up to an advertisement fora shampoo. She's trained to fight with a sword, but her costume leavesmost of her skin uncovered for some reason.When one tries to make a feminist movie, one should ask oneself howmany 14-year-olds will pause in the middle of a dramatic scene to fapto the lead character, because that's what happens when the focus is onsexiness of costume design rather than on depth of characterdevelopment. Maybe choosing Zack Snyder as the writer, author of SuckerPunch, were a group of girls looking like dolls fight a bunch of Nazis,wasn't such a great idea. The power that Wonder Wonder holds in themovie is purely physical. This is not what feminism needs. Where arethe scenes where WW has a brilliant idea, takes a game-changingdecision (apart from what starts the movie), or gain deep respect fromher peers? There is none.
