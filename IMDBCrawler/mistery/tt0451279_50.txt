I can't help but wonder if I watched the same film that impressed somany people. As with most DC Comics films, this one was a greatdisappointment. While Marvel Comics films tend to be satirical and evenself-effacing, DC films are pretentious and tedious. Sadly, WonderWoman was no exception to this rule.The scripting was totally unimaginative, with dialogue that bordered oninfantile. Visually, the landscapes all seemed plastic, with B-moviegrade CGI throughout. Even the music was awkward, fighting the dialogueduring the more intimate moments and drowning each scene ininstrumentals. I found myself doubting whether the director and editorare aware that there doesn't have to be a bombastic or floweryincidental score under everything ? it displayed a lack of confidencein the dialogue and acting carrying the scene.Regarding the acting, both Gadot and Pine gave it their best,struggling with the stilted dialogue and boring, telegraphed story line? but even they couldn't transcend this quagmire. If not for itspretentiousness, this film would have played far better as a comedy,lampooning itself. Instead, it drowns itself in incessant platitudes ofwomen good/men bad, framed within a plebian one-dimensional plot.Again, I'm at a loss to explain its high marks, other than to ascribeit to the currently trendy political correctness that elevates allpatronizing misandry to high art and entertainment.
