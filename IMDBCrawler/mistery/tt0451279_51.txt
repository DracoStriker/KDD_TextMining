Whether or not you'll love "Wonder Woman" no doubt will depend on theindividual. The die-hard superhero film lovers have embraced thepicture and it's setting box office records...and these folks reallyshouldn't read or pay much attention to my review. This is because I amover 50 and got tired of the genre long, long ago. I went to quite afew of the films because my daughters love them and this time was wasactually taken to the theater by my wife, as she loves the idea of afemale superhero. So, if you fall into my demographics...this review isfor you!The story is pretty different from my concept for "Wonder Woman". Thisis NOT a complaint...I know a lot of superhero stuff changes. Butinstead of the WWII setting I expected, the film was set during thefinal days of WWI. The history teacher in me was intrigued...especiallysince they actually got the look of the film just right--costumes,airplanes, soldiers, etc.. They also heightened the bleakness of theera by severely restricting the color palate to shades of gray andbrown--even the reds looked rather brown. I think this was a goodchoice...after all, war is horrible. Overall, there really wasn't much to dislike about the film. It hadTONS of CGI and action...and that is what many fans want. As for me, Iwould have liked a bit less and more focus on story....but that is avery typical complaint for folks like me! However, if you do get pulledinto going to see it, it won't bore you and offers a few nice twists.By the way, if you saw the film as well, were you ALSO horriblydisappointed when the lady scientist's mask came off like I was?! I wasexpecting so much worse.
