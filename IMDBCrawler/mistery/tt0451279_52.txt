As someone else pointed out, "1914, it is not." It started out quitefun, but swiftly degenerated into loonish stupidity, highly dependenton the ability to do slo mo as she flips around killing loads ofpeople. The premise that she could be instrumental in winning World War I is ahideous insult to the people who fought and died in that absolute hell. So it trivializes WWI as well as stretches our ability to suspend ourdisbelieve far past the snapping point. Do not waste your time.
