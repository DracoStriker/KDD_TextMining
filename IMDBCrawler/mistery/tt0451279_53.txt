Despite the initial intrigue posed by a prominent female main, thisfilm is lacking in the extreme. The studio decided to take a feministroute for god knows what reason placing a somewhat successful femaledrama director in charge of a superhero action film. The quality ofthis picture is more in line with some of the less successful superheroTV shows. The acting is lacking throughout, with no emotion in thecharacters, unlike in Zack Snyder's underrated Prequel. There is nomotive and the action is too slow which makes the whole thing lookextremely dull and unrehearsed. The only positive thing in the film isthe fact that a woman takes up most of the screen time, but in allshe's a bad actress. She looks as out of place on the screen as hercharacter in the cabinet room. I hope to see better acting from her infuture as there is so much potential. In all its a failed attempt atfemale empowerment that makes me throw up. There's no story, nocinematography and I hope to never see such a failure again. -Arthur
