Looking at these reviews i felt i had to write one myself. All i see ismarvel fans saying how bad this film is.Trust me this is a good watch iwatched in cinema and at home both times i enjoyed.the beginning is agood introduction of wonder woman and the Amazonians.If you are looking for a good action film with a good cast and storythis is it. The scenery is amazing and the action scenes look amazingthere are even funny scenes in this film.Don't listen to the haters who feel threatened by this film just watchand enjoy as i have and others.
