This movie should have been one that families enjoyed together . It wasa disappointment. Overdone, no story line, cheap imitation of theoriginal. Lazy scripting. The main character didn't live up to theoriginal character Lynda Carter. She was just okay. The only reasonthis movie is a hit in the box office is because it was already a hitfrom past generations and it was a DC comic character. All of the DCcomic movies are money makers.
