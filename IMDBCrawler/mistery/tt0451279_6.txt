I was SO excited to see this movie and thirty minutes in I was.........BORED! And there was another 110 minutes left! The acting was not greatand accents seemed to change every few lines for every character. Itseemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot insteadof acting - I think I caught "Blue Steel" face a few times. Gal isgorgeous but I did not get Amazonia princess from her - could they nothave found an actress with muscle? Felicity Jones in Rogue One was moreWonder Woman! Of course the movie had to throw in the bits about beingbeautiful AND smart - but not too smart because a man had to explainsnow and she was not so Amazonian that she didn't like looking dropdead gorgeous for the guys. Nope, no Wonder Woman here - just anotherHollywood "preach it" to the public movie only this time the super herois thin, scantily glad, super duper smartish/childish, andcondescending.
