I went into this movie with an open mind about male superheroes whilehoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spotssuggest. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make melaugh to make me care for the strong female characters and have someinvestment in the story, but I failed to achieve any of that. What Isaw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorlyedited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of thepoorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. Thecomputer generated effects were like something out of a live actionMarvel picture. The music, in particular the theme tune was uninspiringand added no impact or energy to the movie. I honestly can't think ofany redeeming qualities that this film has. After waiting so long for anew Lynda Carter film this comes as a major disappointment. Some thingsare just best left alone.
