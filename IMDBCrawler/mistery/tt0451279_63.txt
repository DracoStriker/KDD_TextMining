Honestly it kinda sucked. It was not what I was expecting at all, Imean originally I didn't have high hopes for this film. It came as aspin off from Batman V Superman (see my review for this) although itstarted alright with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman on the paradise islandthat is only inhabited by women the story went downhill from there.Although it did have some historical accuracy it wasn't very truthful,and I mean come on, when she's at the gala where Ludendorf is, how doesno one notice a massive sword in her backless dress. I know it is afilm but at least make it realistic, well more than it already is.Don't get me wrong some off the action scenes were pretty cool but shedidn't actually do much in them, compared to what other superhero's dowhen fighting the 'bad guy' she doesn't really do a lot other thandestroy what's around her and then in turn it hurts or kills the 'badguys' That's all there really is to say, it didn't impress me massivelyas a film so this review is quite short.
