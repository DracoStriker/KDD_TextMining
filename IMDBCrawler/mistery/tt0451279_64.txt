(actually 6/10 just compensating for the way too high ratings)I saw it today and overall it was pretty good, it wasn't a bad moviebut wasn't the best. Zack Snyder's mark of bad dialogue and overallskill of making movies worse in general was clear.Like most of DC's movies now, there is a lot of scenes and situationsthat don't make much sense. The most memorable for me was in the towerat the end where she is facing Ares. She reaches for Godkiller but it'snot there, she left it impaling Luddendorf, making the viewer thinkthis will create conflict. Then it cuts to a scene with Chris Pine,then back to WW jumping down now with Godkiller. So Ares just stoodthere and let her jump up and get her weapon? A similar thing happened when she was fighting Ares on the runway, andChris Pine came over and talked to her. Ares was just chilling thereletting her talk? Another annoying thing was the slow-mo. This effect can be used to goodeffect to let the viewer see an amazing movement that would be missedin normal speed. However, there is no point in using it onevery.single.movement. WW in slow-mo, Amazonians in slow-mo, everybullet in slow-mo. It was ridiculous by the end.With the casting, David Thewlis is a great actor and I do enjoy hiswork, but he just didn't seem the right fit for the God of War. Youimagine Ares as being intimidating and imposing, not having amoustache, being rather slender, and being super-British. Overall though, the story was tolerable, and the action was decent mostof the time. Gal Gadot is also gorgeous which doesn't hurt, but itdidn't feel they tried to over-sexualise her which was also good. Itwas still far better than Batman v Superman, and most DC movies, exceptthe Dark Knight trilogy. Still leaps and bounds behind Logan, andMarvel still has the edge.
