From all the superhero films, this was one of the most anticipated.Mainly because of the woman oriented theme. People were desperate tosee the solo woman superhero. Today, we have the great visual effectstechnology, that anything can be possible to bring on to the screen.And actress like Gal Gadot, even better it gets. Yes, it was awonderful film. A simple storyline, but a well made film.The Amazonians who are cut off from the rest of the world, is preparingfor the battle if Ares returns. All these years nothing has happened,but one day a fighter pilot crash on the cost of their island. Then theprincess embark a journey back with him to find, and end the Aresthreat forever. But she only ends up in the WWII, and what happens inthe following sequence are the rest of the film.Who would have done a better job than Patty Jenkins. She nailed it, andso set to direct the sequel too. Even the supporting cast was good.DC's visuals always high standards and so this one. Action sequencestoo amazing. There's lots of changes in the character, as well as ineverything. Firstly a nice superhero costume. And connections likeDiana's father, the island, all pretty nicely written out. The DCuniverse just got extended. I can't wait to see 'Justice League'.8/10
