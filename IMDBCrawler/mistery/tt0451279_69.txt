Being an avid comic book fan and a massive fan of the Wonder Womancharacter, I can honestly say I was really disappointed how the movieturned out. The character development was basically rubbish- we see howshe becomes a hero with no struggle to understand the world,responsibility or the true meaning and worth to truly become what wecan call hero. Which is why it felt very abrupt and sudden how thecharacter unravels to become the hero she becomes. There were so MANYholes in the story that were totally inexcusable: 1. Her whole journeyis kind of based on a hunch that Antiope has- Ares still exists 2.What's wrong if she does know she is the God-Killer? 3. If her motherknow she is the God-Killer, why refuse to train her? 4. Had SteveTrevor not arrived was there really a way to know that Ares lives andsubstantiate the hunch that Antiope had 5. Why would Hippolyta not lether come back? 6. Where were all the companions of Steve Trevor when WWwas fighting Ares? the whole place was literally hell and in the endthey just appear from under a metal sheet. 7. Wonder Woman is verystrong and can jump great heights- why then let Trevor die instead ofjust throwing it towards the sky? And so many more... The CGI wasabsolutely preposterous, the whole story (if her childhood isdiscarded) unravels in the matter of a few days (and that didn't helpadding depth to the character development), relentlessly long backstorythat's just monotonous and does no good to help the plot in anyway.Huge casting error when it comes to Ares' character. Gal Gadot is agreat actor no doubt but one can point out her inability to develop theAmerican accent which is why every Amazon had to learn to speak the wayshe naturally does. I have no idea what the hype is all about, it was a below par movie byall standards despite the great performances by Gal and Chris. Again,very heartbroken!
