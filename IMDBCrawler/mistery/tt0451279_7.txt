Warning! Slight spoiler alert if you are going to watch the movie.Personally, i thought this movie was ridiculous. The entire movie wasonly tons and tons of filler with nothing interesting except for thethree fight scenes, which were all ridiculous. Wonder Woman is to mejust a ripoff of Captain America. The whole world war setting, theshield which can deflect bullets and mortar rounds, and how she canjust dodge and see bullets coming, was pulled straight from CaptainAmerica. As a woman, i am an active feminist and i was glad theyfinally made a movie where women star in acting and directing roles.However, to me this movie falls just ahead of Catwoman in ratings.Don't waste your time and money with this movie.
