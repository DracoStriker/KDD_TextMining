Wonder Woman is the rise to form that the DC Extended Universe sodesperately needed. It follows the typical origin story formula, butit's more coherently paced and stabilizes the tone much moreintelligently than the previous DCEU installments. Gal Gadot nails therole of Wonder Woman with a deft balance of headstrong charisma andcomical innocence. The action is stylized and wickedly entertaining,and Diana's naive interactions with real world customs (especiallyduring a time period where women were looked down upon) make for someclever comedic relief. The first act was kinda bland with littleexploration and inventiveness put into Diana's home-world, but overall,I thoroughly enjoyed Wonder Woman. It renewed my faith in the DCEU andI pray that the filmmakers continue to learn from their past flaws andproduce even better spectacles in the coming years.
