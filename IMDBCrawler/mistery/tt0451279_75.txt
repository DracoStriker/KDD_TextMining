It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult toaccomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regularcomedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in thedramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughingthroughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh hasmatured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges,which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, whichplaced him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit thatThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film todate, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure ofwitnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, thisis a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I canrecommend this film to everyone.After the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out thelocal authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they'renot doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since thedeath of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting tosome, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverlywritten humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to thetable in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch.Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written ina way that will still find a way to make you smile.
