Dreary, slow, childish for 12yo's with bad acting (Thewlis, Bremner )or no acting (Gadot, Pine) from both leads who have zero chemistry andweigh the film down with their non-event romantic sub-plot. The actionis PG style with no sense of danger or horror in the WW1 trenches, thedanger is provided by the main villain Thewlis who looks embarrassed tobe starring in such drivel. The costumes are nice, the rest is soullesscomic book garbage for Millennials with Game Of Thrones IQ's.
