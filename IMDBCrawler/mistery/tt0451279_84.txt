I got to see this at an early screening and I am extremely happy toannounce that I love the movie! Gal Gadot was the perfect cast forWonder Woman! The action sequences are amazing. A great script and noediting problems (like in Suicide Squad). This is a very well madefilm. Patty Jenkins did a fantastic job. Chris Pine and Robin Wrightare also really good. Wonder Woman is inspiring and people will look upto her for decades because of this film. The only flaw I have with thismovie is the villain, felt very much just like a generic throw awayMarvel villain.
