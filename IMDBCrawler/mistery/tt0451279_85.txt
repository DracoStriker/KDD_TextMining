I knew this movie would be impressive and would break everything and Icouldn't be more happier then watching the movie and witnessing that Iwas right.The cast was formidable, they couldn't pick a more perfect actress thanGal Gadot, her portrayal as Wonder Woman was a massive hit, I felt herjoy, I even smiled when she smiled, I felt her lost, yes, it was hardsaying goodbye to a great character like Steve, and the emotions GalGadot expressed by her loss was so heartbreaking and believable. Iloved to know the origins of Diana Prince, it was amazing to see howfearless and persistent she was from such a little age.I couldn't not be more happier for the success of Wonder Woman, sincethis movie deserve it's recognition and value, and congrats to PattyJenkins because she was the right person to bring this masterpiece lifeand put the DCEU in the right path.
