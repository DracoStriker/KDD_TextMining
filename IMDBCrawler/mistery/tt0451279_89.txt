Looking for a strong female character driven movie? Look no further.Don't hate her because she is beautiful and has super powers.Here's a summer super hero movie that delivers. There is plenty ofaction and just enough sensitive quiet moments. Those with a heart mayeven shed a tear.The movie is loaded with CGI and any other available special effects.The first battle scene on the beach sets the tone. This is about goodversus evil. It's a good time at the movies and should be seen in a theater. Theredidn't seem to be much added seeing it in 3D. There are an abundance ofnight and dark scenes that need all the projection light they can get.Perhaps the 3D projection system and glasses make things a tad to dark. The strong box office will insure we will see more of Wonder Woman.Besides the most evil Germans were not those in WW I.
