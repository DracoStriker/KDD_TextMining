There's a lot that went into "Wonder Woman"; it's partially a romanticcomedy, coming-of-age story, period action/superhero movie, but maybeabove all, a love story. Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love -which doesn't sound like something that'd fit very well in a war movie.Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots tofill. The DC movies haven't been stellar up to this point, and theirinherent dreariness hasn't helped matters. And here's a movie withcompetent direction, gorgeous visuals and a lead actress that's fullyup to the challenge. Gal Gadot instills in her character honor,innocence, and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movieto the screen.In other words, it's everything I was hoping for in a Wonder Womanfilm. It doesn't feel like it was ground out of a sausage factory, andreally manages to do everything right. Just to give context, this iscoming from a guy who's pretty burnt out on the genre. I loved this movie.8/10
