What can i say that isn't vulgar and crude? I rarely mark a film with asingle star but this seems to have no redeeming features whatsoever.This film was a phenomenal disappointment. Im a big fan of the superhero genre and was hoping this was going to bea great addition - especially as there is a great need for a strongfemale lead. Unfortunately this film fails at every level. Even thespecial/visual effects were a let down.Coming as a spin-off from The Batman v Superman film and leading usinto the Justice League franchise I expected a mature direction.However this seems to be aimed at the socially awkward 'Twilight'generation of angst ridden teenagers! Both Gadot and Pine were wasted here. The dialogue and screenplay weresub-par and cringy. I have no experience writing either and while i maystruggle to compose any kind of screenplay, I'm certain I could vastlyimprove the dialogue and character interaction. Even the directionseemed lacklustre and awry. I've no idea how they could get so manyelements wrong without getting any right - even the law of averagesseems to have failed here!Quite simply: AVOID
