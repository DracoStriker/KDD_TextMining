Not gonna lie, when I first saw the Wonder Woman trailer, I was like,oh dear, hear comes another disaster of DC films. I truly had no faithin DC after the three bad movies that came before it. So I went intothe cinema expecting another Zack 'Slimer' film. OH MY GOSH, was that atreat for the eyes. Not only ere the visuals and soundtrack score onpoint, but the characters were likable and the acting was really good.I 101% recommended watching this film. So much happens that is justamazing. Thank you, DC. You have restored my faith in your movies. :)
