I am so sick of casting directors screwing up films with terriblechoices! Batman vs Superman was ruined by Jessie Eisenberg! The rest ofthe cast was superb so why stuff it up by casting such a bad lexLuther! I was excited by a Wonder Woman movie after seeing old seems with LindaCarter but was bitterly disappointed. I can understand casting Carterback 'in the day' but why choose a skinny, weak looking woman as anamazon today! Special effects and cgi don't make up for casting such aterrible Wonder Woman! Other than the terrible storyline that is full of holes any half witwould notice and the terrible cast, the movie ended up being barelywatchable. As a strong intelligent, independent woman, I am so sick of thisfeminist garbage which has been associated with this film! I hope casting directors wake up and stop casting the wrong people andscrewing up what could be good movies!
