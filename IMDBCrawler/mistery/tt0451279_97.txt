This is THE most useless waste of time to hit the screen since HOWARDTHE DUCK .... it's a Wonder how it made it into theaters. The storylineis very poor, and the acting matches it perfectly. There is no way Iwould recommend this tragedy to anyone. Anyone paying an admissionshould leave feeling robbed, and would have been better off donating toa beggar in the parking lot.
