Just to set something straight. Wonder Woman is way better than eitherBatman v Superman or Suicide Squad. It has what the others are missing,which is a "heart". Also, it's a funny movie with Chris Pine acting athis best. And no doubt, Gal Gadot seems to be the perfect choice forWonder Woman. Still...This movie suffers from the same reason as theother two movies, which is action and villains...It's too much CGI anda lot of times it is too obvious, it just ruins many of the actionsequences. This goes for the final battle as well. It's just worse, themain villain does not represent a danger in any way. It just floats inthe air and that's all...wtf... It really is too bad because this couldhave been a very good movie...Instead it's a movie with greatcharacters, fun,a great soundtrack, but broken by the action sequencesand villains which are just so bad...It's really a shame
