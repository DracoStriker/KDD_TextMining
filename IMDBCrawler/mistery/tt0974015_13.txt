In short:>Many instances where the CGI and green screens are painfully obviousand stick out like a sore thumb.>The editing is extremely rushed and abrupt in parts, with superimportant events such as Steppenwolf stealing the 3rd mother box beingmentioned in cringey and obvious exposition by wonder woman, beforecutting to a random event halfway around the world.>The fight scenes in this film are extraordinarily underwhelming. Inalmost all the fights, barely any of the characters use their powers,with aqua man simply punching and getting thrown away, wonder womanusing her sword instead of her OP abilities shown in her standalonemovie, and cyborg literally doing nothing except putting his handsinside a glowing box. The end fight was extremely boring andanticlimactic, with the tension immediately disappearing when supermanshows up and completely shuts down steppenwolf.> The villain himself, Steppenwolf, is one of the worst parts of thisfilm. He literally has only one power/ability, which is swinging hispathetic axe around. He is an all CGI uninspired and forgettablevillain who isn't menacing in the least. The fight he puts up in theend is disgraceful, with him swinging his axe around a bit then gettingcompletely trashed by superman.Probably in the minority here, but BVS for me was a 7/10, and this is a5/10.
