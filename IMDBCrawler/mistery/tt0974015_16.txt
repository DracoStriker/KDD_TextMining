The film was okay. Definitely not bad. How I wish Warner Brothersexperimented with more standalone films before they finally got toJustice League. As a big DC fan, I was a bit let down. 2hours wasdefinitely not enough to put this film's story across. There were greatplot points but everything just seemed to go by too quickly. HenryCavill's CGI upper lip was very distracting, and his superman- eventhough I really liked him- but he was just too powerful forSteppenwolf, or maybe Steppenwolf was the one who was too weak for thestory they were going for. For someone who wanted to destroy the world,I think he wasn't menacing enough. Ray Fisher was great as Cyborg, Iliked Gal Gaddot as Wonder Woman, Mamoa as Aquaman, and even Miller asthe flash. But I didn't like how the flash runs in this movie....hislegs move in a weird way. Batfleck owned his role obviously. There weregreat moments in the film, especially when Superman returns and meetsthe team for the first time. Loved his reunion with Louise and his Mom,and I'm really looking forward to where this universe will go.The first credits scene didn't do anything for me (I thought they'dboth run instead of Superman flying).Many scenes in the trailer werenot in the movie, and I feel like there was more to this film than whatwe get to see. The CGI also needed more polishing. It's definitelygetting a lot more hate than it deserves. I really feel sorry for ZackSnyder...I know the backlash he gets from people will definitely affecthis confidence as a director, especially for DCEU films and his visionof it. I give this movie a 6.5/10. An argument can be made for 7/10. Anyonegiving this movie more than a 7/10 is not being completely honest withthemselves. I really looked forward to this movie, but the theatricalrelease hasn't done much for me. Definitely a forgettable movie.
