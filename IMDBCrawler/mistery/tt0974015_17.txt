Like many other I have waited eagerly to see the movie but I havehighly disappointed On par with BvS.I was so excited to seeBatman,aquaman,The flash, Cyborg and my sweet prince Diana (wonderwoman) all together under one umbrella. All those gadgets of batman,Raw power of cyborg and aquaman are all seemed really bland anduninteresting to me.I am supposed to like this movie more than avengerscause this has 6 heros avengers had 4 and we barely knew any avengerbefore the movie.But we know all these characters before the JL movie.It has been seen in the past that these movies concentrate so much inactions and special effect that they put little concentration on theplot.And unfortunately this movie focused way more on action instead ofplot.It has a mediocre plot with a forgettable villain and his typicallarge team of warriors. The story wasn't enough to give the movie aperfect concrete base.They pretty much showed us almost all action scenes on trailers.Well itis normal since they released 4 trailers and tons of TV spotsThe bonding of characters wasn't seem to be deep enough or sincere.Wellit is normal cause it was like cyborg,flash,aquaman were all waitingand ready for batman,w.woman to find them and ask help.I had 0 excitement for this movie when the theater gave a break.Thismovie seemed as somewhat "x men apocalypse vol 2"The cyborg's cgi is almost like those shitty cgi s from dc/cw shows.Sorry DC.I cannot let you fool me again.I don't think I can pay towatch your movies for the next 3-4 years.
