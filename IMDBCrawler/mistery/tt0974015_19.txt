Justice League was Fantastic! This was for all the comic book and superhero fans and the DC Extended Universe delivered! There was plenty ofaction throughout, the plot was straightforward and it flowed well. Itwas a great time seeing 6 of the DC characters we know and love finallyget together for the first time on the big screen and theircharacterization and interaction was enjoyable and on par. This is nota movie laden with thought provoking questions or deals with heavysocial issues. It's just good guys vs bad guys and it goes great withpopcorn!
