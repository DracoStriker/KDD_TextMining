As a DC fanboy I give up and throw in the towel on DCEU movies, Justgive up and leave the awesome movie making to the more superior Marvelstudios, I felt a bigger connection to Meek on Thor Ragnorak to anycharacters on JL, The Flash character has been done before and betterIn Days of future past, Jason Mamoa looks like a biker more then theking of Atlantis, someone needs to feed Gal Gadot because I want mywonder woman a fit warrior not like Tom Hanks in the end ofPhiladelphia. The Story was as messy as Donald Trumps hair in thewind.The CGI was as fake as Kylie Jenners face. All in All I hate thismovie with such disdain. I hate it like Kevin Spacey hates boobies. Donnot waste your time and money go see Thor again.
