Imagine history backwards. Imagine that you were lucky enough to watchthe Edward J. Olmos' version of Battlestar Galactica first, and then,after a while, they came back with the Lorne Green's version of it.That's exactly what happened with this Marvel-infected version of theJustice League.Gone is the brooding menace of what people with these special skillswould harbor in real life. Gone is the sense of peril when you have thewhole world at risk of being destroyed by god-like forces. Gone is thebeauty of imagination beyond what Marvel would ever deliver.This is a parody of what the DCEU gave us before.We were THAT close to have a Justice League movie worthy of beingcalled art; instead, we got another forgettable Marvel movie.Thanks for what you gave us, Mr. Snyder.Shame on you, Weldon, for ruining the art of bringing comic books tolife.
