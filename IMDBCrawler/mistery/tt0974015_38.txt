Definitely better than bvs. However, considering the triumph that waswonder woman, this is a major step down! There is so many thingsJustice league can't get right and that just adds to the awkwardness.Eg. A visibly old batman who lacks charisma (ben looks so uncomfortableplaying bruce wayne as well), a dorky and annoying flash (I get it, hestrying to be the comic relief..just don't try too hard) as well as astyle over substance aquaman. Its not all bad though, despite that iswas mildly fun. Cyborg, wonder woman and superman were great!Yes...even superman. He finally smiled! The standouts definitely arecyborg and wonder woman. As for the forgotten...well let me see...ohyes! The villain! What the heck? What a lame villain. He looks like asea shell. A mollusk. Not scary at all and he cant even enunciateproperly! "What the heck are you saying if you have a tongue use it!"All i hear him say is "mother". That word never makes a villain likelike a bad-ass. The story was..meh.So I'll give this movie a 5.555/10. Twas pretty forgettable.
