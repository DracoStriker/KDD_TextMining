This was completely "meh" in most every way possible. Not offensivelybad like Batman V Superman, but certainly not good either. Everythingcame across as shallow and the CGI bad guy is the absolute worst. Whyon earth did they need to go all CGI and not use an actor? I do totally agree with studio execs that forced them to keep the runtime under two hours. Since everyone NOT Wonder Woman in this cinematicuniverse is terribly one dimensional, adding thirty minutes or more ofmindless prattle would have been a terrible idea. Basically, there isno developing characters this shallow to start with... might as well goall video game cut scene action. As for Wonder Woman, THAT is the trueace the WB has going for them. Not the character so much as the actressthey stumbled upon to play her. Talk about finding absolute gold. GalGadot hypnotizes and captivates on screen no matter what she is doing.Add action to her natural beauty and charm and you literally can't getenough of her in to the story. I'm sure they realize that the focusshould be on her from here forward. Of the new characters, only Cyborg has any hint of depth at all. BothFlash and Aquaman are cardboard wastes so far. So, the DCEU is trulystuck in the shallow end of the pool but maybe Wonder Woman cansingle-handedly tow the universe to deeper and more interesting waters.Best overall quote I've read: "Justice League was the cinematicequivalent of watching a classmate give a presentation they totallyforgot about"
