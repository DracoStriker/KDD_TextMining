JUSTICE LEAGUE An honest and insightful review by Navin NambiarI've waited for this movie for 16 years. Yes, 16 years?cause that'swhen the Justice League animated series started airing on CartoonNetwork. It was my favorite cartoon. I mean my absolute favoritecartoon. Do you get me? I'm also a fan of nostalgia and when I heardthat Danny Elfman's classic Batman theme & John Williams' score fromRichard Donner's Superman (1978) was going to be featured, I was overthe moon. My mind was just filled with countless ideas andopportunities of how they could capitalize on those themes and conjureup some truly epic mind-boggling scenes.Unfortunately, that's where I let myself down. Those epic scenes willforever remain a figment of my imagination. SIGH.As for the movie itself, the story was too rushed in my opinion. Theapparent WB corporate directive of keeping the movie shorter than2hours seems to have done a lot of damage to the flow of the film. Notthat 30mins more would make that big of a difference, but I can almostguarantee you that the director's cut will be slightly better. This isespecially sad for me since in the comics, DC usually churn out great,very well written story lines. Here, not so much. The movie lacked anydepth and all dialog consisted mainly of one liners and sad attempts toget some laughs. I don't have a problem with humor, but the humor inthis movie is so forced it became cringe-worthy. Too many "let's copyMarvel" funnies about it.If this had come out 10 years ago, it would have been pretty great,nowadays we expect more, want more, deserve more, and with this talentand all the money spent they should have produced a lot better movie.So summarize, Justice League is an okayish Superhero movie. I'm gonnasell the two Hot Toys characters that I've pre-ordered. They don'tdeserve a place in my cabinet. I miss Christopher Nolan and his BatmanSeries. I'm disappointed :(
