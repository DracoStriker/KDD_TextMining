Wow where to start. First off HUGE disappointment of a movie. Why wasthis even made is what I was asking myself when it finally finished...There is no substance with terrible directing and utterly boring actionsequences that have no sense of purpose or lead to anything meaningful.It is a worse version of BvS and by a long shot too. Imagine BvS withanother 5 more heroes. Yeah you get my drift... I'll give it a generous2 because Wonder Woman movie was top notch and she happened to be inthis.
