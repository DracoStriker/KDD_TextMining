Let me be brutally honest. There are no redeeming qualities about thismovie. The plot is a large ball of string that has been tangled beyondrecognition and the characters offer absolutely NO emotionalinvestment.The movie jumps from scene to scene with no real flow AND no cleardirection. Halfway through the movie I genuinely wondered how I gothere and why the movie is halfway done when it feels like it's been 5minutes of "story".I truthfully cannot understand how people can be rating this 9 and 10stars. WB do not make good DC movies. I understand it's frustrating butpretending it's a good movie is hurting your chances of ever actuallymaking them good in the future. Telling a lie enough times might makeyou believe it but still does not make it true. WB have no incentive tomake good movies and it is very sad. The whole thing stinks of a cashgrab. Do not waste your time with this garbage
