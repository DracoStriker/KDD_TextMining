This was an amazing movie. These so called "critics" got it wrong. Itwas phenomenal. Fun ride from start to finish. Superman was the perfectgarnish to a great stew of amazing characters. He came at the exactlythe right moment, not stealing the thunder of other heroes. wellbalanced. the team dynamic was amazing. You could see how superman'sdeath had caused evolution of Diana and Bruce. you can see how theflash isn't perfect and is just a kid starting out. loved this. betterthan any of the marvel movies this year( FYI I loved all of them exceptThor Ragnarok,(comedy on point, but nothing else)).
