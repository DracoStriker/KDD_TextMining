.... the level of character development, story line and special effectsof Destroy All Monsters?The CGI is bad! You notice a certain person has bad CGI around hisupper lip. Because his commitment to his role was on par with CesarRomero. You couldn't grow that thing back in a few weeks?I'm reading a lot reviews with the attitude of everybody deserves atrophy, when the reviews aren't downright condemning. There's a lot ofmention of the troubles during the shooting. I don't give a damn! Alsoa lot of the high mark reviews are by the typical just joined IMDb towrite THIS REVIEW, and you'll never see me again.(phony)look at thedifference between IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes! How can there be that biga difference? I'll tell you how, fans can manipulate IMDb, that's how!How can people justify giving this high marks, and then explain all themisfires, and they did it on the hopes NEXT TIME they'll do better? Imean seriously, read about 20 reviews by people who rate it highly andyou'll see they admit they over rated it within the review.You've had several shots at this now DC/Warners. Was Wonder Woman ablip on the radar? The villain has no personality! I'm just here forthe mayhem, and the buffet. I see several people give this 3 stars fora few nice panels. Really that's enough for you, a few nice hero poses?This is literally the short bus version of a major blockbuster! Sureit's going to do Batman vrs Superman numbers, but is that what theywere shooting for?
