Wooden acting - Check. Breathtakingly bad CGI - check - Poor lifelessscript - Check - Scrappy editing - check.I can see some fans like this film but they need to understand thatthey would have come out with an even bigger smiles on their faces ifthis film had been made properly. By the number quips punctuating the appallingly rendered CGI actionsequences and shallow characterisations (sorry Aquaman) end up makingthis film drab. I had no empathy for any of the characters.If we look back to the Superman film of 1978 - it was full of colour -entertaining characters who we cared for and had a sharp witty script.But these modern day Hollywood moguls have let one side of thesuperhero badly down. The Marvel side has fared pretty well butsomething seems to have gone wrong with DC (except Wonder woman)If there is a next film the producers need to invest in a cleverintelligent script and throw out any demands for one written for kiddieaudiences.The director should insist that real locations are used(where possible) - so the actors don't get bored having to pretendthey're somewhere other than in front of a green screen. But above allinvest emotion into the film.DC fans deserved better than this - Snyder -Terrio - Whedon - hang yourheads in shame.
