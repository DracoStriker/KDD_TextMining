Is there a conspiracy against DC? This was an 'Amazing' movie. Superbacting by all actors. Gripping story line. Definitely setting up stufffor much grander movie settings for the future movies. Don't know whypeople go on a witch hunt bashing DC! :@ :# It's not always supposed tobe an all time HAHA movie, which the audience is used to nowadays Ithink... It is a SUPERHERO movie people, will be dark in few places....Whatever the super critics turn up their noses and say... We people,the 'common' audience do like the whole movie! :)
