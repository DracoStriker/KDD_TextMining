I'm a die hard marvel fanboy. But honestly nowadays marvel just way outof their tracks turning their action movies into somelow-budget-cringy-parody movies. It's not cool, man. Especially whenthey ruined Thor's characters. It makes me upset.But for this Justice League, I was amazed! The jokes are on point, theyplayed the characters so well and natural, and so realistic for today'ssociety! And the punch-up-lines of the jokes was on point, so cool,without ruining any characters just like the Comic Books! But idk whythe Batman feels so dark this time...Yeah, I'm the sad marvel fans especially for the Ragnarok movies.Although the Justice League movies plot was simplified and played in asafe way plot, it really made me fulfilled for craving such a cool-packsuperhero movies! Well done DC!
