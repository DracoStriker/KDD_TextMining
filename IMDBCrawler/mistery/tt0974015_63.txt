The movie is an epic come together of some of the most iconic heroes inthe DC Universe.Fortunately, the jokes are kept to a minimum and only on occasions thatwarrant a joke or a punchline. There is no comic relief when thesituation is dire on-screen.The heroes are exactly what you expect them to be (for those who knowthe comics and the characters) and their reactions are true both totheir character and the situation that arises around them.It is the first glimpse to the extended universe of DC, which promisesto be spectacular.
