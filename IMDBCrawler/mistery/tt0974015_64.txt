Marvel fans will like it. Thats all I need to say. Disappointed that DCdecided to abandon their darker atmosphere to try to appeal to thecrowd but I guess you have to make money somehow. The Good: Superman's few scenes are excellent. The Flash, with whom Ihave never identified, was the best thing about the movie. First timebig picture embodiment of Aquaman and Mera is surreal. The Bad: The story-line was average at best. I understand this is justa set up movie which is the only reason I gave it something as high asa 6. The writing and acting were not good. The Ugly: The CGI special effects in comparison to Man of Steel and BVSwere incredibly bad to the point where it added a thin layer of cheesesimilar to that of Wonder Woman. Overall: Huge disappointment.
