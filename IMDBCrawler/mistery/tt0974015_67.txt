After watching BvS I have not expected much on this sequel. Surprise,it is a bit better than the loud and noisy BvS. But still has someelements from it.Better character development (Josh Whedon ?), fight scenes still looklike video game scenes, some scenes are rushed to be shrunk in an2-hours movie,... The Villain is boring. After hiring Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, CaraDelevingne in Suicide Squad (not related to her BTW), the DCEU is stillcontinuing with plain and boring villains.Conclusion: a bit messy.Not the film of the year but improvement from BvS but not enough to beattached to the characters.
