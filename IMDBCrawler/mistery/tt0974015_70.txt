I'm not a fan of DC films, but after being amazed when I watched WonderWoman, I decided to give Justice League a try. I recommend that youwatch the first films also before Justice League.I don't know, but this movie seems average to me. Justice League didn'timpress me much. There are some pros, like Gal Gadot's wonderfulperformance. She is my favorite. To be honest, she is the only one Ireally like here. The others' acting are just OK. There is also a bigtwist in the story.However, there are also some cons. Main plot is pretty much messy andpredictable and so is the villain's characterization. Also in some ofthe battle scenes particularly the climax, there is too much specialeffects/CGI and I didn't find it really appealing. I find this movie OK.
