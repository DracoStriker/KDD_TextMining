I cant really start to type anything but to trash this movie with thisawful CGI and its over reliance on it I dunno what Zack Snyder is doingwith the 300 mill budget really no plot what so ever and nointroduction to the villain or the team and the super downgraded Batmanand the god awful big black bathing suit and its just doesn't feel likea DC movie with all the laughs and bad jokes and please Zack change theway you direct the yellow tint is really annoying it was fun back in2006 when 300 came out but not anymore.please resign and stop ruining more DC movies I and many more thinkthat way
