Word of mouth will hurt this thing because it's mangled and dumb withno heart at all. Quite frankly, too dumb to enjoy. I know fanboyseverywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in andof itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it andapparently will look past all of its flaws.Everyone else is saying or will soon be saying that JL is a dumbpopcorn flick at best but really nothing special and just as bad asBvS. How can a film follow something that bad but still give anyonehigh expectations? Yet, thanks to good trailers, that's exactly whathappened.Well, the actual movie is going to lead to general disappointmentespecially if you're not already a fan. Campy, cheesy fluff pretendingto be dark and serious usually fizzles out fast. Yet, as MOS provedthis may be an indestructible franchise that won't die no matter howbad the stuff they churn out. No spoilers but trust me, the endingwon't leave a good taste at all.Just think, some people thought they were disappointed by MoS and BvS.If that's the case, then wait until they get a load of this thing. Theyadded Flash,Cyborg but dragged that cool characters down to this level.
