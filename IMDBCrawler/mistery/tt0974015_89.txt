I had such a good time watching JL, the crowd was cheering, laughingand applauding! This movie focuses on the Justice League members comingto know each other in order to take down the Apokolips outcastStepenwolf. There are such unique amazing moments in the movie that Icant talk about. Overall loved it and felt like I needed to see a solomovie for each member!
