I wanted to love this movie, but it suffers from the same mistakes asBatman v. Superman. The plot is jumpy and incoherent, the motivationfor the characters are sloppy, and the CGI is lackluster at best. Plus,Henry Cavil's face looked off in this move; you can tell they did a badjob removing his mustache. This movie wasn't all bad though. I thinkthe characters and their interactions with each other are the bestthing about this movie, but the characters are failed by a terriblescript and choppy editing. This movie also has a villain so boring thateven Marvel would be jealous. I think Warner Bros. need to make bigchanges to the DCEU or it's doomed to fail.
