Woah, just watched the movie today and I can say that I am relieved.Going into the movie I was very nervous, but now that i have watchedthe movie, I can say its worth the watch.Due to the two hour time limit imposed by Warner Bros., the moviedefinitely seems quite rushed. Because of that, the introduction to thecharacters seems a little off. Since, I already knew how thesecharacters became who they are, I could make sense of what was going.But for casual movie watchers, its not going to be that great butdefinitely a entertainment flick for sure.The great side of the movie was the characters and the chemistrybetween them. Watching them on the big screen is a dream come true. Ithought Ezra Miller as Flash was awesome and very funny. I can say thesame about the other characters: Aquaman was bad-ass although he hadless screen-time, Cyborg was definitely cool and Wonder Woman is asalways charming. The other best parts of the movie would be Superman. Iwould say Superman stole the show. The CGI mustache wasn't thatnoticeable. But overall he did great. I can say the same aboutBatfleck. Ben Affleck as Batman is awesome.Now the bad parts of the movie. The main issue was with the villain.Steppenwolf didn't seem so strong. Whenever he was out of the screen, Ididn't really care about him. Also rushing is also an issue herebecause of the two hour limit. The CGI could be even better, but it waspleasing.As a comic book fan, to see the references made in the movie wastotally great. And there are two end-credit scenes. You definitelydon't want two miss them. I had a great time watching the movie. And Iam very hopeful for the upcoming DC movies.
