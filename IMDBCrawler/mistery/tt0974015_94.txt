I just saw the movie and I would definitely see it over and over again.I did think there was a cheesy, campy part or two, but it is what itis. I REALLY liked Aquaman. I wish they would have made him come backat Superman after Superman knocks him away, but they blew that chance.That really would have given people a second thought about the King ofAtlantis. He was such a bad-ass nonetheless. I can't wait for part 2. Iwish Darkseid was going to be in it, but after the end credits, theymay be heading in another direction. Definitely go see Justice League.It is definitely 2nd to Wonder Woman.
