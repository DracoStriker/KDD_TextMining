This is actually a pretty decent DC movie. it's not as good as wonderwoman (though not by much) JL is definitely much better than MoS orBvSDoJ. though i wasn't really hyped for this movie i was reallyinterested in seeing it. at first it started out kind of confusinglyand the worst parts of the movie are from the start, the movie getsmuch better the more it progresses. the villain was pretty OK. thoughhe was the usual expendable superhero movie villain he did seemthreatening at times. so let's get to the characters: most of thecharacters were just fine i guess. they weren't terrible nor they weresuper amazing. flash has some good jokes. Aquaman was really made to becool again, cyborg was basically like a robot (pun intended) and wonderwoman was mostly just like in her movie. the best character of themovie is (very surprisingly) Superman. there is a scene right after heis brought back to life when he is (kind of) evil (i think) andfighting the justice league, especially when he gets to batman... he isterrifying AF. now that obviously isn't the only reason he is the best.this time he actually has some character. he has some nice lines ofdialogue and the filmmakers even tried to pay homage to Christopherreeve. in short: Superman isn't boring like in Man of Steel or Batman vSuperman and for me this movie redeemed Henry Cavill. Lois lane isn't.she's still the same boring Lois lane as in BvS. she had a scene withClark's mom and it was the worst and most boring scene in the movie.her only purpose was really to make Superman ,,not evil anymore.''Batman was changed from BvS a little probably because people consideredhim boring. he does have a few funny lines but he's fine i guess. sofinal sentence: probably the more fun DC movie which could be betterbut you can enjoy it.
