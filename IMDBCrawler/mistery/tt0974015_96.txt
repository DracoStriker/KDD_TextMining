Marvel seems to be able to create fantastic chemistry between thecharacters that DC can't achieve. I enjoyed most of the casting of myfavorite super heroes except for Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is so onedimensional and extremely boring! As a supposed 'Amazon' she looksridiculous. She is not tall, muscular or anything like an amazon. I amshocked anyone enjoys her portrayal of Wonder Woman but I supposepeople's expectations are extremely low and just happy to have a WonderWoman even if she can't act! The CGI was terribly done and too obvious but I did enjoy the overallmovie but thought marvel would have done a much better job all round!
