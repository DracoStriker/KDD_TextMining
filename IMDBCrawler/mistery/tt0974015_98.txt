i think this movie is for family . its not too dark like batman vsuperman or like captain America civil war or like other dc movie ex:Christopher Nolan batman of course. i m glad that my kids is happy towatch this movie.at first i thought that this movie can make my kidsleepy like other dc movie ,with heavy plot and etcetera.but this movieis exception the tone its very light the picture its not too dark.andof course its funny...but not like Thor Ragnarok funny but still itsfunny (credit for the flash).batman is not sad anymore and full of ragelike before.this batman full of optimistic.wonder woman scene firsttime is perfect(bank robbery scene). but like others dc movie there isa lot of hole in the story. my conclusion is watch this movie with allof your family member don't listen to the haters and rotten tomatoes.movie is a movie.. after all its doesn't hurt anyone. I'm glad live inindonesia ...good movie always come first to my country...
