Everyone was laughing it was so bad. I just felt stupid because Ihaven't been to the movies in two years and I wasted my time on thistrash. NOTHING like the first two. I kept expecting them to stop themovie and say it was a joke and play the real movie the whole time. Thefirst bit is too dark to see anything, then by the time you do it'sjust total crap. I've seen better effects on YouTube, and the storymakes no sense.
