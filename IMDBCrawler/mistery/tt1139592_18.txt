I have to say that I really enjoyed the first two installments for thisfranchise. They were original and well done. Then we get to the thirdentry. I am sure this was a made for DVD release film that theproducers decided to get a few more dollars out of and released it forone day only at the theaters. Smart ploy. Who would want to see it theafter the reviews from that first day were released.This film was horribly acted. Brandon Smith plays the incompetentSheriff Tubbs. He is so over the top. Horribly over the top that hisperformance almost comes across as comedic. Meg Foster, who is areasonable actress, but not an Academy Award performer, is sadly almostas bad. The rest of the cast is much the same.Gina Phillips is in the last five minutes of the film, even though sheis billed as a top star. The plot is so convoluted that it isconfusing. The cinematography is poorly done. The direction is poorlydone. The acting is poorly done. The script is poorly done. Getting thepicture? And the twist in the second to the last scene was nothing morethan a contrivance.And finally, Victor Salva had two of his trademarks in this film aswell: slow pandering over the backsides of the hunky young stars andmaking sure those same guys had to take their shirts off. We all knowabout Salva's, but squeezing these events into every film regardless ofnecessity has become a bit much.
