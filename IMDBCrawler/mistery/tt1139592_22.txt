I've waited close to 15 years for this? Jeepers Creepers 3 was one bigold mess. I immediately knew something was up when its premiere was onthe SyFy Channel. Now that could be for several reasons-- there wasmuch ballyhoo about how this film was going to be protested and"blackballed" (so to speak) by fans because it seems director VictorSalva was found guilty of child molestation/child pornography. This product seemed unfinished, rushed, and slapped together in orderto make (a) a little money; (b) try to please all the restless fans whohave been patiently awaiting this installment; or (c) strike while theiron was hot. The film MAY make a little money; however, it's not going to please thefans, and watching the film up to the end is like having sex for 90minutes with absolutely no payoff. Instead, the viewer is left askingwhether or not there will be a Part 4. My question about that is: ifthere was this much trouble getting Part 3 released and with continuedthreat of more boycotts, what would make those involved with this messthink anyone would pay for a Part 4?Unrated (I think) and damn near unwatchable.
