This will go down as the worst sequel to any franchise. It's bad enoughthat fans really loved the first one, and even found things to like inthe second movie. 14 years later! And this is what we have. It was shotmostly during the day. The jeeper guy had a mask on and wore a redshirt. Just plain cheesy. Absolutely no take always or plotdevelopment. Bad acting, horrible effects and now I'm just f up spacehere so I can finally move on with my life and write this off as onebad experience.
