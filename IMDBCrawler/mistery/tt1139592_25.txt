Can't really remember the last time I was this disappointed. Maybe it'swhen I lost a loved one. That's how bad this was. Honestly I think theworst thing about this movie was the depth perception. Example, guysare full throttling motorcycles and one gets hit with a spear from whatlooks like at least 200 yards, cut back and their literally 80 feetfrom where they started. The next unbelievable thing for me was thatthe monsters hand lifts the old woman up in the air like it can fly. Sowhat does she do to keep it from getting away? She puts a flower pot onit, lmao. Not to mention the huge hole in the pot! Anyways, I can't putany more effort into this review, it's still more than the creators putinto the movie however. Bottom line, Jeepers Creepers this movie blows.
