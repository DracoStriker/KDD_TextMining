This movie was absolutely horrible (and laughable) in just about everyrespect. The truck itself is the star of the movie and even that'sweak. I was wondering why the movie was already being shown on thesy-fy channel. It took one minute of actually watching it to see why.lol Disappointing, to say the least...
