What the audience expected: Origin story of the Creeper. What the audience received: Several characters verbalizing 'We knowwhat you are' Said characters never revealing what the Creeper was. Highlight of the movie: The Creeper's truckAfter watching so long for this addition to the Jeepers Creepersfranchise, it was a big disappointment that the origin story was neverrevealed. As stated above, several characters made acknowledgments thatthey knew the Creeper's origin (and came to find out in a veryinteresting way, which I won't spoil for anyone). I'm waitingthroughout the whole movie thinking, okay, they're going to revealit...NOW! But no. That point in the movie never came. No origin revealeven though the whole movie was based on...Guess what? We now know whatthe Creeper is so maybe we can beat him! Such a big let down!
