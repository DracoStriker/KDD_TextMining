i am the kind of person who will watch a good horror/thriller if itsounds interesting with a low rating, i just think 'why not give it atry, and some times they end up worth he watch. but this was NOT one ofthem movies. i don't know if it is because i know how great the other 2are, so i am comparing, but either way to me this movie was not worth awatch. from the whole boring police scenes, and the shitty acting fromthe leads, its ridiculous !! i loved how jeepers was set around acouple, then a bus.. this... was set around boring police and a reallystory line! defiantly did not have the same feel to it as it did !i am NOT a hater of new franchises being made and remakes. but this isjust a let down, should of just left it were it was!!
