What was with the visual effects? They were garbage! it was like theythrew the Creeper into a bad SyFy channel movie. Some times his wingslooked awful and the crows looks like Halloween store props. What waswith those overly cartoony Mario Cart balls? Overall, I am glad to seethe Creeper back. But i am very let down with the movie. Especiallywith how long we waited for it. I hope they learn from this and makethe 4th HUGE and this is just a bridge to set it up. Also, most of theacting was laughable.
