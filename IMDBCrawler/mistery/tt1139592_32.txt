I enjoyed the one night event the film had with fathom events! Themovie was really good, had some cringe worthy moments, but was overallawesome! Yeah, the CGI was terrible, but the practical effects wereincredible! The film is by far the scariest of the series, but thefirst film is forever the best! I still can't wait to own it on Blu-raythough, and watch it again for a second viewing! And I will watch thisfilm every year with a marathon of all 3 films!!!
