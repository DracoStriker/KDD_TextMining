Finally sat down to write a review on this garbage.First of all I lovedthe first part really also the second one was good.Had many manyexpectations from this one but....I don't know yaar what were theyplanning and doing in 14 years of gap while finally making this one.Theplot was bad.Its actually shows us about what happened between thefirst and the second part come on man who wants to see that whathappened between the first and the second part we want to see whatsafter the second one..half of the time is wasted in this.Then theactings were really bad.Not that much scary shot as we expected. Sofinally a bad one.Will definitely disappoint you.Avoid it....
