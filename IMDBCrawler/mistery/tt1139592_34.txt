I grew up watching Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2 and couldn't wait for the3rd. After watching it i felt let down by the story, the actors and the"special effects" This movie has ruined it for me and does not live upto anywhere near the 1st and 2nd. The creeper does not even follow thesame hunting rituals like in the first 2 movies.
