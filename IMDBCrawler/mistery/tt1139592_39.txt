Don't waste your time on this one. Salva clearly didn't have the budgetto do the Creeper justice. Instead of the scary monster from the firstmovie we get a drunken hobo waving a dime-store toy axe. The plot ispractically non-existent, the acting is terrible and I've seen scarierepisodes of Scooby-Doo.This is a bad bad film and Victor Salva should hang his head in shamefor cheapening the whole series with this rubbish. Avoid at all costs.
