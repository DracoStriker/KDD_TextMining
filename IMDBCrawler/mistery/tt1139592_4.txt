I love the Jeeper Creeper Series but this was terrible. From drive thetruck while standing on the hood, the rigged truck, the buried hand,and overall poor acting, except from the horse. I watched better actingon "In the Heat of the Night" in "Sparta Mississippi" and in my CharlesBarkley voice, this movie was turrible.
