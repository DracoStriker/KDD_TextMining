very entertaining! exciting! the characters were likable and i foundmyself rooting for them not to be killed, except the monster of course.the story line could have been tighter and explained better,especiallythe part about the body part.the acting was good and most of thecharacters were believable and they did not do a lot of dumb stuff likescreaming when it was not warranted.i really enjoyed this horror movieand i would recommend it! this movie is not as bad as some would say.let's say i am not wishing for my time back! i would watch it a secondtime!
