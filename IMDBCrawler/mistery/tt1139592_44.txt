Omg! The director should have NEVER made a 3. This was the dumbestmovie. It made me mad because the actors were stupid and so was theplot. It made no sense and whoever wrote the lines should never writeagain.The decisions that were made in the movie was not realistic atall. Dumbest decisions were made. It deserves enough rating because itwas low budget and crap.
