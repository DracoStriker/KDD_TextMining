First of all I am going to put my hands up and admit I never made it tothe end of this film and I would normally never write a review unless Ihad watched the whole thing. I am making an exception because I knowmany people, myself included, have great fondness for the JeepersCreepers films and must be warned. This is awful and I mean reallyawful. The first film was quite scary, the second less so but quite funbut this is a giant turd. The acting was questionable at best, thecreeper was laughable and the plot was pretty much non existent. Itkind of felt like the cast and crew were just turning up at differentplaces and making it up as they went along. It had the production valueof the video I took of my kids school show. If you like the previousfilms as much as I do then please don't watch this, it will spoil yourfond memories. I really wish I had read the reviews first.
