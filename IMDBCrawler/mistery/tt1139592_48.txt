That was one of the worst horror movies that i have seen so far , thestory was awful and the computer effects were disaster they were madeby very nonprofessional team The cast were bunch of non actors tryingto be actors. It was a very low budget movie , and was a bad mistake tocontinue with the sequence They should have stopped the production atthe second movie
