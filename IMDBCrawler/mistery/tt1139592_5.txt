After waiting 10 years for the next installment of horror movies that iLOVED, this movie was utterly disappointing. The. movie begins inbetween 1 & 2 somehow, still placed at night like the first one didn'tend in the morning after the creeper took Darry and took his eyes andkilled him. I don't see how he magically got time to take Darry, flyaway, take his eyes out after carving his head out, stealing his truckback, all in one night? I don't get how. They made him entirely too"human" like. He seems to have lost his monsterness when it comes tobeing the creeper from the first film. Also, his new uniform isdisgusting for lack of better words. He is not the same creeper who wasas ruthless as in the first one, not as menacing and really just notthe same overall. How was he so terrifying in the first two movies,using all his own weapons with no sign of any attachments to his truckbesides the cow attachment but somehow he has upgraded?? he was enoughof a monster before to where he just needed it to get around and makehis way to and from his hideout. They made this movie "funny" and tome, that is a bad bad sign, because this movie isn't even supposed tobe funny. there was more love story than it was finding out who thecreeper really was or is. only hints, that weren't really hints weredropped. You didn't find out any new information, just rehashed info wehave gotten from the first two-- "every 23rd spring he gets to eat",which we already knew. OK? i don't know where they are going to go fromhere, but i am very, very upset.
