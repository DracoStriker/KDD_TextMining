Literally the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting, CGI, and wholemovie in general are cringe worthy. I'm a huge fan of Jeepers Creepers1 but this is just ridiculous. It looks like a couple college studentswith $20,000 budget made this movie. I waited years for part 3 to comeout, totally disappointing.
