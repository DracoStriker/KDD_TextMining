If you are a fan of the previous Jeeper Creeper movies, do your self afavor and stay away from this film. As someone who would rate the first2 films as 9/10, this film just suck to be frank, it was so bad Icouldn't even finish it. It fails on all ends, poor acting, horrible plot and outrageousChoreography, it was an utter disappointment to what was an amazingstory. This marks the official death or the franchise, or the start toa line of poor low budget films.
