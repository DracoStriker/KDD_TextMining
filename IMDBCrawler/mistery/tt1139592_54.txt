I was so excited when I saw the film was coming out. I actually enjoyedJC1 and 2. I've watched both a few times and even though 2 was a bitcrap, I got into the spirit of the film.My husband and I sat down, elated we're finally getting to see it, andwithin the first 3 minutes we were like hmm when is this suppose to be?After the first one? We thought that couldn't be right since there wasalready a JC2? The more we watched, the more confused we got as to whenthis was suppose to fit in to some time line. IT NEVER DID!!! It was anutter disappointment. My husband said lets pretend they didn't do a JC3 and forget about the series. He's right, such a pity.They could have take this into something so fantastic but they blew itbig time!
