Having been a huge fan of JC 1 AND 2 i was sadly disappointed with thisthird installment.First of all,the monster has lost his creepiness.Ishould give the movie no stars just for that mistake alone. He is ,asothers have said,too human.There was nothing human about him in thefirst two movies.The kill scenes are completely left out....instead ofleaving the monster mysterious,they leave the kill scenes out! Myfavorite of the three movies is the second one because of all the goryand creative kill scenes. This installment is a continuation of thefirst movie,which i thought would be interesting but there were toomany sub plots..none of them interesting.I never cared about any of thecharacters.I hate a movie that drags out sub plots.Again i have to saymy biggest complaint is the monster himself.....why did they make himseem like a human serial killer? Why did they drag out the sub plotsinstead of setting up an interesting movie from the beginning? I shutthe movie off three quarters of the way through..i didn't care to seethe ending.
