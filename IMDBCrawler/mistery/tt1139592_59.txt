Well just got home from seeing the movie tonight. Thought the movie wasbetter than I thought it was going to be. All the moments that thecreeper was on the screen was great. The acting could have been betterby the characters. The new more developed character in this movie wasthe truck. Won't spoil it for anyone, but the truck has a few new movesthis time. Really as creepy, and surprising as the creeper himself. Yeswe also finally get to see Trish a little bit. This movie starts at theend of the first movie and ends at the beginning of the second. You canseamlessly watch the 1st one - the 3rd one - then the 2ndchronologically. One problem with the movie is they seem to figure outwhere the creeper came from ( quote from movie ) he is ancient. Thenthey don't tell you?
