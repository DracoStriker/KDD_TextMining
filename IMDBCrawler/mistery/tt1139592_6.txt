I have been waiting for too long and can't express how disappointed iam now! The Creeper wearing a red shirt? Really? New cleaner face withsome fancy weapons and 2000s techniques on his truck? This is more likea comedy movie, or to be fair, a love story! Both writer and producershould go bury themselves!
