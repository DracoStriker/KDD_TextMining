I loved the first, liked the second and hated the third. I was waitingfor it but it was a trash. It basically has nothing to do with thefirst 2 films except that it looks kinda similar to the creature fromthose. Man.. They touched the hand and said they see what the creature is andthey know it's secrets and stuff, that made an interesting part I waswaiting for the explanation and nothing happened. They got an old truck that has all kind of extras and even from it'stires the bullets and bouncing BACK (not just off) :D A huge spear is in the guy's leg and what the f... They just movedaround the field like that. It was comical. Not a horror. It literally looked like a FANMADECOMEDY.Gave it 3 because I was curious enough to watch it till the end..
