There will be spoilers but still it's not even worth watching thismovie. After 14 years since the last movie, witch a lot of peoplethought was s$%t, I kind of liked it, it was far from good and far fromthe first one but still very enjoyable. But oh my god does this onecrap all over it. What surprises me is that it's the original directorwho promised us a backstory and a final explanation for the Creeper.Yeah you won't get it. You'll be teased till the end and nothing willbe explained. You'll get a cameo at the end and a pretty cheesy one andreally cringe worthy. My god and the visuals the damn CGI, it lookedfar better in 2001. Just look at the gap 2001-2017. Imagine that let itsink in. And they ruined the main antagonist by giving him a newstylish red shirt...what? I can get past that if he was frighteninghere or at least intimidating, but I didn't flinch. Use of pointlessCGI, where you can use practical effects is just laughable. I mean ifit was good CGI i can get over it but this looks like TV seriesquality. Some TV shows have much better visual effects...actually a lotof them. The acting...just...some is good but...just I can't even. Andget the best part...the story takes place between the first two movies.Am not joking. What a twist -_-... Some shots are just plain good,nothing more, just average and music is also that average but witheverything else and the lies about what we were gonna get it can't gohigher then 1/10. It doesn't deserve a higher score, just a shame.
