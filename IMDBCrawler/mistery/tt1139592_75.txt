I really enjoy these movies, they have creeped me out in the past. Ifelt the creeper was a fresh new look on a horror film villain. I wasreally looking forward to this movie but I was very, very disappointed.I seriously thought this was a made for TV movie with the awful cutscenes and editing. The story was weak and did't make much sense. Iwish they would have kept it true to the story line.
