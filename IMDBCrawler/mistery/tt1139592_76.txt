This movie is terrible. The first two films were decent but JC3 justdoes not compare at all. The movie is confusing because it makes nosense. I actually googled the movie while watching to see if I hadmissed something. JC fans wanted a prequel (origins story) or a storybeyond the second film but instead it takes place between 1 and 2. Idon't understand the decision to make JC3 the way it was made. It'salmost as if they wanted to create a horrible movie. Even if you likedthe first two movies, you're not missing much by never watching thismovie.
