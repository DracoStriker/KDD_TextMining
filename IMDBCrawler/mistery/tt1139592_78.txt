I liked the first JC, and I loved the second one, and I've been waitingfor a continuation ever since.And they release this joke of a movie?I am flabbergasted. I haven't seen anything like it. The productionvalue of this garbage is through the floor. The editing, the cutting,the effects.. the continuity.. even the worst of the worst B horrormovies are better than this. I'm not even going to try to describe theawfulness, I wouldn't know where to start.How was this allowed? Who spent money on this?They don't even let the actors finish their sentences before cuttingabruptly to the next scene. Didn't anyone watch the finished moviebefore sending it off to the DVD pressing? Why didn't anyone say "Stop!We can't do this! It's utter crap!" ?Most of the blame should be placed on the director. But there were somany other people involved in making this movie. Someone should havespoken up.The only good thing about this movie is that it apparently happensbetween the first and the second one (and which year is that, exactly?)so there's still the chance to create a real JC3 by continuing from thesecond one. But please get a new director. I am not really devastated. I was happy and excited for a third JC, butI've been disappointed so much lately that I wasn't really expecting toblown away.So now I'm just ... surprised. What the heck did I just watch?
