It is not easy to make a horror three-quel. Harder if it's a cult filmarriving 17 years into the lifespan of a franchise. Adding to that thedirector's controversy, it was really difficult to make this film allthat it could have been.Jeepers Creepers 3 is not lacking in good cinematography especiallygiven the film's budget. The natural greens pop next to Southern styleestates and farmhouses. One scene taking place at dawn with pink skiesand a dark looming tree are ominous... A grief-afflicted mother ispreparing for the coming of a monster. The mood is rich and dense asany scene from one of the better two films.CGI is a disappointment. The film struggles in making the Creeper'sflight and dart actions look realistic. Not a complete failure liketalk around the film's effects make it seem, but passable by anymeasure.The most egregious failure throughout the limited scope of productionis the film's low fear factor. Far too little is threatening ordeliriously creepy in the way the first two films achieved. I can'tpinpoint the worst culprit for it. I am near certain that it hassomething to do with the film's budget.
