This movie is just HORRIBLE. I mean, its not like the first two entriesin this trilogy were anything amazing, but this, this is just an almostunwatchable steaming pile of dog sh**. ***Spoiler alert*** afteropening with an incredibly retarded scene with horribly CGI generatedbody parts falling from the sky, this movie just gets worse and worse,and it is very obvious that this was a made for TV movie. The acting isterrible, the story is plodding and dumb, and has an ending thatdoesn't really resolve anything. And ***spoiler alert*** if you canmake it to the very end of this sh** fest and hope that it will be thelast movie, you'll sadly be treated to the sister from the first movietalking and saying "you killed my brother. Now come get me you s.o.b",which unfortunately means there will probably be a fourth movie.
