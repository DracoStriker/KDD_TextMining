This movie is not what was promised; It's not 23 years after the firstfilm nor can you expect your favorite returning actors. The only one Irecognized was Brandon Smith's policeman character Sgt. Davis Tubbsfrom the first movie. Gina Philips character Trish shows up at the veryend to drop a line that sets up future films.Jonathan Breck does reprise his role as the Creeper, but I had to checkIMDb to make sure it was him - The makeup didn't look like the originalCreeper. It was more generic. I was incredibly disappointed. This wasan editing hack job, chopped full of fillers. There were disjointedcharacters and what I thought was improved dialogue. You can blame itall on production and the lazy direction of Victor Salva.JC3 attempts to bridge a gap between the first movie to the 2nd film,but fails miserably. Near the end the character Buddy leaves on thesame school bus from Part 2. Don't bother checking - He wasn't in JC2.There really wasn't any point in connecting the two movies, because wealready knew they were connected.They introduce new characters that (evidently) had a connection to theCreeper the 23 years before Trish & Darry arrived. I didn't see anypoint in this. They didn't add anything to the mythology other thanstate "We know what the Creeper is" - but they don't bother telling theaudience. All we really discover is that the Creeper has crowsfollowing him around.A lot of attention was focused on the "BEATNGU" truck, providing acloseup of something that (sure) is pretty cool, but specifically Iknew they did this for time & budget restraints. The truck hassentience and can drive itself. It's also impervious to bullets ...even the tires & windows.
