SpoilersThis film feels like an long introduction for another movie. As a standalone it offers little, the film doesn't add to mythology in any way.The characters even tease "we know what you are", then don't add anynew information about the creeper. So what do we know? We know he has a pimped out van, that seems to havea mind of its own. This van is kinda funny, it even spikes its owner.It would seem more fitting for an evil Inspector Gadget then asupernatural entity. Jeepers Creepers shouldn't be funny or gimmicky,the first film was creepy. It was a chase movie, if the creeper wantedyou then you were already dead. The Jeepers song (noticeably absent)should fill you with dread. Was the song too expensive? That moneywasn't spent on CGI or on a good script clearly. It's disappointingthat this film was clearly rushed because i have looked forward to thismovie for years
