I'm a huge horror movies fan. I've been waiting 14 years too see a newJeepers creepers Film so I finally saw Jeepers creepers 3... To behonest watching this new movie I was expecting to see the return ofTrish Jenner but that did not really happen only the last 2 mins of themovie. that was a major let down for me. Let me start by talking about the bad things. This movie had some goodparts in it and it did scare me in a few scenes but the movie had a badScript. The director said this was going to be the most frighteningJeepers Creepers Film well hate to say it but it's not. It's not verycreepy it's not very bloody it's not very entertaining it's not one ofthose movies like Halloween. It's pretty much boring. This movie isdefinitely not the best Jeepers creepers Film. The first 2 films weregreat this movie is such a major major let down . It was a hugedisappointment and a waste of time and money seeing it. I think Ishould get a refund for this trash.. there's not much i like about thismovie. I'm not gonna say this is the worst movie in the world becauseisn't...The good things I like about this movie ...The creeper had more kills and he had more scenes plus his truck waskind of magical but very fakeish. That's about it. Again I'm not gonna lie I was really expecting a better film a betterscript' better actors plus bring back original actors that did not havea 2_3 min role in the film. I was expecting too see the creepersorigins but that did not really happen hopefully Jeepers creepers 4will be better and hopefully we don't have to wait another 14 years tooget another film. Overall again a major let down very very disappointed not worth the 14year Wait the movie did scare me a few times but nothing reallyexciting' not worth my time to watch it again. I only gave this movie 3stars out of 10......
