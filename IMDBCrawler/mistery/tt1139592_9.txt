Nothing to write home about. Entertaining, but fell far short of whatit had the potential of being. A few new gags here and there, butnothing enlightening, Ties the two previous movies together well, butthat is about as far as it goes. The story was predictable, and doesn'tanswer any questions the viewer may have from the 1st two films. Iwanted more backstory, as did the rest of the people in the audience,but no explanation of the Creepers origins are even hinted at. If thisfranchise is going to continue it might be a good idea to give somehistory, and fill in a few blanks about what the creeper actually is.There were some good moments in the film that looked as though thingswere going to be cleared up, but in the end stayed the course and leftus wanting more... anything more than watching the little hair piecestay glued to the top of Brandon Smiths' head while we try to get pastthe who, what, when, and why of the creeper. Not my favorite of thethree to say the least. I left the theater with a lot of disappointedpeople. We all arrived early, and sat chatting about how excited wewere to finally see part 3, and agreed that if there is a part 4 afterthis we would all wait for a review before buying a ticket for a onenight only special event showing that wasn't worth the price ofadmission. It had such potential... but didn't deliver.
