Those that have seen the rest of the series know that one of the majorhooks, is that the "creeper" is a rather mysterious character in thehorror film genre. In the first two films, all we really know is thatevery 23rd spring it gets to eat for 23 days, and that it eats torestore it's body.Enter the third film. The allure of this film, is that supposedly afterall these years, light will be shed on the creature. There's a part inthe film, where they hold the former hand of "the creeper", which givesthe person a vision of it's past, and what it is. However, NONE of thisis shared with the audience! IMHO it's a BIG @#$% you to its patrons.Without a doubt, this is nothing more then a ploy to revive a long deadseries due to the lack of creativity in movie producers these days, andstring along those enjoyed the franchise milking them of their money.The portrayal of the main antagonist is so far off the mark from therest of the series. Supposedly, the third film takes placechronologically between the first and second film. Odd part is, thatelements of the film are so far outside of scope of the picture theseries paints. It treats the character almost like an evil good humorice cream truck driver.The end of the film alludes to one of the characters being on the bus,the main setting, of the second film. Problem is, that if you link onefilm to another, the character needs to have some idea of what's goingon, in order of sequence. That's just terrible storytelling.I for one will not continue to waste time and energy on subsequentfilms of this franchise, if such horrendous methods are to beconsidered part of the new norm.
