Pulling your own teeth out with a dead rats body. This Movie Gave MeCancer.I was expecting something better than visual aids, not the kind thathelps you see, actual HIV for the eyes.My life is now less magical for spending a hour and a bit watchingthis.I could have had more fun cleaning out my belly button with a steelbrush that had previously been used on a sewage line.In case you don't get what I am saying - do NOT watch this movie, evenas a joke, because no one will laugh, and you will just want toquestion all your life choices, that lead you to this moment.Also, Justin Long is not in this, and he's cool.MINUS FIVE STARS.
