How did it come to this? Are they serious? Is this a syfy production?What's with the effects? Was logic also abducted by the creeper anddropped somewhere in a corn field or something?What a letdown! Man oh man! JC1 is one of the best horrors out there.So much tension. Suspense. Build up. Real, genuine scares, not cheapjump scenes! And don't get me started on the Creeper! Also, the cast ofthe first film does an amazing job. Just unbelievable!And we skip part 2 in order to reach the 3rd one faster: cartooncharacters that do nothing more than die. Horrible special effects,complete lack of belief in the monster and let's not forget the new addon to the series: booby traps! All over! As many as possible! And ofcourse the Creeper itself gets these new uber powers, him and his truckalso. He becomes something like Hulk in an Iron man suit I think. Overall, if you are a die hard fan of the series, you'll watch this nomatter what. It feels like after Alien 1 and 2, they throw in Alien 3.And they expect you to like it as well. Just go with it..All in all, a fourth movie is in talks. It looks like they chose toreturn to form. Problem is this one did so bad, I'm pretty sure thehype will die out. Even finance should be a problem. They can't use thesame camera work they did in this one. It's a disaster. And so many cutscenes it feels like the job is just not finished yet. Seems more likea sneak preview. Now you've been warned. It is as bad as they say it is.Cheers!
