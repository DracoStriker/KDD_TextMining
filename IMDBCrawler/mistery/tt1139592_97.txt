The whole movie was cheesy and very badly made, the action scenes put 0time into, we are suppose to learn about The Creeper's past from thepsychic but we don't even get to see that, the movie was very lowbudget, I loved the first movie, 2nd movie was OK could have beenbetter, this movie ruined everything, spoilers for the ending, the onlygood thing about the movie was Trish Jenner (Gina Philips) showing upagain but for like 5 seconds =(
