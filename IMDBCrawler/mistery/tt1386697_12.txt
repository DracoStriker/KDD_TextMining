Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on thehype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great conceptthat we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For somereason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the numberone problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such incoherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent indeveloping these characters for their introduction to the big stage.Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at somepoints. But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and agreat villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn'tmake sense because the movie itself went in so many directions thatnone of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a totalfailure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls soflat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster. This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority ofthe casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis,Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. Ireally think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast wouldbe Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of RickFlag was out of touch of what that character should be and forEnchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should havebeen chosen over Cara Delevingne. The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better moviethan Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. Aweak six stars and a onetime watch.
