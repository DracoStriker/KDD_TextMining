The whole plot of the movie was a mess. It really confused me what allthe characters in the film was fighting for, I mean there was no realgoal of the movie for the first 70% of the time. Then they set up thestory in a way where the friend turns into the foe, and those friendsare now facing this foe as their primary enemy and not the one it wasshown at the beginning of the movie. I think the whole script waswritten by a total non professional guy who needs to again go throughthe basic levels of a film school. This movie made DC lose its fametowards its fans and I hope they bounce back in their next show. Thankyou
