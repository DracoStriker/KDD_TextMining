OK.So I'm a senior.But I've seen lots of Marvel/DC Comics movies. Ireally liked Ant Man last year because there was a story to it.SuicideSquad was filmed in my home town, Toronto.There was so much hype.Buteven my grown son hated it when we saw it.There's no characterdevelopment. We wasted our money.Don't go to this disaster. You'llregret it no matter your age.During each scene, I was wondering what ishappening.Because the lighting was so dark,I couldn't make out theaction. There were times I kept asking myself why I had agreed to cometo this film. The character,Harley Quinn, had this Brooklyn accentwhich didn't really fit in. The joker was a joke,not even scary orcomical.This was the worst movie I have seen this year.
