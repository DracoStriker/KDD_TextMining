Flat jokes, one-liners and terrible chemistry make up this movie. Asusual, we see a group of heroes taking on a legion of mindlessalien/zombie/no-named soldiers who have absolutely no chance. There areso many awkward moments in this movie. You don't have to see the movieto know how it will play out and end. The bad guy is lame anduninteresting, who apparently has the power to instantly disarm all ofthe heroes but doesn't use it until the very end -- when it's too late.I get that they want to show us that she is "powerful", but they justdon't know what they are doing. Just terrible.Save your time and money. There are few memorable things about thismovie.
