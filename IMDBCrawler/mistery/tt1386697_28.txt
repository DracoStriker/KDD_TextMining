First of all I want to explain my 1 star rating: this star is not foryou, it's not for IMDb, it's not even for the movie. It's for WillSmith, and Will Smith alone. I'm not crazy about Smith or nothing, butI think he made me to sit and watch it till the end. I walked frommovies after 30 minutes of Batman V Superman, or let's be realistichere: Man of Steel 2. So, now let's talk about this movie, and I'll tryto be profane as little as possible! This movie is bad. And I meanvery, VERY bad! I know that DC and Marvel are great foes in terms ofcompetition among two big companies, and every super hero always getsanswered by another super hero from the other company and that's oldnews. What I cannot stand is taking obvious details from competition'sfilms and introducing them in their own movies as something "new" or"out of the ordinary meant to be funny" case in point: UNICORN fromDeadPool now in possession of "Boomerang- guy(?)". OK, that's justannoying and cheap, but let's talk about story line: If you EVER seenANY action movie EVER before, you'll hate this movie. Anyone rememberNick Cage movie "Con Air"? Come on people, it's the same freaking storywith some CGI SF elements added to nobody's pleasure!!!! But even ifthey did a "remake" of "Con Air" they could've made those villains bemore villain! Steve Buscemi's scene in a pool singing "He's got wholeworld in his hands" is more powerful than every scene with Joker and/orHarley! Even Danny Trejo did better than every actor in this movie! Atleast he's believable. In SS not even 1 character is believable orconsistent with his character. At one point in the movie it's totallythe same who says what it all starts to sound the same. It's like theyall became 1 character saying meaningless one-liners that serve nopurpose whatsoever. I honestly think Batman:Arkham (Assylum, Origins,City etc.)games did better justice to the franchise than every DC movieafter Batman The Dark Knight.
