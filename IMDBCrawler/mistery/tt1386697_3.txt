I am really really disappointed to be honest. I was waiting for thismovie for so long, I loved Suicide Squad in Assault on Arkham and I wasso happy when the news arrived about the live action movie. And as amassive Jared Leto fan I was extremely happy they chose him for therole of my all time favorite character, Joker. So I was hyped to seehim, but the whole gang too. And what I got from the movie was equalwith pure sadness. I mean, Jared was in it for a total 10 minutes andhis role could have been easily left out, I only knew the charactersbecause I read the comics and watched the wonderful animation (which bythe way a 100 times better), the story telling was HORRIBLE, the actorscould have been wonderful but they kinda lost in the terrible script.Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were fantastic but we didn'treally get to know them... and the other characters were only therefor... who know why? WHY DC, WHY? This story had so much promise andyou ruined it... You should have adopted the Assault on Arkham into alive action movie... All these characters would needed a stand alonemovie, and once we've got to know them then put them together... sureit would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on,that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing! I am so, so sadright now... All of the actors deserve way better than this and theyall have great potential
