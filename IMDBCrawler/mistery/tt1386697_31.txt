Sloppy scene structure doesn't make good movies. Unconventionalcharacters alone don't make good movies. Bad directing, bad editing,bad CGI, bad acting. If a film fails on every aspect but still is byall means successful, what does that say about it's audience. Lets stopmaking terrible movies. One-liner, one-dimensional characters with nodepth beyond the label of "bad", "evil", "crazy" fill this movie, as asurprisingly congested script attempts to give them backstory. Althoughcomedy is very subjective, jokes in addition to the majority of thedialogue in general is very cringe-worthy. I felt embarrassed wheneveranyone spoke. It all make me want to commit suicide squad.
