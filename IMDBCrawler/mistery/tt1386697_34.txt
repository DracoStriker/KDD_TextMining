I guess I'm one of those people whose first review in this site is notout of love, but out of hate. I confess: I was appalled by this movieand everything it entailed. And I'm here to rant.If somebody asks me in the next few days (until I can shrug the rantoff): "What's wrong with the world?" I'm going to say "That movie,Suicide Squad". The very thought that this movie exists, a truckload of money investedin it, and people going "wow awesome!" is what's wrong with the world.I guess that's what happens when everything and anything around youtoday operates as some kind of "upper". And this movie is yet anotherbox of uppers: every element that goes into the art of cinema - sound(echo that laughter), music (shuffle: on), editing (don't stop time ismoney gogogo!), character development ("that's slipknot, man who canclimb anything"), plot (belly-dancer who wants to destroy the worldwith an army of people turned into goo ***SPOILER ALERT*** is defeatedby BAD BUT SOPHISTICATED people), cinematography (MAGIC TENTACLES!KABOOM!!) - each act as some sort of stimulant to get you "up" on yourseat, with the obligatory trivialized sexuality thrown in ("wow thatwoman is a stunner, and she's crazy!"), for a full 2 hours. For theyoung and eager it can result in a trip (a bad one that you'll regretlater), for others who've been there it's likely to bring you downinstead. I guess back in the day I did have a more tolerant approach like "meh,it is what it is." Or maybe I was somewhere between that and "this isBS". Now I'm firmly at "this is BS and I want my 2 hours back". And youknow what... Even BS used to have some dignity, and integrity. To end this on a less rantish note. Do yourself a favor and watch"Assault on Arkham" instead. Or play one of those Batman video games(or watch a "game movie" version of it on youtube)... Or maybe stare ata wall and think about things... Oh well, there goes the less rantishnote.
