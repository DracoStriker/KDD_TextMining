There could be some spoilers, but I will keep them to a minimum.The movie premiered in my country and I got to see it. I give it a7/10.What bothered me: - Not much big villain character development for usto care at all. Couldn't understand who the hell is the enchantress'brother and his connection to her, and they barely appeared in like 1/4of the movie, didn't care much about them. - Not enough focus on thespecial abilities of each member of the squad and what makes themspecial and different from each other. - Not enough Joker presence, butI understand he wasn't supposed to be over-present in the movie.Joker was great for me and Harley Quinn is the best in the movie. ViolaDavis (Waller) and Will Smith delivered outstanding performances.
