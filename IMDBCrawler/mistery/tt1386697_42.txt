She summons the hit-manDeadshot (Will Smith); The Joker's girlfriend and former psychiatristHarley Quinn (Margot Robbie); the pyrokinetic Diablo (Jay Hernandez);the bank thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney); the mutant Killer Croc(Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); the criminal Slipknot (Adam Beach); and thewitch Enchantress that possessed the former archaeologist June Moone(Cara Delevingne) to form The Task Force X. Waller also assigns thecommand of the team to Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), who is inlove with June. To convince the group to obey orders, a nano bomb isimplanted in the neck of each member. When Enchantress releases herpowerful brother and they besiege Midway City turning the residentsinto an army of monsters and building a powerful weapon. Meanwhile TheJoker (Jared Leto) is plotting a plan to rescue his beloved HarleyQuinn."Suicide Squad" is a deceptive film with a lame story and terribledirector that waste a magnificent cast. Margot Robbie steals the showand Jared Leto makes a creepy The Joker, but it is not enough to savethis film. Waller killing her own team is not dark, but awful. The CGIis poor and the best is the music score with classic rock. My vote isfive.Title (Brazil): "Esquadrão Suicida" ("Suicide Squad")
