Dead shot is one of the greatest batman villains of all time. Thismovie turned him into a pimp with a heart. That hat, are you kidding.Why ruin an established villain? Create a new wise cracking hip hopvillain. Pathetic. Will Smith, why? I thought America was done withthat embarrassment and his family.Harlequin is pretty good. Don't know if Leto was a good joker, he washardly in it.Killer croc looked good and that's all.All the other villains were forgettable.Fighting scenes were terrible, it was like they were fighting on astage.Enchantress animation was so bad it was... Uncomfortable... Spelldancing? Really?The movie was just so poorly planned out, it fell flat at every turn.WB please watch a marvel movie.There are people that write comics for a living, use them! They workcheap.
