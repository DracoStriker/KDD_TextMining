a fan made comic book movie ...please don't try to insult people whoread comic books. And yess i read DC and Marvel and every other comicthat is out there...and trust me this movie has nothing to do withcomics except te characters. It is simply as the critics say a terriblemovie....i watch the movie til the moment they went in the bar to havea drink and have a thee time!!! I tought i need a drink myself andwalked out of the cinema...again this movie is terrible even for comicsen dc fans!!the characters were not funny at all there wasnot even onemoment in the movie that i tought this is the turning point it was likewatching a bad edited movie..done by a high school kids who did hisfinal exam in film making and use the standard bad/good guy formula anddc owed him something like 175 mil dollar
