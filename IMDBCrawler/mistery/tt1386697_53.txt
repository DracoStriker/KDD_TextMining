First off, this can't be looked at in comparison to The Dark Knightbecause these are two very different stories in the Gotham Universe.People going into this with that mindset might be disappointed. I knowthis was more based off the 2011 Suicide Squad comics which I don'tmind. I found it odd Deadshot got the spotlight as more of a "maincharacter" type. It was something I could dislike easily because she'susually quiet and menacing in the background. Will Smith ended upplaying a great Deadshot. As much as I love Harley, Joker steals theshow. I love the classic cartoon Joker and he played it brilliantly.There's some good character development and the writing was more funnythan I expected but DC is just so dark all the time I felt like itenhanced it. It's funny but in a dark twisted way in the comics. If Ihad to say some negatives... I don't like the shaky-cam action fightthat are way too zoomed in to see anything. It was tolerable and therewere some great action movie moments. However because they hadcharacter development, it allows the audience to care more about thefights/action. You can have a good character piece with bad actioncause at least you care about what's going on. Bad writing or badcharacter presentation with great action will not get the crowd to havea reaction. But I wouldn't go as far as calling it bad. However theediting was terrible. I heard they took this movie into a focus groupwho knew nothing about movies or proper story structure for that matterand let them dictate what happened to it. David Ayer did a great job,don't ruin his work through editing. I'm reviewing this based off whatI saw in his original idea. The movie would get a 9 if they didn'tchange it.I can't really judge it on a typical movie goer scale because I go tosee the comic book movies for a reason. When they get it right, it'sgold. I don't mind a few changes if they positively affect the overalloutcome. This movie succeeded with that. I'd highly recommend to comicfans.
