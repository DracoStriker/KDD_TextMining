I am a huge DC fan, and was eager to see the film when I first caughtwind that 'Suicide Squad' was in the making. Though having manyexpectations, hopes, etc, I walked into the theater with a blank slate- I wanted to judge this film based on the film alone, withoutcomparison to any other sources. The film has a quality soundtrack, and Will Smith and Margot Robbie'scharacters fill the screen with their amazing acting and portrayals ofthese quirky villains, and though slightly overused, the kaleidoscopeeffect in the end credits was pretty cool... But I think most of thefilm's budget went into that rather than the post-production editingteam's paycheck. The editing was okay, but it muddled up the time lapse within the film.Though "3 days" had passed, it had felt as though the whole film hadhappened within a single night. It was messy, and the CGI with CaraDelevigne's character felt a little mediocre. Suicide Squad had potential, and if the producer(s) had made theirminds up rather than creating two 'separate' films and awkwardlycombining them both together, it could have truly been a great film.The pomp and flash of the design and humor caters to a wider audience,and it's no secret why Suicide Squad is doing so well financially. Butthe truth is, though it has some great characters and awesome music,it's not well edited and it's not a brilliant film. It tried to bring in the humor and kick of Deadpool with thewhimsicality of Guardians of the Galaxy, and I feel that if DC tried tobe DC, and stopped trying to compete and out-do Marvel, it couldproduce something truly spectacular. We've seen the Dark Knight, weknow what DC can do, it's about time it brought that flare back andcreated something truly spectacular.
