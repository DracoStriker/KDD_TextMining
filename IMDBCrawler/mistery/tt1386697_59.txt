what a disappointment this movie was.i found it boring slow anduninteresting.i struggled to stay awake and debated leaving part waythrough.Margot Robbie was the best(and only)good thing in the wholemovie.there were quite a few good actors here,but nobody can save thisthing.and***minor spoiler coming right up***the Joker has very littlescreen time,which is a shame,because if the character had more screentime,it might have elevated the movie.as it is i wouldn't recommend themovie to anyone.but if you do decide to go see it,you might want to goin with low expectations.for me,Suicide Squad was a realdisappointment.i give Suicide Squad a 3/10.
