I was really looking forward to this movie and only ended up with ahuge deception. The script is messy and there are way too manycharacters that are too quickly introduced. Many of these "villains"would require a whole movie to give intensity to their character... Ireally feel like DC just wanted to have as big an audience as possiblewithout spending a penny on the script. Some good things are thespecial effects , the movie is overall very beautiful to watch. Somecharacters need a bravo for their wonderful roles: Harley Quinnmostly... The others are kind of empty to me. And some are very verybad like enchantress who mumbles in a foreign language all along andwhose only 3 lines in English SUCK (when she asks Flag to destroyenchantress instead of saving her blabla). The Joker doesn't have aplace in the movie, his role does not add anything to it and half ofhis lines are... awkward moans. El Diablo's behavior is predictablefrom the very beginning, Batman really wasn't necessary, Katana's fewlines are desperately cheesy, etc... As a conclusion, the viewer isunable to feel a link whatsoever to any of the characters since theirstories are disappointingly and quickly told. The acting of manycharacters does not help, whether they were just bad or the directorasked them to play in that un-subtle fashion. The script is disjoint,flashbacks don't add much quality or intensity to the movie, and the"big plot" revealed at the end is... not much of a secret since theviewer KNOWS enchantress escaped from the hands of Waller. I feel likethis is a big commercial move from DC to attract people... However,this will only disgust the people who were fans of the heroes/villainsin the beginning. Money over quality
