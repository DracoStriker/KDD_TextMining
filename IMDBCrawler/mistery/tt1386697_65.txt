I just want to say that these guys were supposed to play bad-assvillains, but honestly the villains from power girls are darker andwith a better humor than these clowns.Non of the other characters are worth the ticket (with one exceptionwhich I will mention at last) nor they seem interesting, Will Smithseems super generic and you don't buy it that he was a criminal. Therest of them are not even worth analyzing. Then you have the witch,which was the worst of the bad, seems to me that Cara is talent-lessfor acting, worst if it's suppose to be a obscure and ancient villain.The only reason for not giving a 1 out of 10 is Harley Quinn. Margot isinsanely hot! and she indeed seemed crazy as supposed to be for hercharacter, she definitely is the spark that lights up the movie.
