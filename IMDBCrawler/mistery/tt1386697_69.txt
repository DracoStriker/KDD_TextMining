A soppy movie, full of sentimental suffering, mourning and all thatpopular now emo-stuff. In some episodes it does work, anyhow (RickFlagg's relation with the Enchantress has poor chemistry, but the tear-jerking does save the day). In some episodes it just annoys (there is alittle hope for some better Harley-Joker sequences in the extended cut,but I'm speaking now only of the theatrical version).The film has many action scenes, not to say great, but definitelyproper ones. And there are some interesting personae, Cap'n Boomerangfor instance (though he is a petty copy of Dedpool, some unpleasantcharisma about him can be felt). And there are idiotic scenes with theJoker. If you came to see how Harley Quinn became his true attendant,you will not see it. She just falls in love with her psycho patient,because -- Well, because it was in the script. And so ends the story ofthe greatest love ever between two quirks: just not shown. As if therewas nothing to show.I can't say the movie is really bad (Margo Robby does all to turn itfrom a foolish, sentimental story into something more interesting, evenat the count of simple fan-service). This is just a movie to watch whenyou want rest and relax. Almost no sense, absolutely no idea,characters, as it were, are to be judged only by their outlooks. Turnoff your brain, just enjoy a nicely-made show.
