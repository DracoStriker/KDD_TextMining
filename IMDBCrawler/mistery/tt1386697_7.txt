Is this movie terrible? Absolutely notIs this movie great? Absolutely not.I always heard from people that they either HATED or LOVED this movie.And for me it was neither.The audience for this film is served with a classic action movie/comicbook. "The world is in danger! There must be a solution! Although thereare bumps between the characters along the way, eventually, we'll solvethe problem"The interesting twist is *supposed* to be that instead of classicsuperheroes, we have bad guys. To that I say "so what?". The moviedidn't really establish why I should care about much of what was goingon on screen?it was all just classic popcorn movie action and sequencesthat were occasionally broken up by half-attempts at characterdevelopment.
