I was pleasantly surprised with the movie overall despite poor reviews.Nice short backstory on characters that mattered and well acted for themost part. Critics try to over analyze action sci-fi flicks instead ofjust enjoying a well done film and letting the people judge themselves.You are not watching Gone with the Wind or The Shawshank Redemption.It's a movie based on comic book characters made for adolescent adultsto enjoy! Just be happy someone put this together and only hope for asequel! If I never saw the story between Harley and The Joker continueit would be a real shame! Also the Will Smith performance was not asbad as reported! This isn't a role for Tom Hanks or he would have beencast!
