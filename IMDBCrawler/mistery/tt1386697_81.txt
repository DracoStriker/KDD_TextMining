Don't know exactly how to sum this up except that Ayer along withSnyder are going to be the death of any decent DCMU series. Wait, theyare the death of the DCMU series. This one is worse than "Dawn OfJustice" (though I really liked that flick) in terms of pacing,direction, dialogue, characterization, and plot - what makes itdifferent is the total miscasting of everyone except Marogot Robbie,who would be awesome if they made her less-sexualized and not whitetrash ICP looking. The only thing that was enjoyable was seeing Batman.Just a shame these rouges are one-dimensional juggalos he has to cleanup after.
