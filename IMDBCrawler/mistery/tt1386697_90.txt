I think a lot of people expected this movie to be a lot different thanwhat it actually was and expected a lot more "Action" or to see the"superheroes" as the villains. As a true DC Comic Fan Girl I have tosay that the movie followed the comic, the characters were portrayed asthey were in the comic and considering that mesh of the actors thismovie is a great watch. I didn't get sucked into the movie, but thatdoesn't mean it wasn't a good movie. The effects were a bit cheesy in acouple parts but the overall acting quality was good, the story linewas a "love story" at the heart and I do feel that the ending was notwhat the viewers wanted by any means, since the woman isn't killed butas I stated before it does follow the ending of the comic. Personally,if you're a DC Comic fan then no matter what this movie is a greatwatch, if you're looking for Action and the "superhero" feel then youneed to watch Captain America or if you're looking for more of acomedic movie then check out Deadpool but compared to those two SuicideSquad is a 6/10 but compared to the comic and viewing experience its a9/10.
