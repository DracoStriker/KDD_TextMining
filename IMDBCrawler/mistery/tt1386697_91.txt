It's about 8.5 worth of a movie in my book, for some real good actingand well written roles. That is, some well written roles, had it beentrue with all the characters in this movie, this would've been a realmasterpiece, but all too often it did fall short of the qualityperformance of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Joel Kinnaman. there are afew other solid performances which didn't get their charactersdeveloped enough to shine like these three, especially Viola Daviswho's very good as the perfect government agent that sees nothing butgetting their job done, but truth is her role is too one dimensional,and there was room for real depth here. Same is true with Jai Courtneyand Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Jared Leto, isn't bad in his role, butit's hardly a role to speak about, and he was hyped from here toforever, so it was a letdown. But the roles that were properly writtenwere really superb and the three actors I mentioned did them greatjustice. This together with a reasonable plot and solid technicalaspects of this production, make it a worth your while movie. But onceagain this could've been a lot better, and the fact it's not is plainshame.
