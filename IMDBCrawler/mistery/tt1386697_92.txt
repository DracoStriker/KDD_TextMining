Overall, I liked it a lot. For reference, I like Marvel and DC equally,and I loved BvS (and anything with Batman).The visuals were amazing, the characters were fun (although, I agreeunder developed), good use of music, and the fight scenes were cool.However, it was not without faults. Warner took some heat due to therun time of BvS, but the Extended Blu Ray was much better. I say, makethe movie as long as it needs to be. I can deal with a 3-hour SavingPrivate Ryan. Also, the sub-villains, the mindless enemies they fought,just felt like they were there for target practice. They reminded me ofthe droids in Star Wars Episode 1. Also, I thought Leto's Joker was attimes a copy of Heath. He even sounded like him a few times. I was notimpressed. I've heard, however, many of his footage was cut, so I lookforward to the Blu Ray. Great movie, go see it!
