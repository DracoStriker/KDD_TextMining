What persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon itby the stories original creator, Stephen King, who claimed: "I wasn'tprepared for how good it really was".He's not wrong."IT" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle buteffective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not onlydo the original title proud, they make this re-imagining of theoriginal classic even better than its predecessor. It's a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the filmsticks to the original's tricks; it isn't filled with loud in-your-facejump scares, in fact, a lot of what makes this film scary is the slickcinematography and intricate shadow play. The use of lighting andcreation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense, which is whyit's perfectly suited for those who like Horror movies but without theobnoxious gore.Watched the pre-release as a critic - August 28th.
