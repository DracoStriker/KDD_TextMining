Having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer, Ididn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema thisevening. Someone described the movie as 'The Goonies' meets 'ANightmare on Elm Street' - this turned out to be an extremely accuratedescription!The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark,yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercutby comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works.My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselvesgasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughinghysterically at the banter between the main characters.I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I thinkeven those individuals would find themselves enjoying 'It'. If not forthe horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It's as ifthis is a movie within a movie: a mix of ahigh-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror. A brillianttwo-for-one if you ask me!Great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing makethis movie a must watch!
