I'm a huge fan of the 1990's TV film of "It", especially for itsaesthetics and soundtrack, but it left out a lot of content from theoriginal novel, leaving me confused when I first saw it at the age of12. This remake, or perhaps actually a "re-adaptation", is certainlyvery timely, what with "Stranger Things" becoming so huge withpretentious hipsters everywhere. I'm still not sure it hits the "scary"factor very well, especially without Tim Curry's tremendous acting, butit's certainly creepy. It's not nostalgic though, nor does it retainmuch of the original novel, including the 50's setting, changed to the80's to obviously market itself with "Stranger Things" and "TheGoonies".My problem with this new adaptation of "It" is that it's addled withCGI and jump scares, neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal. Atthe risk of sounding like a film snob, if you're trying to make a filmset decades before this era, you don't use CGI at all if you can avoidit, unless you really know how to camouflage it. The constant profanitydid nothing for the story either, it only gave the false illusion ofbeing "intense". The sheer level of nerdiness made me cringe, unlikethe TV movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of loveand joy amidst the horror, just like King's novel.This film isn't completely terrible. It passes the time, but the onlything it has going for it is that the director thinks he has hit some80's vibe gold mine when in reality it just looked like a bad videogame full of childish jump scares.
