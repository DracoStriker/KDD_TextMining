The opening scene is good. From there on...not as much.I guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book muchmore than those who are. That being said, I don't think it is possibleto make a satisfying adaption of "It" without doing it the Game ofThrones way. More time is needed to dwell on each of the novel's partsto create the feel the book gave us. To tell the story as it was toldon paper. So I guess I'll forgive the filmmakers for that.The kids are okay. They've managed to portray the losers and therelationship between them decently enough- considering the runningtime. Again: more time is needed for better development. Much of whatactually happened between the kids and It has been cut, but again -running time. They had to.That they've changed the setting from the 1958 to the 80s was a badchoice, and so are the other changes. They're creating scenes thataren't in the book. They're changing things that are there. The biggestproblem I have with the film is the execution of the horror. Constantjump scares, way too much CGI, and a complete lack of understanding ofthe fact that less is more. Waiting for a scare is the scary part ofhorror, and this movie just throws everything at you constantly. Itjust isn't terrifying. At all.I didn't find myself bored, though. Besides the poor performance whenit came to being scary, it is an okay movie. It just isn't a goodadaptation.
