The first sequence is classical example of US horror film. In which,the evil clown suddenly and naturally appears, and it victimizes thekid who drops his toys into drainage passage on a rainy day in thelocal city of US. We not only easily grab the setting of the evil clownand what he wants. It is a typical bogie man story who eats and kidnapkids who are afraid of it. It(2017) proves effective use of VFX, CG animation is to crate whattraditional acting or camera working or editing technique can notachieve. This film actually avoided overused VFX and CG animations (CGis not an editorial work but it's computer animation). Moreover, it recovered or tried to revive the core spirit of 1980s'Goonies or Stand By Me to the certain extent. This is also wellaccepted and understandable. The evil clown is typical Boogieman, and it has common feature withFreddy. And it is scarier than the latter. I appreciate the legitimate and efficient structure of this film. It isthe best horror film of 2017! 10 out of 10!
