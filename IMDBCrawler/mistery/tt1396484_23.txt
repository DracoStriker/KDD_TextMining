This movie is horrible. And not in the "It's a good horror movie" senseeither. There is no coherent story to be seen here, no pacing, noexposition. There is literally *no* character development.How am I supposed to care for characters that I never get to know? Ididn't care what happened to them. The black kid, the fat kid and thegirl just kinda join the group. There is no development of thefriendship or any kind of emotional bond. *boom* and they're friends. There is no story. It's one jump scare after another interlaced with a"story". I put that in quotes because after the story segments we'reoften left more confused than before. Now to the "horror". This wasn't scary. Not even remotely. There wasthis one dude in the cinema that jumped at every "scary" scene, but hewas hardly someone that could be considered a normal person. Theeffects are mostly done with CGI and are HORRIBLE. They're so bad theyborder on the point of COMEDIC and yes, I did laugh out loud severaltimes during the movie. Most of the scares are either done with loudmusic and fast sudden movement to startle you or "scary" disfiguredcorpses that look like wax dolls made in a kindergarten class.That's all it is. Jump scares and awful story. There is nothing scaryabout this movie. Nothing interesting or noteworthy. The only reasonit's got such a high grade on IMDb is because of the fanboys inflatingthe rating. It'll drop soon enough.DON'T be suckered in. Don't go watch this movie. It's a waste of moneyand above all your precious time. I WANT MY TWO HOURS BACK!
