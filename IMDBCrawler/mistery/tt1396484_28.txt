I watched the original but didn't take the notice I should of whenwatching to compare both movies, but then again I don't need to - thismovie is its own perfect thing without being judged with the old TVMovie. It might be a remake (ish) but it is own thing completely, eventhough it's a remake! So watch this with or without the knowledge ofthe original. I originally thought they were going to show the youngchild being taken without any blood, but when watching it I thought itwas setting the scene throughout the whole movie and showing the bloodlike they did was perfect, and kind of shockingly good, and the timethey took on the same scene was amazingly longer than the last one. Iloved how they showed each character ion their home place and struggleswithout having each person there to join along, because we needed tosee them and how they react and work with their struggles after beingthrough them for a while, and that is without pennywise being involved.Then bringing them all together to find out, 'wait we are going throughthe same thing'. This happens very shortly into the movie, sooner thanI thought but made it fit in perfectly. And they gave them enough timeto go through all the hard times as a group to break up and get backtogether to make it in good time for the end of the movie. And theending wasn't fast, it had its own phase and took its time to makeeverything fit in and make sense, which makes sense it did perfectly.They also made it perfectly to put in - chapter 2, which the only thingyou will wish for in chapter 2 is they explain where IT came from forthis movie franchise and not go the extreme like the book/Stephen Kingdoes. As much as this is a remake they make it perfect for the 21century so I hope they do the same thing with Pennywise's backgroundbut make it not too extreme and understandable
