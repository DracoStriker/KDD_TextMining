The strength of most of what Stephen King writes- even when he's"re-imagining" classics like Dracula (SALEM'S LOT) or THE MONKEY'S PAW(PET SEMATARY) or OLD YELLER (CUJO) or the old EC Horror comics, etc.-is his CHARACTERS: they almost always Ring True. IT is no exception,and this latest reincarnation boasts excellent performances all around.(One of the more horrifying aspects of the Pennywise personification-that's only very subtly touched on in the movie- is the influence ofReal World killer clown, John Wayne Gacy.) (Here in Crack Town, we hadan old man nicknamed "Snake" and his wife who were both pedophiles.They were caught a number of times, but never went to trial "to sparethe children." When the couple left the neighborhood, the kids they'dassaulted began to sexually assault even younger kids, culminating inthe kidnapping of two five-year-olds by a young teen. Once again, thelocal "authorities" refused to prosecute. And you thought "Derry" was ascary place...) I'm looking forward to the next "chapter" in theon-going saga of IT, but this one will be hard to beat.
