Firstly I would like to say The Conjuring 2 (2016) was "THE" SCARIESTMOVIE" I've ever seen till now! Now, IT! Very bad movie direction,unwanted 2-3 jump-scares yet too kid kinda stuff... I know it's a kidbased story, but at least it should have scared the shittt outta me,but... It wasn't! At a certain point we friends felt like we shouldleave... Too stretchy, so slow and boring story. The only thing Iwanted at every scene of the movie is "REFUND". The 3 Stars I've givenis because Stephen King and also the kid with specs in the movie, I'vefind him quite realistic and funny.Psst: Don't watch it! And whoever compare this shittt with TheConjuring 2 (2016)... Jiss f u c k off! Not even a bit m scared, yetthe story was awful.
