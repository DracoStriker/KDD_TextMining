I don't have very specific complaints from the movie other than that itwas just...mediocre. And all over the place. It failed to set any"tone" to the movie. Is it supposed to be scary? Or funny? Or a mix ofboth? The character development was sort of really poor. Especiallywhen it comes to the sexual abuse victim. Comic relief was used a bit too much for a movie that's supposed toshow the darker tones of life. The fear and apprehension that shouldhave been sketched as it's supposed to be when your brother is killedoff by a paranormal evil entity was watered down by the all over theplace spectrum of emotions.And by God the length of the movie was way overstretched for thecontent that they had to offer.Just...mediocre B grade movie. The rating its getting kind of insultsthe hard work and brilliance that a lot of movies had to showcase toget the rating this movie is getting for no reason.
