It didn't feel like a horror movie, everybody in the theater waslaughing all the time due the humour in the cast, the kids make jokesall the time about everything, i was a little disappointed because ihoped i would be terrified, but i laughed more than anything. Its not ahorror movie at all, its like a parody of a horror movie.
