Nothing. This was a staggeringly ham-fisted approach to either King'snovel or the miniseries based on it. It missed the point utterly... Youwill not see a group of children whose shared bond enables them toovercome a monster. You will see a load of bickering kids who seem tobarely tolerate each other come together briefly to rescue thekidnapped object of their pre-teen lust. You will not see anintelligently-written story. You will see a dumbed-down, by-the-numbersscreenplay, complete with the usual beats, Crisis of Faith, Catharsis,and all. You will not see belief overpowering evil. You will see aten-minute fight scene where every kid tries to out-cool every otherkid and get off a Schwarzeneggerian one-liner.This movie is garbage. I can't express it more eloquently than that.
