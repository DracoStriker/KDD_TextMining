The current trend of horror movies usually involve sudden'in-your-face' movements which are pretty scary. Having seen many suchmovies, it is hard to shock the audience. This movie is based on Stephen King's book which was written back in1986. As such, it follows the trend of those times - good storyline,interesting characters, good chemistry between them, good acting & slowpsychological buildup of scary scenes rather than sudden movements. Itsa refreshing change to see such a movie. Bill Skarsgård has done asplendid job as Pennywise the shapeshifting demon. His wicked smileremains with you even after the movie. There are plenty of hidden scaryparts in the scenes which remain in the background (eg : the libraryscene). Highly recommend watching it on the big screen.
