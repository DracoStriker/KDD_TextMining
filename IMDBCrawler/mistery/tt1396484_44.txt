I was very excited to see this one. I been waiting for more than a yearafter it was announced. So I am happy to tell you this exceeds allexpectations! Let me begin with Bill Skarsgård. He was amazing as pennywise! I mean very very menacing,creepy, and played his character so great! I adored the kids in thismovie! They had great chemistry, and you can really buy that they arebest friends! Something I loved that this film did was it didn't haveany exposition. It was all visual story telling. You can tell whatscared the kids, without them just saying "(this) scares me" theydevelop their characters until you eventually find out on your own.There are many scenes or moments that finally tie into the story at theend. I loved the effort put into this movie! And of course, the horrorin It is so scary! Not the typical jump scare, false scare, loud noise,predictable scare fest we are used to with a majority of horror filmsnow a days. The scares were very unique! Some people might complain thescares were too over the top, but it's supposed to be imagination. Theemotion towards the end works so well. It made me feel sad. And last,the humor worked so good! It was very funny and all jokes landed! Iwould say my issues with the film is I wanted more screen time withpennywise. He wasn't in a lot of it until the third act. And my lastissue, I wish there wasn't as many jokes and whatnot during scenes thatare supposed to be frightening. But other than that definitely go outand see this one, good date night, or hanging out with friends! Youwill be chilled to the bone!
