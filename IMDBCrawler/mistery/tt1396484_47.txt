IT is one of the best horrors of the last 10 years in my opinion. Usingmany different camera angles to draw fright Andrés Muschietti reallytries to make IT a visual feast. At times the CGI is a letdown, withmany of the monsters (especially a flute painting) looking unrealistic,however this is made up for with the amazing looking Pennywise, whodoes not fail to live up to Tim Curry's well regarded performance. Whenthe movie focuses on the story of the losers club and their personalbullies, IT shines, the characters have great chemistry that reallyforwards the story, and each character has their own distinctpersonality's. All in all, IT was a great movie that lived up to thehype.
