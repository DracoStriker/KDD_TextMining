I don't have much to say about "It", because it's a perfect horrormasterpiece. From effective jump scares (and i mean it, no other horrormovie caused me to jump my chair), to, literally everything! If you arechoosing between movies, just go on and buy a ticket to this creepy andbeautifully crafted "ride". This heart-pounding soundtrack andeffective chills WILL hold you on to your chair to the last second ofthis masterpiece. I only rated this 9/10 because i wanted to sit stillwith my eyes glued to the screen for much longer."You'll float too"
