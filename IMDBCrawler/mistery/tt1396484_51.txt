Man, was Bill good in that role! Go watch it for his presence alone.His acting and make-up got me terrified, during the movie. The effectswere cool as well. A very good and scary adaptation of the originalfilm. Yeah, the ending was a bit flat, but don't judge it because ofthe last 15-20 min. Up until then this movie is a horror gem! 10/10! The thing i didn't expect was, that it actually was a very long movieand every bit of it was scary. That alone contributed to build-up fearinto the audience, which i guess was the point. When you have a fewchilling or scary moments in a movie, that is cool, but it does notleave a long-lasting impression after you've seen the movie. That moviedoes the opposite and it succeeds triumphantly! Can't wait for part 2!
