I never go to horror movies -- haven't seen one in over a decade --because nearly every one of them is made by those lacking talent for anaudience that lacks any understanding of what potential the horrorgenre is not living up to -- other than taking everyone's money. Theyare never scary, never frightening, never edge-of-your seat thrillingor any of the above -- OK, maybe if you're a 13 year old. I just don'tcomprehend what people see in so much garbage that is produced for thismovie genre. There is so much potential for some great films, yet theyare time after time so poorly made. A movie that truly gets into one'spsyche and creeps you out -- I suppose that's my definition of a horrormovie, but show me one that's been made that does that for anyone elsethan the teenage-mentality masses. That's because they don't know howto make them. I thought this one might be the exception -- because thetrailer looked good. ...and that's where my compliments end --- Themarketing was truly the most talented thing behind this movie, henceit's opening-weekend revenue. But don't let that fool you. It wasboring, boring, boring. Nothing is thoroughly explained. The charactersare unconvincing as it is overly acted in every scene, thereforehorribly acted. Slow. boring. Not scary. A real snoozer.
