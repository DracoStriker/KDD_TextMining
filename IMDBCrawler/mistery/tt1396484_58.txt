typical horror film not his best its more mainstream. I just don't seethe creativity in it. I want to watch a horror film that isn't sopredictable The story Line was typical yes, but even the lighting andcinematography I hope to see a new kind of scary movie in the future,One that isn't just dark lighting and pop in your face
