Disclaimer - this is my favorite book of all time.The first 10 minutes was beautiful and I had my hopes up. The amount ofdetails included from the book were very good. Then suddenly the movieturned into disjointed scenes with a bunch of scare jumps that arereally not that scary unless your perhaps 10. The deviation from the book is ridiculous, almost worse than theoriginal mini series. I think the kids did a great job and BillSkarsgård shined when they didn't ruin his character with CGI, butunfortunately this movie left me disappointed. I think people who havenot read the book might enjoy it, but they'll never get the true dread,hopelessness and fear that the book instills by watching this. I'mgoing to recommend the book instead of this attempt.
