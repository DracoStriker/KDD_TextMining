So after all the hype I really went into this movie expecting a lot. Itruly believe the best horror films are about simplicity andstereotypical jump scares just don't do it. I was hoping this moviewouldn't be composed of just that. Unfortunately I was verydisappointed. Overall I would say it was okay. The kids were great. Butafter having read the book and been a huge fan of the original I wasreally let down. ALSO ANYONE SAYING BILLS PERFORMANCE WAS BETTER THANTIM CURRYS IS ON SOMETHING. To even make such a comment shows acomplete lack in knowledge on the character of penny wise. The firstscene I felt could've been much stronger on bills part although I waspleased with the rest of his acting in the film. Even still it willNEVER compare to Tims version. I'm the original when Georgie mentionsthe paper boat floating Pennywise gives a CHILLING orgasmic reactionwhen he replies "oh yes Georgie it floats we all float down here". Thisversion was missing that initial orgasmic reaction that was socaptivating and chilling in the original. This version of Pennywise wasso cgi and over the top to a phony point it took me right out of it.And that's not a comment towards bill but rather the direction of thefilm, I have NO clue why Beverly looked into "It's" bright lights whenIn the original version that was reserved for Stan and explains hislater suicide. There were so many things changed for the negative. Ohyeah and everyone saying they went to see this or liked it all becauseStephen king said it was good is an IDIOT he makes an insane amount ofmoney in royalties off of remakes like this from his books of coursehe's going to say that. He's said that about a lot of crappy films,America regain some integrity when it comes to art and what'smainstream. This is why people like the Kardashians are famous.
