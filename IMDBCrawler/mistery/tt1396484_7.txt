I already had low expectations of this movie because of the immense CGIin the trailers. I felt super conflicted with this movie because theacting was amazing by the entire cast, however there was way too much'comic relief'. This is a horror movie. I wanted to feel terrifiedbecause I was stuck in terror just about the whole movie. I should haveleft the theater sore because of being too tense. This did not happenat all. There was only one scene in the entire movie that felt likethis and it was the bathroom scene with Beverly. That was literally it(no pun intended). The clown was so cliché when it comes to cheaphorror movie antics of the 2,000's. It has the retractable teeth likeevery new zombie movie since the Umbrella Corporation and It moves alljumpy like every ghost movie that has been out since The Ring.Absolutely NOTHING scary about the clown. If Tim Curry weren't in awheel chair I would have rather had him come back and take the place ofPenny Wise without ANY CGI. All of the CGI made this movie pure CRAP.The script writing was ridiculous and felt like it had been pushedthrough the works entirely too fast. Each kids fear was super cheesyand AGAIN, nothing but CGI on the tackiest scale they could have everdone. It felt like this movie had SO much potential but it was allthrown away because they were too afraid to make it 'actually scary'.Those of you who are REAL horror movie fans, you WILL be disappointed.This should have been a 'straight to Netflix' movie as far as I'mconcerned and I wish I could have gotten at least 1/2 of my money back
