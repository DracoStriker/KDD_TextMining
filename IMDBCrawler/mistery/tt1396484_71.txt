This for me is is a theater of the absurd ludicrous movie.In a small town a group of teenagers are going through puberty andother rites of passage including body development and monthly cycles.This in my view causes many of them to collectively imagine an evilpresence-maybe a fear of the onset of adulthood-which is played out invarious gruesome scenes featuring a killer clown. Notice that themacabre events seem to only arise in the presence of or in the minds ofthe children.Whilst Stephen King is a brilliant writer, the problem is that hisstories are usually totally ridiculous.No doubt many film reviewers and others will rave over this nonsensewhich ominously reveals this is just a start being called : Chapter 1.There are a few scenes that will have some viewers frightened plus thecinematography is good, yet despite these pluses I can only award thispicture:3/10.
