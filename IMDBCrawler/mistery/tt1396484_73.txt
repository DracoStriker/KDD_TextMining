I am Die Hard horror fan. I love Halloween 1978' Saw' Texas Chainsaw'Chucky' Jason' freddy' and many more. My review of!!!!! Just saw thismovie last night' expecting to Crap My pants since the original did. Ifyour expecting IT 2017 to be very scary' and to blow your pants off 'don't bother seeing it. I was kind of disappointed and was expectingthe new IT Film to deliver more of a frightening bloody more detailFILM. This is a whole different FILM nothing like the original from the1900s. the new IT FILM has nothing to do with the original.. this movieshould have had some part with the original. This movie in my books Didnot deliver.... The only good things about this FILM. the kids in this movie worked hard. This Film has more blood than theoriginal'. this film shows what kids did in the 1980s ... This film hasmore violent scenes' I would say this NEW It Movie will beat theoriginal in Blood' violence' swearing' just overall more going with theflow....The bad things. The movie was rushed' the movie does not follow theoriginal' the Film kind of does not make sense and this Film is notvery detailed like the original... The original was planned out ' ithad major twist' it just had more details' the original had you on yourseats wanting more' this new film does not... The new it FILm was OKand yes I will watch it again but is it worth waiting for nooooo. The 1990 Clown was more real ' the new Clown is more scary but is moreFakeish not very impressed with the director going with this new clownlook. It very well could of been way better and could of delivered amuch better much more detailed Film Like the original did.... Theoriginal will go down in history as being the best of killer clowns... Hopefully IT 2017 for part 2 will be better. Maybe it will change mymind and give me something that's like the original... You never know.
