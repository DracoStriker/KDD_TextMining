So,there is so much potential with this adaptation. Bill Skarsgard'sPennywise could be so good. He is dark and haunting, and everything Iwant from Pennywise. When he is allowed to inhabit Pennywise, I thinkhe outshines Curry. That said, the CGI in this movie is distracting tothe point of absurdity. The truly unsettling parts are when either Billhas his few moments to actually act Pennywise, or when the children aredealing with their societal issues (which, of course, is central to thestory). Pennywise, in his hyper-CGI'd manifestation, however, isfarcical which does a massive disservice to the depth and darknessSkarsgard brings to his character. The CGI also does a disservice tothe real horrors the children in this story face. The scariest thingsare those closest to our realm - whether that is the complexities ofgrowing up, abuse, and bullying, or fu#*ing terrifying clowns.
