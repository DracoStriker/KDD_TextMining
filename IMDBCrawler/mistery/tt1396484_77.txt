On IMDb, this movie could win the title of the 'Most Inflated Ratingsof All time...ever'. I gave this movie 3 starts for some visuals andbold scenes in the beginning that quickly faded and stopped workingonly minutes into the movie.This film tries hard to copy the original, but fails to develop a storybadly. The characters are boring and undeveloped, there is literally nocharacter development there. A great deal of effort has been spent tobring more detailed visuals with intricate special effects, but alone,they do very little for the movie. Between these sequences of nowboring special effects, we get a severely stretched and boring storythat you just don't want to follow, because there is nothing to follow.The dialogue was poorly delivered.I really hate to say this, but this movie is complete and uttergarbage.
