I've never took time out of my non-busy schedule to write a review, butI have to write one for IT. (Laughing) When I tell you guys that Iforgot what IT was, I'm not kidding you. I was honestly looking forBarb because I thought the kids were in the upside down aka I thought Iwas watching Stranger Things...in IMAX. I can't believe I fell for thehype (hides face in shame). I loved that this movie focused in on thekids and didn't go back and forth, but the original, which I vaguelyremember, still beats this remake! I think the actors were great, theone kid looks like Ali, and I thought their banter was realistic andsuper funny; the whole theater was cracking up. If you have absolutelynothing else to do with your time, money, and/or you aredepressed...check out Stranger Things...I'm sorry I mean IT.
