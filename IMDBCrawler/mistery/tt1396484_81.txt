The kids are great actors. The visual effects are obviously impressive at times. However:The film lacks narrative; just jumped from one dramatic scene toanother, relentlessly. This meant there was no opportunity to buildtension, or to show off any kind of writing.Poor script. The film tries to hang off its CGI Pennywise, over-use of comedic jerkymonster-movements and loud stand-alone scenes. Too much talking from Pennywise.Missed opportunities for the whole town and adults to succumb to thepervading sense of evil that I would expect from ITI was more scared talking about a memory of a good horror film on theway home. Laughable. It's like eating a whole bag of pick and mix for your dinner thinkingit will satisfy you.
