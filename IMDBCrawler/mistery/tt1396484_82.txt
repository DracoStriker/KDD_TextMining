Well i've learnt that i cant even trust IMDb ratings anymore.Seriously??? Don't get sucked in with the high ratings. This movie waslike a badly written comedy with absolutely nothing scary about it atall. A true horror fan like myself will be leaving the cinemadisappointed. What i did like is the gore but apart from that i thoughti was watching a spoof comedy horror film.How do a group of kids who get beat up by bullies manage to kill achild eating clown? OK, i give up. You'll float too. No thanks.
