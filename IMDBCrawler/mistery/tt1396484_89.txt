First I wanna say great family movie, bring the kids... So they canlaugh along with you, I don't want to spoil the immense amount ofnothing that happens in this movie, or how you'll grow bored of waitingfor "it" to get scary, but I do want to know how much they were payingpeople walking into the screenings giving this movie a 10 star rating,or how large is the pr team? I laugh when I see red balloons now.Thought I was going to see a horror movie, got a comedy.. Talk about alet down.
