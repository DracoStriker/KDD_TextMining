This is the first time that I ever posted here on IMDb though I havevalued this page for about 8 years now.I need to first start off saying that I never read the book. I neversaw the 1990 mini series.Just returned from seeing IT (2017) about 5 minutes ago. I personallyloved every minute of IT.I am seeing negative and positive reviews on this here on IMDb and onFB.This movie kept me glued to my seat all the way through. I left themovie just saying "wow" to myself over and over and over again. I agree that it had more CGI effects than needed. Personally I lovedthe sound. I think it helped startle the crowd. Everyone in the theaterjust jumped at all the parts where the surprises came.Don't want to give away or spoil IT. I am not a book reader of anykind. I do however would like to see the 1990 mini series version justto check IT out.I thought the story was held together quite nicely despite some obviousflaws in the filming (which is why I gave it an 8/10).Personally I do not have an issue with clowns. Those that do shouldprobably not see this movie IMHO as you will have some gnarlynightmares.From what I am seeing there are a lot of folks that have experiencefrom reading the book and watching the mini series. I am actually gladthat I do not have experience with either. For me it was fresh and hadenough gore but not too much gore. I thought that the actors/actresses played their parts well and totallyadded to the entertainment value of the presentation. Right from the beginning when Georgie was floating the paper boat downthe stream and into the gutter I was already hooked (which is in thetrailer, so no, not a spoiler). I am totally looking forward to seeing the next part.If you like a good thriller and you have no experience with the book ormini series I can honestly recommend seeing this flick.
