I really enjoyed this incarnation of IT but I can't help but be biasedsimply because I am such a fan of the original. There were some thingsbetter about this film and some things better about the original, butwhat stood out most was the cast of kids in the original were vastlysuperior. Each character in the original had an unusual quality thatmade them stand out in some way while the kids in this film just kindof blended in with the crowd. The Ritchie Tozier character in theoriginal played by Seth Green was far better and I was a bit let downthey took away most of what made him so funny and unique with the gagsand jokes and stuff. They also left out Ben's backstory about hisfather who died in the war and the fact he and his mother were forcedto live with relatives. That was an important part of the storyline Idon't think they should have omitted. The story telling overall wasbetter in the original with the way the group came together. The storyin the current film did feel rushed at times but overall a veryenjoyable movie.
