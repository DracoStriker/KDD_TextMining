For a younger audience, unjaded by so many horror and suspense flicks,this movie will probably be creepier. This version of the story issomewhat a victim of itself. So many derivatives have occurred over theyears, many from King novels, including this one, that this remakesuffers as somewhat less of the same. At my 55 years of age, it justnever hit a fear climax. Sure, some great scenes, just not enoughimpact. For the younger audience, I expect it would be great. Also,perhaps by the edit- down for the screen play, the story seemed toleave a lot of plot holes uncompleted, and seemed to violate its ownplane of existence. Appropriate for Netflix, or a young couple on adate.
