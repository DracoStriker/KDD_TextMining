I have an irrational fear of clowns and it was nothing short of an actof congress to get me to see this film. I had a hard enough time withthe TV series back in the day with the amazing Tim Curry but I have tosay Bill Skarsgård will haunt my nightmares from here on out. Theacting int the film is exceptional as is every other element of themovie. They truly went out of their way to place you back in the 80'smidsummer. I felt as if I was a child watching a scary movie for thefirst time as I sat there in the theater trembling... I have mixedopinions on how to answer the question of if I like this movie, a largepart of me screams NO but solely the fear of clowns, while the rest ofmy bellows YES from the tops of my lungs. I would recommend the film toanyone who might be looking for a masterfully made scary movie oranyone in love with Stephen Kings works... because this won't let youdown, even if they all float.
