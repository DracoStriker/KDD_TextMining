The Dark Tower by Stephen King is an expansive story that spans 7books, telling Roland the Gunslinger's journey to the Tower; involvingdifferent genres, many characters, many worlds - a big lore. At a certain point whether you have read the series or not is probablyirrelevant. If you haven't read the books, I would imagine the moviejust will feel flat and lifeless, with only a few scenes fromMcConaughey standing out. There's very little plot and characterdevelopment, which comes across as a lump of clichés. If you have readthe books, you'll likely find the movie a spectacular failure,wondering how the writers managed to dumb down such promising materialto a 95 minute generic action movie, and making an actor like IdrisElba overact in a character that should have endless potential. Thefinal result is so hollow and narrow, if you have watched the trailer,you may just count yourself as having seen the whole thing. If you are intrigued by the story, skip this movie, and give the firstbook of the series a go.
