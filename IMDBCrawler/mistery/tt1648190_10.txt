I've heard the nay Sayers, but once again I'm glad I did not listen tocritics. It was true enough to the book but fresh enough to make iteven more interesting. Amazing cast. Yes, I have read all the books andall the spin-off books and short stories as well. The acting wasexcellent. The only thing is this is the last book in the Gunslingerseries of eight books So it is like Stars Wars in a way. It now willhave to back track so that people who haven't read the book havealready seen how the series panned out. It will make all the backsequels better. Idris Elba fit the role of gunslinger Roland very welland served as both a mentor and bad-ass. I whistled and applauded atthe end of this movie, something I never do. It gets a ten Star Ratingfrom me.
