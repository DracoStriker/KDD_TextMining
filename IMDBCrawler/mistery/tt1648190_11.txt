This movie had all the suspense of an excellent sci-fi flick. If youhave ever read, watched or listened to fiction stories, books or moviesand enjoyed them, then this is no different. The actors gave stellarperformances and the director and producers gave us a very entertainingproduct. I really could care less about reviews. I have always ignoredthem, since no one is capable of convincing me he or she knows whatentertainment means to me. After all, the operative word is"entertainment." Go see the movie, you won't be disappointed.
