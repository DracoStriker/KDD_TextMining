I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. I wish it had beenthree hours long. And, no, I'm not a fan of the novels, although I maydive in. But any film this decent that enrages the finger-sniffingfanboys of the online world gets an extra star on IMDb from me.Admit it: Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are brilliant actors wellcast as the mortal opponents in a cosmic struggle of good and evil.Telling their epic tale through the boy Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor, alsoworthy of praise) is an inspired narrative device that appears to bemuch of the sand in joints in the fanboys who trash the reputation of ahighly worthy film.Like Watchmen, another excellent film that irritated fanboys, The DarkTower is a wild ride across an action packed multiverse.I want more. Lots more.
