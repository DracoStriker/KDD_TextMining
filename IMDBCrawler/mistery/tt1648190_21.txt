I saw The Dark Tower just today and I think that the reviews have beengenerally unfair. If readers of the Steven King books on which it isbased expect it to be faithful to them they will probably be let downbecause his novels are just too long and detailed for this to bepossible. I have only read the first book of the Tower series so Ican't make a judgment. I will say however that this film is highlyentertaining and has quite a good story overall. Great action scenesbetween Roland the gunslinger and the Man In Black. Tom Tyler as theboy Jake is a damn good young actor. I've heard that there are plans tomake a TV show from this but of course that will depend on the movie'sbox office success and the poor reviews won't help this cause either. Ipersonally hope this does happen as this is a good cinema effort and Iliked it a lot!
