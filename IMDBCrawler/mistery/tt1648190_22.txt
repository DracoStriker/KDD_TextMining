Regardless of the negative reviews this movie received, I couldn'tresist seeing a Stephen King film. Many reviewers/critics mentioned themovie was too different from the book, but I read The Dark Tower seriesback in the 80's, so it wasn't fresh in my mind. Matthew McConaugheyplayed an excellent villain, and the rest of the cast did a great jobas well. In my opinion, it was worth watching in the theater. Don't goexpecting the over-usage of blood, gore and language that is typical ina flick based on a King book. I enjoyed the story-line and action,which is a great reason to watch it on the big screen.
