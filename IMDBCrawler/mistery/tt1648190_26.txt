I'm going to say it straight up front! If you're going to do a movieadaptation of a book, that has a dedicated, loyal and massive fan base,then you don't start off by totally deconstructing the main characterin such a fundamental way! Everyone who has read the books knows thatRoland was a Clint Eastwood/ High Plains Drifter kinda guy, even Kinghimself has stated that Eastwood was who he had in mind, physically,when he created the Roland character. Idris Elba should never have beencast as Roland! He may be a great actor, but he was not right for thisrole. Stephen King should never have agreed to this major change andshould have kept to the Roland Deschain character as described in hisbooks. There were so many other actors who would have suited the rolefar better. Even Matthew McConaughey, who was cast as Walter, the Manin Black, would have made a great Roland. Viggo Mortensen, anothergreat choice. The producer, Akiva Goldsman, told anyone who dared todisagree with his decision to cast Mr. Elba as Roland, to go "F"themselves! Goldman wrote the script and cast the characters, so Iguess he holds a major part in why this movie failed miserably on somany levels. I just pray that Goldman has no part to play in theadaptation of The Dark Tower series, if it ever makes it to TV.
