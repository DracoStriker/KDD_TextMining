OK, so if you have read any of the other reviews you will see a lot of"Another Failure to adapt Stephen Kings Books to Film" or "Yet Anotherweak movie based around a Stephen King Novel" well I say enough. Thereis a reason that SK's novels don't adapt to film well and that isbasically because they are dull, average and (To quote family guy) hemust be the least imaginative writer of this generation. He waffles andbuilds characters in the same fashion that most of us interact witheach other. Hidden within writing is the ability to constructcharacters that you are likely to find in Maine, he does not go farafield. As you learn of these people a eerie presence builds upspotlighting at something dreadful. At the great reveal it all justdoes a Bobby Ewing dream sequence. A giant spider, a devil, AlienCraft, a possessed car, a demon dog, a disaster at the nuclear powerstation blah blah blah. The Bachmann books were cool for their time butthis is not that. This is a movie based around the books, not thebooks. Sit back relax watch without prejudice and in all its not a badfilm. Try to ignore the stupid few who think this is an adaptation ofStephen Kings Books and how those books played out in individual minds.Like the voices the give old comic strips, it will never please all ofus because our internal dialogue has chosen already. See it
