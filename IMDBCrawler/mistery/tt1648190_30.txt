I was really nervous about this one because I am a hardcore StephenKing fan and I had read a couple of nasty reviews about it. But youknow what? I really enjoyed myself!I mean, let's face it, there is no way thousands of pages could besqueezed into 1h35m. The movie is based on the Dark Tower series, it isnot supposed to portray it step by step. And I think the two maincharacters are as fairly portrayed as possible. Sure, Roland is a lotmore talkative, there are some scenes clearly just for FX show and/orcomedy, Jake learned to control his power much too quickly/easily andthe gunslinger creed is a bit abused, but overall this was an excitingmovie and I found myself enthralled.I was particularly blown away by Matthew McConaughey. How the hell didhe manage to create a character that is both so evil AND sexy? I haveto admit I had some nasty thoughts watching him. My goodness, how canhe just arrive into a room and with one look terrify me? I can't evenproperly explain it. He's all business. He owns his power and has thisinnate arrogance to him. Really, I can't explain it, just know this isan incredibly built villain.Gangly Jake was also a pleasant surprise but next to McConaughey andElba it was difficult for the boy to shine.I actually enjoyed the whole gunslinger's purpose vs revenge. I cannotremember if that was present in the books, I read them quite a whileago, but I felt that was a good theme to serve as the film's motto.All in all, I am really happy with this adaptation and was thoroughlyentertained. I definitely recommend it.
