I am a King fan but not of this particular series of books although Iget why fans of the series may be disappointed that it was condensedinto one film. In saying that, if you just take this as a fantasyaction film then I really don't get the hate for it. It was well actedby all involved, the effects were good and the story kept moving along.One reviewer described it as the worst film of the year and all I cansay to that is that is you need to watch more films as there have beensome howlers and this definitely isn't one of them. I would agree withthe person who said this was "inspired by" rather than "based on" thebooks and I do think people who haven't read the books so aren'texpecting a straight adaptation will enjoy it for what it is. Insummary, I would ignore the hate for this and if you fancy a goodaction film give it a go. You could do a lot worse.
