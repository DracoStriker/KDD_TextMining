I had hoped to watch Roland-Idris quietly move through a vast andsurreal desert (the book like).Both Jake (kid) and Walter (villain) get more screen time than Rolandhowever. And 75% takes place in NYC, not Mid-World. (If I wanted NYC,would have stayed home and watched Seinfeld or Goodfellas....)Casting was great.Ending was horrid.An extra star for the attempt of S. King multiverse. They even stolehalf the plot from Doc Sleep.I assume all plans for sequels and a spin off show are now dead &buried. Matthew McConaughey should reprise the character in a remake of TheStand (HBO).
