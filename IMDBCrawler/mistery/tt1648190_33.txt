I love Stephen King.Stephen King have amazed me, thrilled me, scared me and made me yearnfor more for years.Sadly this sub-mediocre film does none of that.You can watch this movie with or without having read the books. My bestbet is that many, if not most people will at best be underwhelmed bythis sloppy piece of junk, no matter if they have read the books ornot.Judging from test audiences, Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, then I am notthe only one feeling that way.The plot lines have none of Kings vibrancy or suspense, if there atall. Its confusing and shoddy. The acting is shallow and unbelievableat best, and unwittingly hilarious or sad at worst.The film is a confused shambles and leaves everything to be desired.I can not feel or see the vision of the Director, if one ever existed.Some have with good cause drawn the analogy of the filming of the lordof the Rings.If so, then this movie is more on the line of the "The Lord of theRings" by Ralph Bakshi, the strange rotoscoping/animated movie from1978.Except that Bakshis movie at least had some originality, which The DarkTower utterly lacks.Perhaps the fact that this movie was in Development hell for 10 years,should have told someone something.Having read the books, then the film goes from mediocre to a bad joke:The casting is way off and the whole setup is rather (poorly) inspiredby the books, than an actual adaptation of the books.The pretence is that, presumably because the team failed utterly inactually making an adaptation of the books, that this is a"continuation" of them. Which it quite obviously is not, its just a bad rewrite, and an evenpoorer film.On a different but parallel not, then to me many of the positivereviews of this movie on IMDb, looks very similar indeed. But hey: lookfor yourself and draw your own conclusions.A recommendation I sadly cannot make for this movie.
