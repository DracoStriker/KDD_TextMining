Worst film of the year in my personal opinion. You have MM and Elba,you have 8 - EIGHT - books of material, and you do a movie that is hourand a half long, you butcher the material, and after all, you don'tmake the Gunslinger the central character in the movie. This project should've been straightforward: Chronologically you startwith the genesis of the conflict between Ronald and the Man in Black,you build your characters toward the conflict aka Last Stand, and youend the movie in the dark, just before the start of the first book.Movie of 2, 2.5 hours, dark, with R-rating. You exploit the potentialof the brilliant actors at your disposal. You just don't do this. Rubbish. I gave it three stars just because ofMcConaughey and his obviously good performance as the Man in Black.
