I'm not exactly sure what I just saw. The only thing I do know is itwasn't The Dark Tower. That wasn't the Roland Deschain I know. Itwasn't Jake Chambers either, or The Man in Black. Other people Iexpected to see weren't even there. Important people like Cuthbert,Alain, Eddie, Suzanna... none of them were even hinted at.I wasn't taken to the world I expected. It was an odd place with a fewelements of Roland's world, but they were strangely distorted. Portalsare now transport machines, left behind by the old ones it seems,rather than magical things controlled by demons. And yet the house isstill a demon apparently - but just because it offered a good chancefor fancy graphics. Without a Suz to meet up with a demon while the menget Jake through where does this story go? It certainly doesn't go toThe Dixie Pig because Roland has already destroyed it. It doesn't go toThe Dark Tower, because Roland and Jake have already been there too andsaved it.It's like this was some weirdly condensed version of books 1, 2, 3, and7. Except It only took tiny bits and pieces from the books and createda whole new story that really didn't resemble the epic Stephen Kingwrote at all! I feel cheated and betrayed. I just don't understand howKing let this happen.
