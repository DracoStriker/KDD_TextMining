All the negative reviews did this movie a favor (for me)... I went intoit thinking it was going to be complete garbage but it was a prettygood production.Even though it was very thin, I was entertained the entire film. But Iwas left wanting so much more. Having not read the book I can onlyimagine how frustrating this movie would be for those who had.Along the same lines, the movie was too short, I wish they added anhour or so and used that time to build the story, dive into thecharacters, etc.
