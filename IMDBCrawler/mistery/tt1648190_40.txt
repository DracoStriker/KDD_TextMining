I did not read the book and I am grateful for that. Apparently everyonewho read the book hated the movie. I watched the movie for what it wasand I enjoyed it. The story line was great. Matthew played a terrificbad guy and the relationship of the kid and gunslinger washeartwarming. It is an entertaining movie and worth watching. I thinkbook readers had high expectations that no one was going to be able toreach.
