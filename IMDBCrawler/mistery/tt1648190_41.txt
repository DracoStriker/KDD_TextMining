Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are deservedly cemented in my mindas Roland and Walter from here on out... they and Tom Taylor saved thisfilm from being a meh five-star offering. Don't get me wrong, I lovedit, but I loved it because as a fan of the books, I was getting atantalisingly convincing window onto Mid-World. It was extremelyfaithful in atmosphere and visualisation. I also enjoyed the hell outof the gunfights, thought that the Taheen were well done, loved thesmall nods to the books that were scattered throughout. Plenty to love!The stripped-down plot and changes were inevitable, although it washard not to begrudge every minute that could have added a bit moreback-story, or hint of the canon. The ending suffered from the film'sapparent need not to hold us up for too long... choppily edited into amontage of all-manner-of-things-were-well, including orchestra burstand the sun back-lighting the Tower.Not the worst ending in cinematic history, certainly... but it left mewith a lack of closure, principally because after multiple iterationsof the same quest, Roland carrying the Horn of Eld on his back stronglyhints that this is not just a mishmash of our go-round-the-wheel thatwe know as Constant Readers, but a different iteration altogether,perhaps the last one, Roland's redemption. And for that to beacceptable, I would need a lot more information than was handled in a95 minute film...... it'd probably take, like, at least seven books.
