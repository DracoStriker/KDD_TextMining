As far as i see, most people didn't like and hated the movie, but idon't think like them. It is not a bad movie but there are some funnyand silly visual effects for making us laugh. I say that the directordirected this movie in very quick way, which i didn't like it. But therest of the movie is OK. I didn't read the books but i got the storywell. This is a classic Stephen King logic. I realized something in themovie: you know that Stephen King obsessed the 1408 number, also he hasa movie named 1408. I assumed you know the 1408 numbers combination. Idon't wanna make spoiler. We saw many movies like that but for me thismovie is related to alternate or parallel universe. ?t is not like aDark Tower story, it is like a guardian story.
