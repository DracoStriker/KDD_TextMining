I went to see this movie alone, without my family, because I'd readthat it wasn't very good. Well, I've gone back three more times, WITHmy family, because we all loved it. Matthew McConaughey is perfect asThe Man in Black, and after seeing Idris Elba in the role of theGunslinger, I can't imagine anyone else in it. Tom Taylor, the youngactor playing Jake, was super. We loved the storyline and while someviewers commented that the movie was poorly written, we really enjoyedthis movie. I've read the Dark Tower series and am not disappointed inthis movie adaptation at all. A friend and I went to see themuch-heralded, Oscar-nominated Arrival and almost fell asleep -- so Idon't really give much credit to movies touted by critics as the nextbig Oscar winner. You won't waste your money seeing this, and whileI've read some are upset the movie is barely over 90 minutes, I felt alot was accomplished in that time and I never felt shortchanged becausethe movie wasn't 2+ hours. Yes, there are some differences between thebooks and the movie but this is still an excellent story...manyinteresting plot twists and as I said we were very pleased with thecasting. Well worth your cinema dollars!
