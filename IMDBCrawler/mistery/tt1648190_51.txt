Without a doubt the worst adaptation of a book I've ever seen, andhorribly directed. It is amazing how a director can totally destroy hisown movie with his own stupidity. I am deeply disappointed in RonHoward for having anything to do with this garbage. Idris Elba wascompletely the wrong actor to play Roland, and Mcconaughey'sperformance was so literally stupid. This is a prime example of whatNot to do in film making. Nikolaj Arcel is an idiot as a director. Andthe screenwriters should be expelled from their guild. Fans have waitedyears to see The Dark Tower made, and this is what we get? Shame onStephen King for even allowing this to happen. I guess that accidentreally did screw up his marbles. All in all, there is nothing worthspending your money on to see here.
