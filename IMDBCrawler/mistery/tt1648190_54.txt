There's been a lot of publicity stating how the Stephen King novelseries was inspired partly by an old poem (called "Childe Roland To TheDark Tower Came") and partly by the spaghetti-Westerns of Sergio Leoneback in the 1960's. Me? I would've called the resulting movieadaptation a cross between MAD MAX and the original STAR WARS (aka"Episode 4: A New Hope"). But, no matter how you describe the inherent similarities, the factremains that this is a great action-adventure flick with fantasyswashbuckler elements that just manage to rise above the stereotypical.For starters, there's the poignancy of Jake Chambers' dysfunctionalhome life (biological dad died a hero; mom remarried a self-centeredjerk). Which, of course, is nicely balanced by the comedy relief ofRoland's culture shock at the so-called "civilization" still extant onKeystone Earth. Case in point?Roland: "Are bullets as rare on your world as they are here?"Jake: "You're going to like Earth. A lot!"My one and only complaint with this film, however, is that its trailersuse outtakes for previews (a practice aggravatingly all too common inHollywood)! I refer specifically to the scene where Jake tries to gaugethe depths of Walter the MIB's inherent evil through a comparison toChristianity's greatest enemy. And Roland replies "He's worse."Why was that bit of dialogue edited out? Time and money constraints? Ortoo much potential controversy from religious fundamentalist groups?Well, whatever the reason, it still should have been left in. So, I amleaving one point out of my final score.
