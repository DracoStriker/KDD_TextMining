The long awaited Dark Tower film is a well acted and well directed. Itis not perfect of course as no book adaptation can be perfect (exceptmaybe from Lord Of The Rings trilogy) but it achieves its goal to giveyou a good taste of the amazing Dark tower world. A small taste withits 95min run it is true but yet a good one.Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are both great in their roles.Looking forward for more of the Dark Tower world.
