The way I interpret this movie:A young boy is traumatized by losing his fire-fighting father in thetower disaster of 9/11. In his mind he fantasizes with how he canprevent a dark tower from collapsing and this film illustrates hisfantasy.This is a surprisingly good sci-fi action movie thanks to the charismaof the child star and the actor playing gunslinger who becomes asurrogate father to the boy. Both players have great chemistrytogether.Good action and special effect; sufficient humor makes this picture awinner for me!6 and a half rounded up:7/10.
