Since when we judge movies based on books! Those two are totallydifferent experiences. I absolutely loved this movie. Simply, one of myfavorites this summer and I would never ever listen to critics again. Iwent to watch other movies based on reviews and left Dark Tower tillthe end and man I wish I watched Dark Tower first. I simply can't waittill the next one. I hope there will be more than one!
