I have read the books three times and followed a lot of comments andeven spoilers on social media so I went to the movie not knowing whatto expect.I enjoyed every minute. For me it was a brilliant introduction to theworld of Stephen King's The Dark Tower. Lots of Easter eggs in therewhich are fun.The portrayal of the main characters, the make up and special effects Ithought were cleverly done to turn such a huge epic work into a90minute taster of what I hope is more to come.Do sit through to the end of the credits.
