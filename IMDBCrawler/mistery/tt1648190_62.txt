I'm a Tower-enthusiast for 20 years, read all 8 boos multiple times.The movie is not an adaptation, it's not the story of Ronald and thetower as told in the books. Maybe it's a later, or earlier cycle ofRonald's quest. (Ka is a wheel, remember?) This may account for thesignificant differences, e.g. Jake's backstory, the fact that Walterhas the complete set of Wizard glass, etc. So maybe try to accept thefact that you are not going to see the story from the books come tolife in a literal way, and then you can actually enjoy the movie. Andespecially enjoy the things you do recognize from the story you read.Is it worth 10 stars, probably not. But it's certainly worth much morethan most reviewers gave, that's why I gave it 10.PS. I saw it together with someone who didn't read the books, shereally liked the movie and we are definitely going to check out thesequel!
