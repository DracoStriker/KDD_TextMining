I don't agree with the people rating the movie badly just because itisn't completely accurate to the books, the movie should be rated onhow good it was as a movie.I found The Dark Tower to be a very entertaining and touching movie.There was no point in the movie where I thought there was bad writingor directing, everything seemed well thought over.There is great acting by Idris Elba and Tom Taylor. Definitely wouldrecommend.
