The Dark Tower (2017) ** (out of 4)Jake (Tom Taylor) is having weird dreams of another world. Pretty soonhe is pulled into that other world when he walks through a portal andsoon has the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) tracking him. The onlyone who can protect Jake is the man known as The Gunslinger (IdrisElba).I guess I should start off by saying that I haven't read any of thebooks by Stephen King so I really can't say what this movie got rightor wrong. With that said, I've always thought novels and movies are twodifferent things so I've never expected any movie to follow the noveldown to every word. With that said, I have read that many peopleconsider these novels to be masterpieces and perhaps they are but noneof that translates to the screen here.Some people are downright outraged with this adaptation and they arecalling it one of the worst ever made. I'm not sure I share that hatredbut at the same time I'm not familiar with the novels. I will say thatI found the movie to be incredibly disappointing on a number of levelsbut I think the biggest problem was the direction by Nikolaj Arcel. Isay this because the film is completely lifeless from the openingscenes to the very last and there really wasn't a single moment wherethe director manged to grab my attention and keep it focused on thefilm.What really kills this movie is that it runs just 95-minutes and yetit's deadly dull and that running time honestly feels longer. There'sno energy in the picture and whatever magics was in the novelscertainly didn't make it to the screen. Even with the story that's hereyou'd think that there would be something good or something that drewyou in but there just wasn't. It's really too bad because I thoughtboth McConaughey and Elba were quite good in their roles. I wasn't asimpressed with Taylor but I'd probably blame that on the director too.THE DARK TOWER isn't the disaster that some have made it out to be.It's a bland movie that doesn't have too much going for it.
