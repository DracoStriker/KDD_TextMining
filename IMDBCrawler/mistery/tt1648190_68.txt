This movie should have been advertised as "slightly inspired by thebook", not as an adaptation of it. It was barely the same plot andlacked several of the main (and more interesting) characters. Itreminded me of every other young adult action movie. I've read most ofthe series, and was appalled at this "adaptation". I want that 90minutes of my life back!
