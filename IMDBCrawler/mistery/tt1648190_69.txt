Excuse my hubris for asserting that I know exactly what was wrong withthis film, but I do: it was actually three films crammed into the spaceof one. Admission: I was not a fan of the Dark Tower series. I loveStephen King but felt the Gunslinger, which I did read, wascharacteristic of his most annoying proclivity for compulsive writing.I know a lot of King fans love his ability to just wing-it untilsomething interesting happens. But to me it is like someone telling ajoke that never reaches the punchline. King has written some of myfavorite books, The Shining, The Stand, IT, Green Mile and so manyclassic short stories. But although I made it through Gunslinger I wasnot inspired to go any further in that series. Too much meandering...sort of like this review. That said, I was looking forward to the film.The trailers looked good. Great cast. But the end result was rushed andunfocused. A relevant digression: I have two versions of a film called"Warriors Of The Rainbow: Seediq Bale". It's a dramatization of a truestory about a handful of Pacific islanders who took on the Japanesearmy in WW2, The original is great. A 2 DVD set and lasts over 4 hours.But the USA release is a 1 disc re-edit that's about 2.5 hours. Andit's just awful. I saw the short version first and could tell there isa great film hiding in there somewhere. And that's the same way I feltwatching Dark Tower. There were great moments and scenes, but nocrescendos, nothing was built up enough to have any real impact.Problem is there's no 2 disc version to save it. The studio should havecommitted to this work; invested the money and time to make a goodseries. But they took the short cut and wound up loosing money. Stupid.(btw: if you check out Warriors Of The Rainbow, do NOT get the shortversion. It's as bad as watching Dark Tower.)
