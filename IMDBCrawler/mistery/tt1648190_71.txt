If you were to watch this movie totally ignoring the fact that it wascreated from Stephen King's genius then you would be entertained. Ifyou were to watch it expecting anything similar to the books thenexpect to be horribly disappointed. The movie is well cast and IdrisElba delivers a solid performance as Roland but just about all the bitsyou found entertaining from the book s simply aren't there. You almostget the impression that this was just mailed in to make a few dollars.This movie could have been great but simply wasn't. Huge disappointmentfor King fans.
