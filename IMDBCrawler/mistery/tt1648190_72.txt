I loved the books but this is complete rubbish. Even on its own and notcomparing it to the books its a terrible film with a stupid premise andpathetic plot. The characters are totally undeveloped and unexplainedand the plot is stupid and pointless and does not involve the viewer inany way shape or form. Don't bother. Read the book instead.
