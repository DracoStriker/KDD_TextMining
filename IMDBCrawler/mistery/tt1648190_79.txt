Idris Elba is a great actor, but I cannot picture him as Roland afterhaving read all 8 books. Roland is a skinny, near-transparent white manwith blonde hair that is surprisingly strong for such a thin person.The never-ending journey to the dark tower has been long andtreacherous and it has taken its toll on the protagonist. Thus, havinga big man (white or black) play Roland completely misses the point.It's as simple as that. I can obviously only judge the movie throughthe eyes of a book- reader. And it's blatantly absurd for the directorto claim that they ended-up with a 90' movie out of 8 books of materialbecause they didn't want to overwhelm the audience. No, they made aseries of bad decisions that resulted in a bad movie. They didn'tdevelop the characters, there was no info on Mid-World, no mysteryabout the tower, no mention of Gilead's importance and on and on andon... And why weren't the book-readers enough of an audience? As far asI'm aware, the books are bestsellers having sold millions of copieseach. Why not cater for them I wonder? We were waiting for a Dark Towermovie for years and years. What a waste of time and money...
