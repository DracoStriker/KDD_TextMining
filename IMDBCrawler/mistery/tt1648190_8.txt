For the fans of the books who didn't like the variance from the moviesdid you not read or look in to the movie at all before you went? Thereare a lot of interviews with the cast and King that tell you this is atotal retelling of Roland's next trip through the door not just a lineby line script made of the books. I think it lays out very nicely agroundwork for what is yet to come. I would much rather see a newjourney than the one I have read and listened to so many times before.These are great characters and they deserve a new journey and I can'twait to see what it brings this time. So many great references to whatis yet to come.Please make the miniseries and I can't wait for the next movie!
