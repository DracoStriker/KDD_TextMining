The books that this movie is 'based' on are fantastic. They give morethan enough content to make a trilogy but Hollywood wants to dumbeverything down and make a quick buck with an action movie.They totally gutted the content in the movie and as a result the movieis very flat. This movie is too short to even cover the first book.I can't believe that Stephen King signed off on this! As a side note,Matthew McConaughey is fantastic in this movie - really the only reasonto see it are his scenes and I'm not even really a fan of his.Do your self a favor and spend your time doing something worth whileinstead of watching this Hollywood POS.
