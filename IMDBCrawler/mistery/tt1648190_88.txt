I have to be careful not to overstate this movie's grade. I have beenguilty of doing that a few times immediately after a movie. Maybe thetheater ambiance got to me or maybe one good scene stuck with me so Irate the entire movie based upon that. I can still say that this movieis good. Idris Elba as the Gunslinger and Matthew McConaughey as the antagonist,Walter, were great. Their performances were right on point. They didn'tdo too much nor too little.The story was also good. This movie was based upon a Stephen King novelof the same title and King rarely swings and misses. The base premisewas that of good versus evil. More specifically it was about the demonworld seeking entry into the human world and the coalition ofgunslinger, seer, and shiner attempting to prevent it.There was some good action in a measured amount. Likewise, there was asmall dose of comedic scenes to provide levity as there were the heavyscenes that caused the heart to pound. I enjoyed the movie and I coulddefinitely see there being a sequel.
