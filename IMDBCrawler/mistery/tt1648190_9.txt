At first, when I decided to try watch this kind of 'genre', I thoughtit was just another ordinary sci-fi story that will just make me feelbored. But from the beginning of the movie, it started to catch myattention that makes me crave to know more about it. The more I craveto know, the story become so damn interesting! Yeah, I must say thatfrom my point of view, the story line is not cliché and it has its own'recipe' that stand out from one another. The idea is fresh and I likethe way they blend fantasy and reality to make it as a new flavor infilm history. I don't understand why most people critics about thismovie but in my opinion, this type of movie is something that deserve10/10. The Dark Tower - the best movie I watch so far in 2017
