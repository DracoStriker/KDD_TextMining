This film spent a decade in production hell and anyone who has read theseries knows that to call it unfilmable is an understatement. It is agenre bending sci-fi western fantasy supernatural horror time traveltale that takes place in an interdimensional multi-verse that includesour own Keystone Earth with visits all over those other worlds. Evenknowing where to start filming this could take 6 months to debate. Thisisn't a perfect movie and it is going to mystify a lot of people thatneed everything explained to them or a box to put it in. A lot ofpeople will dismiss that as bad filmmaking. I thought they captured theessence of the story and laid down some good groundwork. It is a brisk95 minutes but it felt over 2 hours, and it is a rare film where thatis a compliment. I had LOW expectations. I've followed the making ofthis thing since the start and there have been some decisions thatwere... questionable. I walked away mildly impressed. And in this casethat is probably high praise. I won't be recommending it to anyone thatisn't familiar with the books. In short: I liked it, but I was willingto give it a chance. I hope it gets a sequel and they can start fillingin the worlds without all the exposition that was necessary to get thisone moving.
