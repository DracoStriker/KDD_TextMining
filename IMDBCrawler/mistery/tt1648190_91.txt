If you actually read and understood this series of books, you mustremember, there are so many worlds and possibilities attached to thetower. And in the book we learn Roland must begin his quest, again and,again, as he has before. Could this not be one version of his repeatedlife? With such a vast amount of worlds, would it truly be unthinkableto the possibility, that there other versions of these same people.This is still Stephen Kings created world. All things are possible, nomatter how crazy they may seem!It is a well done quick movie about The Gunslinger. The actors wereperfect. I honestly didn't feel cheated, because it leaves so much roomfor another one or two to fill in the remainder of the original story.
