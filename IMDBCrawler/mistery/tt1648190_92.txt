Comparing the books to a movie... It's like trying to compare aLamborghini to the Queen Mary. :) I loved the story, so having the anentire ark of many books roar past in 1 movie was great. But the shipwon't fit on a road so... if you go looking for the entire liner, itjust won't be there. The 6.0 out of 10 on IMDb I think reflects that,rather than how good the movie itself is.The movie is good. Elba and McConaughey do excellent work.
