When the movie was announced I had two reactions. The first one was "ohmy god! They will make an adaptation of one of my favorite books". Thesecond was "I hope they don't destroy it". Well they destroyed.Lets talk about this. When Stephen King wrote the books is visible howit grows along the many years he took to write it. The characters areall important and very well described. The universe is amazing and Iwas waiting an adaptation that reached the fantastic universe that Kingcreate.But the movie gave to us only a mix of elements from books 1 and 5. Thehistory is superficial and don't convince. They change so much Rolandthat I don't recognized him there in the screen. Besides I like thechoose of Idris for the paper he was not good there.The movie is to much fast different from the books and I can't believethey made this movie to short.What save the movie from a complete disaster was the young Tom Taylorand the expert Matthew McConaughey. As a King fan I hope they don't make a sequel for this until they bringus an adaptation fantastic as the books.Pros: Matthew McConaughey great in the skin of Walter Padick. Cons: mixof book elements without a good movie history.
