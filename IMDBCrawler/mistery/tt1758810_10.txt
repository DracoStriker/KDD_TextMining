other reviews critique based on Hollywood tropes and complain becausethey are missing. Instead the film strives, successfully, to evoke theatmosphere of Scandinavian Noire, while employing the story tellingtechniques of Knut Hamsun - no character development, no exposition,and entering the story mid-crisis. I wish it had been recorded inNorwegian so we could appreciate the conflict between Bergen and Oslo,so integral to the books. it's a mood film, not simply a whodunit.bringing in familiar USA actors was a clever red herring, but probablywon't be appreciated, and instead some will complain these actorsdidn't get more screen time. finally, the anti-tourism photography ofwinter instead served the story and was worth the price of admission tothe big screen view. Overall a needed antidote to the last 20 years ofexecrable USA superhero fare.
