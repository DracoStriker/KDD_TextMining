Differs from the typical fare with a nice steady build up of suspense,gives satisfying clues, and in the end wraps up the mystery. If you arelooking for Jigsaw, then this is not the film for you. I realize thatsome of the disappointed reviews were from folks who were hoping to befrightened. I personally have no love for shock value, and am neverfrightened by films. If i wanted to be scared, I would go watch Oprahor the Kardashians to be properly terrified at how absurdly stupid andinane the human race has become. Otherwise there isn't much a screencan do to terrify me. This isn't trying. It has the same goals as WindRiver, but it fulfills them better. Probably because Detective Harryisn't a blundering idiot. I am unwilling to give up the plot like someothers. I can say; nice pace, good story, not particularly original,but very well done. Exactly as it should be. Its not an art house film.Its a thriller mystery, and a engaging one.
