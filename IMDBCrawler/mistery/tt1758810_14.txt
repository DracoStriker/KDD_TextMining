Kinda tired of people giving low score for a movie because they don'tunderstand or they don't like these kinda movies yet they watch it orthey compare it to a book. First of all a book is a book. A movie is a movie. Don't watch thesetype of movies if you don't like them. If you don't understand it orthe connections or whatever it is that you don't understand, then it isa problem in your head. Not in the movie.Anyway. Usual crime story. OUTSTANDING CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SCORES! In the end that WIDE SHOT on the lake was INCREDIBLE!
