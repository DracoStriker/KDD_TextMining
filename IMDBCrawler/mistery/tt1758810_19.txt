The Snowman isn't nearly as bad as some might have you believe. Yes,it's set in Norway, and yes, the actors have or use English accents forthe most part, but it is an English-language movie, intended forviewing by people in countries where the English language is spokenwidely. Also, it's a nice change of pace, characters, story, andsetting from the stuff Hollywood normally shoves in our faces. Approachit with an open mind, and you'll probably be happy enough. Recommended.
