If you look at it as what it is: a movie inspired (not based on) by thebook then you will enjoy this crime/thriller movie. If you are a bigfan of the book you will be disappaointed, it seems to differ a lot.I don't know the book so for me and my girlfriend it was no problem andwe enjoyed it. Looking forward to first snowfall after this movie,superb cinematography of the white cold. Thank god you can't feel theblistering cold in a cinema ;-)
