I can't deny that I had high hopes for this film and it disappointed meon many levels, but I do think some of the previous reviews areexaggerating just how bad 'The Snowman' is. The film is messy, evenpuzzling at times, and very frustrating to watch. It lacks focus andstruggles to find its feet early on. It also contains some bafflingindividual scenes that contribute nothing to the plot or film as awhole.It improves as it goes along and, contrary to what a lot of others havesaid, I thought the ending was relatively well done. The film is moreof a mystery than a horror and it did keep me interested and guessinguntil the end... though I'm sure the stunning Scandinavian scenery didthe film a lot of favours in terms of watchability. 'The Snowman' isdisappointing, but it does have some pluses and is not as bad as someare making it out to be.
