It's as if PBS decided to do a "Silence Of The Lambs" progressivelyedgy and gory styled detective story with the pace and attention todetail of a "Father Brown" murder mystery or "The Coroner".Anyway, the production, cinematography and gorgeously orchestral andambient musical soundtrack are the winners in "The Snowman". Never hassnow looked so beautiful until you see it photographed in Norway.To keep up with the plot you do have to pay attention to all the namesof suspects, victims and time lines spoken abruptly in British accentswithin long contemplative pauses as if every character was avoidingbreathing the cold air.Val Kilmer is almost unrecognizable and his voice sounds dubbed whichkinda' makes his character oddly more interesting where I wish he wasgiven more screen time.It's a decent, intelligently and beautifully produced movie perfect forcurling up with some cocoa in cold winter months to find out who doneit. I was just expecting more "Silence Of The Lambs" and less"Inspector Morse".
