Based on Jo Nesbø's bestselling novel of the same name, this Oslo-setcrime thriller has everything working for it: a brilliant ensemblecast, a sublimely intelligent director, a gorgeously enigmaticlocation, and cracking source material. It's curious then, thatfilmmaker Tomas Alfredson?the genius behind Let the Right One In andTinker Tailer Solder Spy?has only managed a serviceable serial-killermystery, rather than the genre classic it could have been. The firstact does a terrific job establishing the bleak atmosphere, Norway'scapital shot as a perpetually sombre city ripe for the grim murdersbeing investigated by our drunken protagonist, Harry Hole (MichaelFassbender). Around the hour mark the plot, and the movie itself,starts to wither away; weird flashbacks to nine years earlier reveal aweak and unnecessary subplot, whilst Rebecca Ferguson's interestingsupporting character is inexplicably sidelined for the final act. Therequisite climactic rug-pull is present, however it's effectiveness isdampened due to rapidly waning interest levels and a lack ofunpredictability. The essential elements for greatness are here and fora while it seems like it's going to deliver, but ultimately The Snowmansquanders its potential to sit middle of the pack.
