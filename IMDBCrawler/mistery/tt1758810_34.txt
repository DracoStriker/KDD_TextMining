I've seen how much of a bad reception this film has received and Igenerally don't agree that it was as bad as its been made out to be.I'll start with the acting, this was top notch and the cast did anamazing job. Michael Fassbender put in a really good performance.The visuals and cinematography were great. It was wonderfully shot andthe locations looked beautiful.The soundtrack wasn't too bad, it built up the tension when it neededtoo.The one issue I've noticed people point out is that it feels like amess and the pacing isn't great. I agree with this to some extent. Atpoints in the movie it does feel a bit jumbled, but I feel like thiswas done on purpose, because some of this confusion is covered and madesense of in the third act.The third act is probably the best part of the film, the build up tothe conclusion was done well, and it leaves you on the edge of yourseat. However, the actual conclusion of the film, did leave a sourtaste in my mouth.If you like slow burner thrillers, then this is the film for you. It really isn't that bad.
