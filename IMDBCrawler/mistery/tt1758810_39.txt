It's apparent this film was made solely for fans of Jo Nesbø, as thestory is muddied with seemingly randomly chosen scenes and aspects ofthe novel and complete disregard and jettisoning of more importantparts of the tale, sure to confuse the average movie-goer. Fortunately,I have read all the novels in the series, so I understood all thebackground of the characters which was mostly skimmed over or poorlydisplayed.A real shame, because Jo Nesbø's books are incredibly layered andnuanced and keep you guessing. Whereas this movie changes much moreinteresting aspects of the original story to instead regurgitatetypical Hollywood thriller plot lines.On top of all that, they relegate a couple of semi-major andentertaining characters to nameless ones with a few meaningless linesin the film. And they didn't even pronounce the main character's namecorrectly. In Norwegian, "Hole" is pronounced "HOO-leh", a source ofhumor in a few of the books.The good and bad news is, this mess of a film likely nixes any chanceof it turning into a mediocre series.
