If you enjoy gruesome, gore, and horror this one's for you. Otherwise,the film's story is boring. It's just another who done it. There arefar too many characters introduced just to confuse, and you soon giveup trying to keep track. But, if you like winter and lots of snow andbeautiful scenes of Oslo and Bergen, Norway then that will distractfrom the rest of the film.
