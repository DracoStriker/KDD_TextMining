I saw "The Snowman", starring Michael Fassbender-Assassin's Creed, Bandof Brothers_tv; Rebecca Ferguson-The Girl On the Train,Mission:Impossible-Rogue Nation; J.K. Simmons-The Accountant, TheCloser_tv and Val Kilmer-MacGruber, Deja Vu. This movie is based on aseries of crime books about a detective named Harry Hole. The books arewritten by a Norwegian named Jo Nesbo. Michael plays Harry Hole, a manwith a past history of tragedy and addiction-in the form ofalcoholism-who solves crimes in Norway. Women start disappearing andtheir bodies are found later-usually dismembered-and a recently builtsnowman is nearby. Rebecca is Michael's partner. They realize they havea serial killer and clues lead to older cases. One of those older casesis shown in flashback, with Val as the lead detective. FYI: I know Valhas had some medical problems lately and you can tell here, with hisslurred speech and just his general movements and appearance. J.K.plays a businessman with some shady appetites for younger women. Thestory is not bad but it is a little jerky in places, as if some sceneswere left out. The whole movie is a little slow-paced, too. The movieends with a little hint that there might be a new franchise in theworks for Detective Harry Hole but unless the box-office reallysurprises me, I seriously doubt it. It's rated "R" for grisly images,language and sexual content- including brief nudity-and has a runningtime of 1 hour & 59 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but Iguess it would be alright as a rental.
