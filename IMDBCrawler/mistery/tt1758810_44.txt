I saw the film this past week. While the beginning seemed promising, itdragged. Not dragging partially, but the whole film dragged. Somethings in the movie were not necessary but seemed to be a time filler. The beginning of the film had an promising start... But the more itdragged and jumped around, the less interest I had in continuing. Thetrailer portrayed something different to me so I was disappointed inwhat it turns out to be. Though the story behind it was interesting. It took its time getting toa climax. I don't think I have ever wanted to get my money back on amovie. Definitely don't recommend seeing it in theaters unless its adollar theater, if you want to watch a scary film, this is not thefilm.
