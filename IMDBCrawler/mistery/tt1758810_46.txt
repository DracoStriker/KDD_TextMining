I'll watch anything with Michael Fassbender in it. But Snowman is aflop. I read the book by Jo Nesbo which was pretty good. The screenplayto Snowman doesn't adapt well to the book. Detective Harry Hole is on the hunt for a serial killer who's callingcard is a snowman. The film's plot is laborious and dreary. I didn'tconnect with any of the characters. I did a lot of other things whilewatching this film which is always a sign it's not that compelling. Fassbender does the best he can with the script but I really hope heholds out for roles worthy of his stellar acting ability.
