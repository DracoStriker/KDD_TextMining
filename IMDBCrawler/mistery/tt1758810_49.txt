I've waited impatiently for The Snowman to come out for the last fewweeks and I have to tell that I'm not impressed at all with what I saw.The movie should be based on the novel of Nesbo, but it was very faraway from the thriller and the twists in the book. We didn't see at allthe passion of Hoole, his obsession of finding the murderer. Thecharacters were presented very bad. I've read the book and the MouldMan has a very big role in the investigation of Harry Hole and infinding the murderer, and in this movie i believe the spectators didn'tget why was he in the motion picture at all.Many of the facts from the book were changed, and even the main reasonfor the murders and the illness of the Snowman were cut from the scriptand this gave completely different vision of the movie. In the book TheShowman kills his mother in a cold-blooded way, when he was a child andshe is his first victim, and in that way we realize how twisted andinsane he is, and here in the motion picture, we saw very differentthing in the beginning.And the way Katrine Brat thought that there is a connection between thesnowing, married women with kids and the murders - this was totallynonsense at all, it was kind of funny I can say. And in some moment sheshould be considered as the Snowman, but that part was out of thescript also.And the top moment of this film was the terrible ending when the killerfell in the ice out of nowhere. Who wrote this, and who approve it as away of murdering the Snowman?! This was absolutely bad, to put itmildly, even if they wanted to kill the Snowman, there were hundreds ofdifferent ways to do it much better, although this was not part of thebook ending, but when you cut the main reason from the plot this iswhat happens.I thing the norwegian cinema will present this book in a much betterway, so I hope that this will not be the last movie for this horrificthriller of Nesbo.
