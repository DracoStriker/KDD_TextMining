The movie has a rapid pace from the first 2 minutes. You start to haveideas of who can be the snowman and with each scene you will changeyour mind. Loved the fact that it's not that easy to understand theaction with back and forth pieces of the puzzle.Not many will understand it! But those who will will appreciate howstunning the scenes where created.
