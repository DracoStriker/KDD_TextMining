Jo Nesbo is one of my favourite authors and his Harry Hole series to meis just superb they way he has over time captured the very essence ofall the main characters especially their human frailties as well astheir brilliance.On seeing original trailer i was really looking forward to this filmversion of my favourite Jo Nesbo novel but at times it departs sogreatly from source material and there definitely appears to have beenmany re-shoots and cuts as a lot of main scenes in cinema trailer arenot even in the film.This could and indeed should have been superb considering strength ofsource material and the quality of the assembled cast and whilst icannot fault Michal or Charlotte as Harry & Katrina the whole film doesseem disjointed and i have no idea why they made significant changes tosuch a great story.Spoilers below so don't read further unless you want to knowIt appears although i cannot be certain because there is definitelyambiguity as to what actually happens with Katrina Bratt, is shemurdered by killer which is such a marked change from Harry Hole seriesi cannot for life of me fathom out why directors would take such a stepif they indeed are hoping to make further Harry Hole films.Katrina Bratt is such a key character to several of the novels and isstill alive and well in most recent one, as i said i am not 100% sureshe was murdered as may just have been still unconscious after killerdrugged her and removed her finger.Please do not judge Jo Nesbo's books especially the Harry Hole( Hol-leh) series which is superb. The Snowman is such a well written andcrafted book where you get a real sense of the genius of Harry'sdetecting Brain, his personal demons and the sexual chemistry betweenhimself and Katrina which is always lying just below the surface. Iguarantee that most people who are slagging film off would love thenovel so if you get a chance give it a read and see how good it is andwhat a waste of great material this film is.
