Sitting through this movie is like sitting in a doctors office justwaiting to be seen and finally when your seen your just completelyready to leave and forget what the hell you wasted your time in therethe first place. That's how I felt after getting out of this awfulpiece of trash where all I kept doing was waiting for this crap to end.I found this movie to be really boring, I tried sitting through thismovie somewhat interested but continually looked for something tofollow but then found that there's nothing to hang onto . The storydoesn't know what it wants to be so it throws all these scenes in placefor no reason. The acting is as boring as watching a couple of guyslaying on a bench where all you feel is when the hell are they going towake up, that's how uninteresting they are. If your going to see thismovie take some sleeping pills with you cause your missing nothingthroughout this and might gain more by taking a nap then sittingthrough this waste.
