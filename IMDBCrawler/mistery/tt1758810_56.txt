Incredible novel from great Norwegian writer Jo Nesbo has turned it'spages onto screen and once again book to movie adaptation suffers fromsame problems that always catch movies that try to portray charactersand action that happens inside book and minds of readers. Movie followsHarry Hole (Michael Fassbender) and Katherine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson)as they stumble upon mysterious killer that leaves snowman's whilekilling his victims. Michael Fassbender gives an interesting insightinto Hole's mind and his troubles but it seems as he was given toolittle to work with and he did a pretty good job in that. RebeccaFerguson (Katherine Bratt) was also a good part of movie as she triesto move and gives her best in everything but kept Harry at distancemost of time. Writers of the movie script took great project but as youhear the lines and dialogues it is obviously that something isn'tright. Director Tomas Alfredson (Let the right one in, Tinker TailorSoldier Spy) gives his view of Snowman and it was sometimes slick butmany many time choppy and just feeling that movie needs to projecthorror and fear was missing mostly, there are some great scenes andshoots but it seems that he just didn't know how to put it together.For the 119 min movie you will find last 20 minutes most entertainingand filled with everything that movie needed from the beginning becausethey are horrifying, tense and very greatly put together. There's a lotpeople that love Jo Nesbo and his work because it's filled with greataction, incredible mystery, stunning character evaluation and muchmore. Harry Hole as detective in all those books deserves the betterand proper portrayal because of potential that it could have in movieworld given how Snowman changed and messed with Harry which wasn't seenvery much in movie. In hope that movie won't get too destroyed andthere could a possible sequel with his next book like Leopard that evenmuch more to offer for filmmakers because this movie just might destroythat opportunity. 1.5/4
