I'm giving it a 4 because it wasn't completely worthless but stillpretty bad. First you need to really pay attention. I try to watch allmovies but it was really hard for me to keep trying to get into it.Acting was fine and story was a good concept and that's as far as itgoes. It was SLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW. Once you see and figure out what'sgoing on your kind of like "k hurry up and get to the end already". Sowait for this one to be on Netflix not worth seeing in the theater atall. I felt like the previews looked better than the actual movie. Itwas thrilling or fearful at all.
