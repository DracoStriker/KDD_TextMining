The first half of this movie is very slow moving. In fact, two peopleactually walked out of the movie and I almost fell asleep a few times.The acting was pretty good. This is one that I suggest waiting untilit's on DVD to watch. Both my husband and I walked out wishing we'dgone to see Tyler Perry's new Halloween movie instead.
