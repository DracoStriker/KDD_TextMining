This had its moments and at times it was akin to other Scandinavianthriller dramas such as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but it fellwell short and was not as complex as The girl on the train . The main problem with the story for me was that the conclusion held nosurprise which is the essential element of a good thriller . But as a visual treat it was good but the lack of local casting waspoor it felt watered down as a result and Val Kilmer's character couldhave been edited out and that would have enhanced the film ! It offered more it gave less . Pad.A 4/10
