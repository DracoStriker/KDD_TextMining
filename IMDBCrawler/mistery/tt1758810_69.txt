I was expecting something like Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. What I gotwas an incomprehensible mess. It just jumped around with no logic. Andthe subplots were simply diversions to make the movie longer. Take outall the nonsense and its only a short. Other reviews are more detailedbut simply put this movie s u c k s. And its not hate as one reviewerclaims its simple truth.
