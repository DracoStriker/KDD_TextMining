There are many issues with The Snowman. Fassbender is miscast and as aresult, his character of Harry Hole makes no sense. How is this greatdetective THIS MAN? What is even more difficult is that this film makesno sense in its two-hour format. This was a 500-page book condensedinto a predictable and nonsensical two hours. It is clear Scorsese feltthis should be a TV show and walked away when it could only be madeinto a film. Tomas Alfredson is great at making long, complicated worksmake sense (His Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was close to perfect) buteven using great screen adaptators like Peter Straughan cannot makethis work.The biggest issue is not the story, about women who are murdered andmutilated by a man using a Snowman as his MO, but the casting. Only thegenuinely Scandinavian actors work, such as Rebecca Ferguson, DavidDencik and Jonas Karlsson in their roles. Val Kilmer's presence isbaffling but he provides some of the most interesting scenes.It feels like a production with no vision and even Alfredson'ssignature style of being voyeurs as we look through windows becomesdull. It is a disservice to not only Jo Nesbo but all Scandi-Noir.
