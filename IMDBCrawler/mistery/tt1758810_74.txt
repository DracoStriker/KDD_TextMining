I was really looking forward to this movie, and who wouldn't? A moviedirected by Tomas Alfredson, starring Michael Fassbender & CharlotteGainsbourg, and executive produced by Martin Scorsese? SIGN ME UP! Man,was I utterly disappointed by how incredibly BORING this film turnedout to be. For some reason, I thought that this film was going to beabout a serial killer, but instead I got a PSA against Alcoholism.Seriously, it seemed like everyone in this film had a destructive vice,and focused way too much time and energy detailing each one. The"killer" doesn't even have much of a presence throughout the movie, an30 minutes into the movie. It was obvious, and anyone who was payingattention would have seen it coming from a mile away.The film was expertly shot, and the acting was phenomenal. But thescript was sub-par and so damn tame. Why make an R-rated movie aboutserial killers if you aren't going to go all out? You show rareglimpses of understanding why people like genre, but again, the movieultimately caters to sensitive sensibilities and people who don't wantto be bothered too much in watching a movie about someone who kills abunch of people. I mean, it's okay, as long as you don't really showit, amirite? I am angry I spent $30 to watch this (I went to the iPictheater). I am angry that I didn't read at least a few reviews. I amangry that I wasted an hour and a half of my life sitting through thismovie. 25 minutes in and you know if this movie is going to be for you.If you can't stop the movie and pic something else to watch, then youare wasting your time. I wouldn't even recommend it when they areshowing it on basic cable. It's just not worth it.
