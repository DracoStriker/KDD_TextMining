What do we get with a Fassbender movie....just a Fassbender movie.Can't understand why he keeps getting roles ( or Rollys ) . He's not abad actor..he's just so 1 dimensional and wet.i have not read the novel but I would imagine it's a brooding pageturner ...rather than this stuck together piece. That is a shamebecause it's got the making of a good thriller. Started OK and made methink...but then it just thawed out. There was people here who didn'tneed to be here..and the sub plots were just silly. I think it wasrushed . Tried to be a backdrop movie with some of the camera work but I wasuninterested with it all and felt confused. I'm sure the lead will behappy with his fee.My biggest gripe was the ending. Why, when he confronted the killerwith a wire around the womans throat, did he not just shoot him? JUSTSHOOT HIM!!Then when he fell through the ice the audience were justlaughing...shame all around..could have been great ..was not !
