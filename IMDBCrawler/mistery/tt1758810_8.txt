The original material the film is based on, "The Snowman" by Jo Nesbo,is a gripping thriller brilliantly composed with complex characters.However, this film adaption lacks everything. Frankly, there is verylittle left of the original story. The scriptwriters not only tamperedwith the plot, but altered characters as well. It is an entirelydifferent story that is badly constructed with gaping holes in theplot. Without having read the book, I'd imagine it would be slightly betterwith decent performances from the actors. Shame that had such an awfulscript to work with.
