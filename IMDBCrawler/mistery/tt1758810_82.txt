I haven't been THAT bored in a movie theater in a long time. This filmis disorganized, choppy, and seems to not even know what story it wantsto tell. At some point (VERY early on) I no longer cared anyway. Remaining dislikes:Long and underwhelming - I really just wanted them to find the killerso I could go home. Missed character development opportunities - Mainly with antagonistHarry Hole played by Fassbender. His character just exists... andsometimes he does stuff. The way he goes about life seems kind ofstrange but you have no idea why he lives like that.The detectives just make lots of dumb decisions and put themselves inunnecessary danger.The villain was cliché, weak, and did I mention cliché?The climax/end was amateurish and silly Val Kilmer randomly shows up looking like a drunk version of TheGodfather.... his character's behavior is strange.The only exciting scenes were in the trailer and none of them foundtheir way to the movie.This wasn't good at all. I don't recommended it. Not now, not ever, noton redbox, nextflix, or TNT. Just pass... unless you need something toput you to sleep.Follow me on Twitter @MovieBuffChick1 Find me on YouTube for audioreviews https://youtu.be/5xOh2QFy0c0
