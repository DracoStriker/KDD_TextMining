The 'acid test' of what is, or is not, a 'good film' is (in my opinion)is the question: Would you watch it again? - For 'the snowman' the answer is aresounding NO This is trying to be a clever 'physiological thriller' and fails, andfails badly. It is clumsy, clunky, predictable and disjointed. It is hard to believethis was made by professional film makers. Fassbender and co, are good actors, excluding a barely recognisable ValKilmer who was cringeworthy as some 'great' alcoholic detective. Apredecessor to Harry Holes (Fassbender) Norway definitely has analcoholic unsupervised irresponsible cop problem. A cast desperately in search of a good script, (or a plausible murderor murderer.) I can only presume the 'good script' was lost in an avalanche andburied deep in the Norwegian snow never to be found. So the film makershad to cobble together this ragtag montage of plot holes and WTF?moments e.g. Fassbender goes upstairs in a small wooden house, gundrawn looking for the bad guy. Here's phone, sees it's a decoy. Comesdown stairs again and baaaam - 2 hostages are now sitting tied tochairs in the kitchen (where fassbender was only 2 minutes previous)with the bad guy with a garrot machine ready. How? What is it Star Trek and they were beamed down? He carried them inone under each arm? Ridiculous as the ice that conveniently cracks atthe end and a guy with a gun being chased by an unarmed man. Some nice views of Norway though ! 4/10 seriously don't both
