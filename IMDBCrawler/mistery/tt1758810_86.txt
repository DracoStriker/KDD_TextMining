What went wrong? That's what I want to know. What happened? This moviehad everything going for it. It had an amazing book (I'm a massive JoNesbo fan; he must be furious about this movie) as the source material,a talented director and a seriously strong cast. It had all theingredients to be an awesome Nordic-Noir thriller. How couldn't it be?Now, I'll start by saying that this is a watchable film for the mostpart. It's got plenty of lovely shots of Norway, one of the mostbeautiful countries out there in my opinion, and the requisite thrills,shocks and turns throughout most of the film. Don't get me wrong; thecharacters are cold and it's never scary, but at least it'sinteresting. All of the mostly English and American actors do fine(Well, mostly anyway) and speak with convincing Scandinavian accents,which was very helpful in getting us to accept that everyone in Norwaysuddenly speaks English the whole time. Then, then- then- comes,honestly, the worst finale of a film of this kind I've ever seen. No,I'm serious. The villain's reveal makes no sense, his psychology isn'texplored, there's no tension, action or anything really resembling astand-off and then one short scene later the film ends out of nowhere.Seriously, what were they thinking? The book had an awesome finale onthe Oslo ski jump for crying out loud! By the looks of it, judging byall the unresolved subplots, terrible editing and complete lack ofcoherence, the causes of this failure must be either studiointerference or 3 different people with different ideas writing thescript. Seriously though, what happened? Also, this is the first timeI've ever been bored by Michael Fassbender... and Harry Hole is such agreat characters in the books! Poor Jo Nesbo. Still, hopefully someoneelse will do the books justice. Speaking of which... note to the makersof this film: It's Harry Hoo-lee not Harry Hole! 4/10
