The Snowman features effective Mise en Scene that forces the viewer tofeel the cold and foreboding nature of not only a Norwegian winter, butof the beast itself. Tones of blue accentuate the season and the soundof crunching snow provides effective sensory stimulation to get thevision across.Cinematography is straightforward and effective. I feel the framing isneither uninspired nor radical. The story, however, is long and drawn out. Names are quickly andcasually thrown about and then not mentioned, only to resurface 20minutes later. What is the mystery here, where is this story going? isa question I found myself asking 45 minutes into the 120 minute film.Character motives aren't well defined until the end, an idea that worksfor antagonists but serves to confuse the viewer when it comes to thedetectives and the children.Sadly, I found myself fighting to stay awake after 70 minutes of "TheSnowman". I feel that critical reviews comparing it to "The Silence ofthe Lambs" are wholly misleading and built expectations beyond what thedirector was able to deliver.Awarded 4 of 10 stars for effective use of sound, lighting, and mise enscene to bring the viewer into the frigid world of mid-winter Norway.
