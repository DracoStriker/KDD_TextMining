. . . America with THE SNOWMAN, carefully crafted to show what's instore for us as we teeter on the Precipice of TrumpCare. The Basic Plotof THE SNOWMAN is that a fiendish demon (played by J.K. Simmons)already has assumed control of a backward frozen wasteland dubbed"Norway," and instituted TrumpCare. The institution of TrumpCare ishighlighted by Sadomasochistic "Plastic Surgeons" like "Mathias" makinghouse-calls upon any uppity women who've ever had or are thinking ofhaving abortions. These TrumpCare Specialists then sneak into the homesof such defenseless females. Their doctors' bags contain specializedpower tools designed to nip of ladies' heads, fingers, feet, and otherappendages with the least muss possible. The TrumpCare givers thendisplay these patients' noggins in Public Places, as a warning toanyone else expecting the Government to take care of their Pregnancies.Universal's release of THE SNOWMAN is especially timely now, as StageOne of TrumpCare is FORCING three dozen teen gals in Texas to havebabies in prisons under HANDMAID'S TALE rules, according to a report onMSNBC Oct. 20, 2017.
