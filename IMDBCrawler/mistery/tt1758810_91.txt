As a big fan of horror and crime movies, especially the ones that areset in Nordic countries, which usually guarantees for a specialatmosphere, this movie left me disappointed, bored and exhausted.With such a brilliant cast and having the very successful novel by JoNesbø as a background, expectations were high. And indeed, the filmwork itself, having Dion Beebe behind the camera and Thelma Schoonmakeras a cutter is good, but it simply doesn't compensate for a plot thatmassively lacks integrity, for bland and shallow characters whoseactors would've offered so much more potential, for a complete lack ofthrill and for inconsistencies on all levels. They even missed thechance to show a victim actually fighting for their life - the snowmanis obviously prepared for everything.The trailer pretty is pretty much reduced to every thrilling momentthis movie is offering, the snowman itself (now talking about theactual fella made of snow) doesn't really play a major role at all,it's almost cringeworthy to see it randomly stand somewhere at a crimescene, but in the movie it appears completely irrelevant to the storyitself. Obviously, the snowman was supposed to be a signature similarto Jigsaw's clown mask or the stick dolls that represented the presenceof the Blair Witch, but after all it seemed to me that it was just arandom pick and after all it doesn't play any role other than makingfor a tired laugh in the audience whenever a grim snowman can be seenpeaking through the window.There was a lot of potential - interesting characters with backgroundstories, a great setting with a dark and hibernal Norwegian landscape,but the director completely wasted it.I've seen thousands of movies but this one was the first one ever thathad me fall asleep and that made people leave the theater before itfinished. I also never observed so many people from the audience leaveto take a toilet break or have a smoke because they quickly noticed howthe movie just makes the chance of missing something important so smallafter a certain point.My final rating is 3/10 - 2 points for great filming and photographyand the effort. It would be OK for watching at home on a dark winterevening, having a hot cup of tea and some distraction to sit throughit. But definitely not worth going to the cinema to see it.
