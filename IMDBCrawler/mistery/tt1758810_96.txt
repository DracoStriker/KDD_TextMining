When you make a crime-mystery-thriller, there are a few things you mustdo if you want to keep your audience attentive. Pace the film where thethrills are present enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, makethe crime(s) impactful enough to care for the characters involved, andcreate a mystery that questions every turn that every character makes.The Snowman doesn't do a single one of those things.I saw the review scores before I spent my 2 hours on this film, but Ilove Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson enough to give them thebenefit of the doubt and support their acting choices. Unfortunately,it's not them where the problems lie. Both of them are equallyserviceable in their respected roles, however, the direction isabsolutely lackluster to say the least. I haven't seen TomasAlfredson's other films, but they have been acclaimed by the viewers.After seeing The Snowman, it seems like he just had no interest intelling a cohesive and well-thought out crime film. The film is overlyconfusing and lacks anything of interest to keep the plot going.Typically, it's make or break in terms of the lead serialkiller/villain in these types of films. The "Snowman Killer" containsone of the laziest and nonsensical twists/reveals I have seen in quitesome time. As if the movie wasn't frustrating to that point, the momentyou find out who is pulling the strings really puts the moviecompletely over the rails.As with most bad films, I don't like wasting much energy on them, soall I'll say is that this film is a complete waste of time andopportunity. Talented actors and others are involved in the making ofThe Snowman, and it doesn't seem like anybody cared to bring their A-game.3.0/10
