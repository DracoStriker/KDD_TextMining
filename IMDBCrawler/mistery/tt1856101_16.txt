I always gave the original Blade Runner 10/10. Seen it a over a 1000times including at the movie theater. Good pace, visuals, music,likable characters, bad guys. Yup, pretty much everything. One of mytop 10 movies of all time. This review for 2049 is not because itshould be the same thing or make it over the top.OK now this Blade Runner 2049. Bad boring. Where nothing really meansmuch. Unlikable characters, music is "meh" nothing unique(A poorversion of the original_. Bad people in this, who cares? Bring us backwith someone who is actually a threat(like Roy). We have some stupidterminator woman who really just flat out sucks. Poor casting. JaredLeto sucks. Yeah, he really does. Then you have the black guy with acane from walking dead, who talks to everyone sideways. Who talks topeople sideways? Why did you cast him? I've never see someone in anyother movie, show or real life talk to people when they are not lookingat them. Fail!!! I thought it was stupid in walking dead and now itsreally stupid. Plot is blah. Oh, it's also like a journey for RyanGosling to go from one Cameo to another with another boring scene. Notmuch vocab, emotion. Even Roy in the original had TONS of emotion andeven had poetry at the end when he decided to turn a corner and savelife instead of destroying everything in his path.Harrison Ford is just an old man in this(sorry to say). Think it's timeto retire. Did nothing in this film except hold a gun in Ryan's faceand get captured with handcuffs.Do not believe the hype, not a good movie.
