What a disappointment, so much hype and, therefore, expectation butthis is no more than a competent sci-fi film, certainly not a worthysuccessor to the original. I could support a 163 minute run time ifthere was plenty of content but at times it felt like the actors weremoving and speaking slowly not for effect, but to fill in the gaps. Asfor the plot, everything revolved around the ability or otherwise ofreplicants to breed. If you have the technology to grow a human bodyfrom scratch and implant whatever memories you want I'd have thoughtintroducing the mechanics of reproduction wouldn't be difficult. Icould go on but really, this film isn't worth the bother.
