The title says it. Here goes: Prior to release the critiques areoverwhelmingly positive and make out the sequel to be the secondcoming! It turns out there is either payola going on or the studio hasphotos of some people.The day before and on the day of release IMDb fills up with perfect'viewer' reviews of said film propelling the sequel to IMDb 250 list.All these, er, reviewers believe this film is perfection with not evena speck of imperfection. 10/10 i.e. nothing at all could be in any waybetter! The sequel was in actuality unrequested and unwanted.The sequel sets itself up for even more sequels with unresolved orcliff hanger plots.I do have to confess that I found the actresses in 2049 sexy and worthfantasizing about. Those were the real tens here and so I cannot giveBR2049 a mere 1, which is something TFA deserves. Obviously Ridley andVilleneuve are better crew than JJ Abrams and whoever Disney hires, butit has to be said that BR2049 was a disappointment and I wish it werenot made. The bar was set so high to begin with.
