Let me describe the sequence of Blade Runner 2049 for youHere goes:Enter the cinema with an overpriced orange juice that is mandatorybecause in the last couple of years Hollywood has decided it is artsyand de rigueur to make films longer than 2 hours. The lights dim andcommercials kick in for 10 minutes. A game for pre-teens wastingdaddy's money on mobile phones and plans kicks in. 2 minutes ofendorsements for GM trucks (with some guy whose tone is so macho I rollmy eyes) follows. Then there is a reminder to get the right debit cardto be hip and in. Then the film follows for a whopping 3 hours almost. You would think that there was a lot happening and we were keptexcited. Alas, the only thing that kept me awake was the veryperiodical appearance of a beautiful eye candy whether real, hologramor laser show version that would keep things exciting.If it were not for the sexy and lovable women Blade Runner 2049 wasinane. Yes, inane. Apparently, not every film needs a sequel, a lessonHollywood didn't learn from Hangover.The script was so corny and the words so elementary one would beexcused for thinking this is a practical joke. Head of police, yes headof police is told a big lie by a contractor, head of police believes itand all is good. No double checking, no verifying, no details asked noproof required. it is a matter of life and death for the order of theworld and, of OK, let's keep rolling guys. The ending was also a joke.A vehicle is drowning and the hero is being drowned but in the lastsecond kills the bad gal and swims back to the vehicle to mount arescue (for the sequels that will follow). Replicants can have and makebabies, but how? Oh well, watch the prequel Blade Runner Rogue Uno,which is coming out in 2020.At that point all I wanted in life was to buy my own Joi and Luv and goback home.
