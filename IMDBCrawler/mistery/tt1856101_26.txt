In the ongoing tradition of Harrison Ford's Action heroes of the 1980'sturning out to be really terrible dads, we have Blade Runner 2049, thesequel to 1982's Blade Runner. We meet a replicant cop named K who is of a new variety that doesn'trebel unlike those bad ones in the movies. So he tracks down a RunawayNexus 8, even though in the original movie, we were assured that Nexus8's only had 4 year lifespans. During the course of this, they discoverthe bones of Sean Young's character from the original movie, along withthe realization she had given birth. Our hero also has a relationship with a Hologram Girl for some reason.I guess so he is sad when she gets deleted later in the movie. If you are watching this movie to see Harrison Ford reprise his role asDeckard, you don't get to see him walking around like someone'sconfused grandpa until 2 hours into an interminably long movie.(Seriously, I feel bad for Ford. Why does he do this to himself?)So they want to find the child of Deckard and Rachel because this is areplicant that can reproduce, which is supposedly more efficient thanjust growing them, for some reason. They say they need more replicantsto colonize the outer colonies, but of course, there are plenty ofpeople living in squalor, including a child labor sweatshop. I can't emphasize enough how long, boring, uninteresting this moviewas. It's like they watched the original and still had no idea whatmade it a good movie.
