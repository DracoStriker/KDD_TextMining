All the problems with the original theatrical version of Blade Runner,which Scott Ridley fought against are here. Ridley has become thestudio system.Blade Runner 2049, likely the least desired sequel in history, ismaking Philip K Dick roll in his grave. What is the point of thisalmost three hour-long sequel? Of course, it is to continue the filmindustry's addiction to sequels and make cash. That is it.Let me get this straight: the world is devastated and anyone who isanybody moves off-world, but people are living in spacious luxury in acasino drinking fine aged Scotch? There is beautiful white snow fallingfrom the skies and sexy call girls approach you on the street? Thisworld is for schmucks, but the main character has an artificialgirlfriend with legs to die for waiting at home for him making dinnerand giving him threesome sex? Someone book me a ticket back fromoff-world to Earth please!This was the kind of logical misstep that Ridley fought against whenthe studio released BR to cinemas with a gorgeous drive through thecountryside at the end of the original. It makes no sense.Face it, this is the film that should not exist and by watching allthese 'franchise' films we feed the stupidity of Hollywood.BR2049 is the same as the last 10 marvel films, the next ten Star Warsfilms and the Ghostbusters sequel, but is prettier and more visual.
