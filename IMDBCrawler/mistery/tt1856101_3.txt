Blade Runner (1982) was a happy (yet gloomy) accident, involving: a) ayoung and ambitious director who fought ferociously with studioexecutives in order for them to let him fulfill his vision; b) a risingblockbuster star who wanted to prove he can also act in a seriousmovie; c) a crazy Dutch actor who decided to change the script andimprovise one of the most memorable monologues in film history; d) abunch of talented artists who wanted to make a movie that would lookand sound different from anything else we had seen before. And most ofall, e) a post-Vietnam turbulent era when Hollywood rebels likeCoppola, Scorsese and Cimino were audaciously attempting to reinventthe language of cinema, telling stories that mattered and not caring atall about target audiences and marketing trends. As a result, BladeRunner was a box office failure that slowly became a legend, breakingstereotypes like "good guy kills bad guy at the end" and dealing withexistential agony on an almost metaphysical level; always within thecontext of a gritty corporate dystopia in the near future.Blade Runner 2049 is none of these things. On the contrary, it's theflawed triumph of a next generation of studio executives, who controlthe creative process by paying millions to the industry's best of thebest, providing they will make something that will take advantage of asuccessful brand name in order to bring profits to shareholders. Ifthere is one word to describe this movie, it's "replicant". Not thekind of replicant who realizes that "all those moments will be lost intime, like tears in rain" as he dies, but a sleek, expensive andobedient skin-job that will try to entertain you and if it succeedswill return as a sequel that will eventually become yet anotherfranchise. I spent 160 minutes of my life watching a pleasant andperfectly constructed piece of nothing, and I didn't care for a momentabout any of the characters or a storyline that was designed withoutthe intention to question and redefine a single thing. All its momentshave already been lost in my memory, while the original Blade Runnerremains vivid in my mind, as if I only saw it yesterday.
