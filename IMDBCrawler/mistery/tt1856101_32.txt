This was a disappointing sequel that may very well break the camel'sback. For it is not just a poor and boring sequel, but also destroys -really disrupts and breaks - the Blade Runner mythos.If I were the monthly new Marvel movie, the annual ritual of a stupidStar Wars film or the next fifteen Justice League whatever films Iwould be very worried.Blade Runner 2049 is telling people definitively that these sequels arenot made for reason of meaning, entertainment, purpose or a fun time.They are stupidly overwrought, prequel-crushing accounting ledgerlines.Ridley destroyed Alien and now is dismantling Blade Runner. Villeneuvehad three hours to do something and did not. This film addressesnothing and resolves nothing. In fact, they took our money and reachedzero conclusions. Replicants were made with a uterus in the factory andcan have babies (despite the later models' shelf lives)? How? Nevermind. The corporation was banned, but another like it and worse wasborn. Erm, OK. The tycoon megalomaniac is out there. Well, fine. Thisis a post apocalyptic world? yeah, which is why there are grandbuildings with no one around full of beautiful space, there is cleansnow falling and you can get beautiful attractive hookers who approachyou for a good time.I want to thank my dear girlfriend for being so kind as to sit throughthree hours of this joke with me. She is so noble. Otherwise, this filmwas so silly that it even tarnishes the original. It should not havebeen done. It will probably wake up people to skip the next Star Wars,Star Trek, Marvel whatever, Justice League, Lego Movie 18, whatever.A few cool technologies, sexy desirable women with gorgeous eyes andlovable legs and nothing else whatsoever except loads of damage toBlade Runner.
