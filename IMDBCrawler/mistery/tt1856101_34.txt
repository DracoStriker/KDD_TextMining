Plenty of raving reviews, but I do not agree with the masterpieceverdict by many reviewers. The original was complex, but yet simple tounderstand, and as the plot unfolds, the story engages you through thefilm. This sequel looks fantastic , and the performances are great, yetsomething is missing. A straight forward plot, with a flowing scriptwould have a made a huge difference. Sitting through 150 minutes ofdrama, yet struggling to make sense of it, seems to me that the makerfailed in the business of screen story telling. I was disappointed andfound the first film so much better than this big budget fare. Daltontrumbo please help us as today's science fiction big budget films arein the main failing to be anything like as entertaining as they shouldbe. Better script writers & screen story tellers are so important,yetit seems that simplicity is being substituted by muddled messy bigbudget effects, all for the sake of being so much cleverer than thedumb audience. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a film, a pity a fewof these over hyped directors, don't have a rethink on what it takes toentertain an audience . I am more than ever mistrusting so calledmaster reviewers !!!!
