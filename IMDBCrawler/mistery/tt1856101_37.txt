I'll keep it short, unlike the unnecessarily long movie. It's simplytoo boring. The whole movie, the story can actually be done and dustedwithin less than an hour if it wasn't unnecessarily extended anddragged on, and if the characters weren't always moving so inexplicablyslow.Sure the visuals and cinematography is great, but a movie isn't just aphotography slideshow, or a TV demo. I mean, had it been called thatbeforehand we would all know that's the only thing we're in for.Also learnt for the last time not to trust the reviews anymore,especially for new releases. I've seen time and time again that it'snot as reliable as it used to be. I predict the rating will fall intime (actually has since I've seen it). Back to pre-internet days whereword of mouth is more reliable.
