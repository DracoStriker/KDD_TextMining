Has this world gone insane? Are you all mad? Is it madness or are yourdeeds making me feel it is a crazy world? People are blowing each otherup, presidents are blatantly lying in people's faces and getting theirvote, ministries are making war and being called Ministry Of Defense,companies are polluting the planet and getting richer and on and on andon.Here comes a sequel for a classic of cinema that is currently ratedhigher than its original. The professional critics dutifully accordingit superlative reviews is not a surprise. The weekly release of a newMarvel movie gets the usual high reviews from this bunch, which tellsme they are on the take. How does one explain the 10/10 perfect reviewson IMDb? Do these reviewers actually believe this is the absoluteimmaculate and perfect film with nothing in it that could be improvedin any way?? I would accept this world as a more sane place if you tellme this is a case of fake shill reviews paid for by the studio (ashappened with Star Wars The Force Awakens and others). That I wouldbelieve and (sadly) understand. Otherwise, is there someone who reallythinks this sequel is better than the original and is perfect?? Thisfilm deserves 2/10 for its images and graphics and not much else. Thewomen are eye candies for sure so add another point, but otherwise theinferior music that goes off for no reason, the non-ending that issurely an attempt to set up more sequels and inane dialogue are a shameto the name Blade Runner.Were the makers able to get away with using the name because Philip KDick has died and cannot stop them?
