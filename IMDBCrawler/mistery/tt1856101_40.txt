These are my opinions, but many around here agree with me so pleasehear me out.I am not going to pose or be pretentious. I am going to be honest andsimply lay it on the line.Here goes;The good: I am a Blade runner fanatic. The DVDs (yes, more than oneedition) are sitting to my right as I type this. The original was justthat: original and deep. The futuristic vision, the subplots and thetheme were fantastic. Vangelis' score was once-in-a-life-time. I reallyliked BR2049's graphics and how big the effects were. The colourpalette was impressive and made us feel in awe. I am a man so I likewomen's skin. beautiful women do it for me. My girlfriend knows it, Iknow it, my friends know it. Beautiful women make me happy.The bad: we just do not need any more sequels, prequels and spin offs.We really do not. yet, that is all you are releasing. Even a generalfavourite like Blade Runner does not need its own sequel. Yes, grantedwe went for it, but seriously get a grip. We do not believe positiveprofessional reviews anymore. We learnt that lesson with The ForceAwakens. Not one professional reviewer mentioned that it is an inferiorreboot. Finally, your films are becoming longer and longer. What iswith the 2-hour plus movies that have become longer? Couple that withthe twenty minutes of commercials (didn't I just pay you? why do I haveto pay more with my time?) you force on me I am tempted to stay at homeand skip the cinema.Think about it.
