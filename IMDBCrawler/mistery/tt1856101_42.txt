This film tells the story of a modified, manufactured man who huntsdown and kill old versions of manufactured men. The discovery of asecret makes him re- evaluate his life and values.It is unfortunate that"Blade Runner 2049" is so desperate to impressedwith great lighting, to the point that it ignores the story. Scenesdrag on several times the length needed to tell a story, making thefilm overly long. The first hour already felt like eternity, and thenext 100 minutes were even longer. People in the cinema were restless,head resting on hands or just looked at the ground because it was soboring. The story was thin, and could have been told in a short time.Even the drowning scene had no sense of thrill, urgency or threat. Itis simply plain boring.
