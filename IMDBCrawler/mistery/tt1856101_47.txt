As someone I know said, this is a "cargo cult movie". It has all theexterior of what a great Blade runner sequel would look like but thereis little underneath. Visuals are stunning, music and sound are good, camera work is as itshould be, but when you get down to its core, there's little there. Iam not usually the one to complain about a slow pacing or a plot thatrequires some suspense of belief, but here It seems they serve as a wayto achieve the deep and philosophical feel without actually beingeither. Acting overall is mediocre at best, actors fail to convincinglyrelay emotion of the characters, that are themselves written quiteshallow, unrelatable and one dimensional. There are some interestingquestions raised by the plot, the whole thing is far from a totaldisaster, but nothing is explored deep enough or clearly enough to betruly interesting or engaging. That's why this movie is going to beremembered just as a sequel to it's famous original.
