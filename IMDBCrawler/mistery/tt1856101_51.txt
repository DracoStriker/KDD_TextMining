I loved original but I have to say I really hated this one. From moviemusic score to plot and cinematography - everything was adisappointment. The music score (loud noise) and cinematography wasespecially heavy handed in trying to force drama when it was notwarranted by plot. Instead of so much CGI producers should have spentsome $ on a better script and director. A bad movie should not be thislong, people walked out at my showing.
