The answer? Don't Do It In The First Place!Who needed a Blade Runner sequel? Nobody! It is like watering the sea.It is not required!! What is wrong with the studios? Everything iseither a sequel or a reboot. Boooooring. Find another line of work ifyou are out of ideas. As much as this film (Blade Runner 2049) was a relatively good film itstill was a sequel, which meant it was boring, silly, disjointed andregardless of all the good reviews was a waste of money. As forprofessional film reviewers: your job first and foremost is to reviewfor the audience and not to be beholden to studios that offer you freescreening. Shame on you.This film was nice to look at, had a good actor (Gosling) in it and areally hot chick which were factors that drew me in. When I put my bumin the seat though I was bored. Booooring. There is no ending and thebeginning makes zero sense! The tycoon is making replicants but iskilling the ones already there. Blade Runner is retiring replicants,but they are useful and peaceful. Rachel is back (yup its Boring Wars:the face awakens all over again) via CGI, but why? Nobody knows.
