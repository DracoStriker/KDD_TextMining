There's no disputing 'Blade Runner 2049' looks good - the vast decayingLA megalopolis, its futuristic interiors and surrounding desertwasteland are all portrayed with beautiful cinematography - butunfortunately the narrative arc doesn't match up to the scenery. Thissequel starts off on a familiar note - just like detective Rick Deckardin the original movie, a replicant police officer called 'K' tracksdown and terminates unreliable earlier models. During one of his operations, K digs up evidence of the possible birthof a replicant child - and after getting debriefed at LAPD, he'sreassigned to find this offspring. K's new mission obliges him to do alot of zigzagging around the dystopian landscape in his flying policecruiser. He asks awkward questions and delves into the archives at thereplicant manufacturing corporation, an orphanage and a memory-creationlaboratory. Occasionally K stops by his cramped apartment where hecarries on an unsatisfying love affair with his hologram girlfriend.The detective work seems unnecessarily opaque and long-winded, eventhough it's punctuated by some sporadic violence. The clues eventuallylead toward the legendary fugitive figure of Deckard, but it becomesincreasingly difficult to connect emotionally or intellectually withK's investigations and discoveries. The lasting impression - despitethe film's visual impact, blockbuster budget and continuing referencesto the Theseus myth - is that it's all rather underwhelming.
