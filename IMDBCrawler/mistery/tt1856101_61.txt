This film had so much potential. It has great acting, wonderful andinnovative special effects, lavish and imaginative environments, uniquescience fiction elements, it feels realistic, the music and tone arespot on, the cinematography is the kind you can watch for days... theyonly forgot story, and unfortunately that's kind of important. I was secretly hoping that they would have gone back to the sourcematerial, the original source material: the novel "Do Androids Dream ofElectric Sheep." The themes explored in that book are compelling andfascinating and include morality, religion, and what it means to behuman. The original "Blade Runner" adopted some of these themes. Thisfilm abandons them. Because of that, it feels soulless, nothing but apantomime of the original.I think that the primary plot failing is that "Blade Runner 2049" laysitself bare. We know right from the start who is a replicant and who ishuman. This strips out the heart of what (to me) makes Blade Runnerspecial: the questioning of what it actually means to be human and thejuxtaposition of humans acting like androids and androids acting withselfless humanity. Very little of that is to be found in this film.Walking out, I was left scratching my head at what themes they actuallywere trying to get at here. None are readily apparent. So it ends upbeing a cool looking, atmospheric action/sci-fi flick. That's makes ita good movie, but doesn't make it a "masterpiece."People still talk about the original "Blade Runner," 30 years afterit's release. Nobody will be talking about this movie when the year2049 actually rolls around.
