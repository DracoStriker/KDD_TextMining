God it's bad, I kept looking for the fast forward button. This showcouldn't get worse unless you just took a bunch of stills and looked ateach for 5 min. Even the ending is slowed to a crawl, or was it my skinthat crawled. A very hard to understand storyline, but the fact that itstretched scenes so you had to watch, with painful background music,with no action or dialogue was awful!!
