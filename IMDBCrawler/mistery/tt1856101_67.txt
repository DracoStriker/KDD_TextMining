I came I saw I yawned... wait no.. I cried... =/Blederuner was originally spat on and became a cult classic because itwas(and still is: visionary!) So they thought: If we try to makesomething look like it.... it will be just as good. Not..But I really tried to like it.. at a certain point I was evendesperately trying to convince myself that it might not be as bad and Ishould get of the stool and get the noose off, just don't think of itas a blade runner sequel I thought.... didn't work.Harisson Ford is the actual Decker, he brings his game. 1 point forhim. The, far too short, appearance of Mr. Edward J. Olmos makes itconnect. 1 point for him. Some of the music fits because its from theol' classic. 1 point.Whatshisname.... o yeah Ryan Goshling is as bad as he is in: "TheDriver" or worse.. if that is possible. no skills.. nothing.. If youthink that might make him a good replicant..perhaps.. just not any goodto watch.. if he played a beverage dispenser somewhere.. perhaps..probably not.A lot/too much of very pretentious cinematography with extermely drawnout scenes that add absolutely nothing and last way too long... A scenethat resembles the never ending story sphinx scene is possibly one ofthe worst. The entire movie could be a great short, if edited to therelevant 20 minutes. The rest is utter crap. There is a very old game Ibet you can still find online with VGA graphics that you will enjoy1000X more than this attempted cash cow.You ass-wipes! Shame on you. Mac
