boring, slow, long movie that feels long in a bad way, bad payoff,unless you're a og fan who wants nostalgia it may be fine. the theatrei was in most movie goes i asked did not enjoy it. Jared Letoscharacter wasn't needed unless its for a sequel, his side kick was onlyneeded at the end, honestly 30-45 minutes could have been cut andnothing would really changed film wise. Harrison ford stated and imparaphrasing, you can watch the movie as a sequel or stand alone, Idon't agree with that. ending was a let down, Deckard finally sees hisdaughter hand on glass, end..... really wouldn't recommend to anyonebut thats my opinion. If you enjoyed it, happy for you.
