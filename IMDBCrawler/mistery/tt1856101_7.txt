Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic BladeRunner. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) and once againbased on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,it successfully recaptures just about everything excellent about theoriginal and is a superb sequel to one of the greatest and mostimportant science fiction films of all time.Thirty years after the events of the first film, LAPD Officer K (RyanGosling) works as a Blade Runner, retiring old rogue replicants(artificial humans) hiding out around the Los Angeles area. One daywhile on a job, K discovers a long buried secret in the yard of areplicant which leads him on a journey to track down former BladeRunner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been missing for decades.Featuring amazing visuals and some of the most philosophical andthought-provoking themes since the original, Blade Runner 2049 is amasterpiece of science fiction and is possibly one of the greatestsequels ever made. I was transfixed the entire time, to the point whereI felt that even blinking would cause me to miss something I wanted tosee. The cast was brilliant as well, especially Ryan Gosling, who doesa fantastic job carrying the film as its lead actor. However, perhapsbest of all, is that seeing the original is not a requirement to fullyunderstand everything that is going on, although it would probablystill help to have done so beforehand. I'm almost certain that authorPhilip K. Dick would be proud of this film. I know I am.I rate it a very high 9.5/10
