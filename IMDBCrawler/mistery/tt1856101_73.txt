It's so boring I would fall asleep two or three times if the music wasnot too loud. Sound mixing is a disaster. The only reason I did notleave the theater was that the story always had something above thethreshold minimum to stay. Too many pointless scenes. Even pointlessviolence. And for God's sake, what's the point of the ending?? Is thisall from the sequel of a masterpiece: to die for the good purpose?Really? It's so weak that it hurts. The only positive thing about themovie that it tries very hard to respect the first one, that's why Igave two stars. But it's way too superficial.Ps.: For the professionals: It's time to learn to create an atmospherewithout so much color grading! At least look at the original....
