This film is garbage.Over long, muddled, confused, boring, with no likable characters.The story-as far as I can decipher-relates to a woeful future time whenreplicants/robots seek to destroy earlier models.But of course the film tries to dictate to us that there being nosubstitute for humans... the problem with that preaching is that itwas, I assume, a human who made this total nonsense of a movie!What is just as bad as the blandness of this picture is that many socalled professional film reviewers are writing treatises etc., on howwonderful is this film.The fact- as opposed to the science fiction- is that this flick is adisaster and an abject mess:1/10
