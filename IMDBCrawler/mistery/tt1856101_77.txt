The only reason I gave this a 2, instead of a 1 is for the superb soundmixing. This is an excellent example of a lack of good editing. It wasat least an hour too long. How this movie got anything over a 4 is mindboggling! People must be judging it on the special effects alone. Idisliked this for so many reasons. The story has too many flaws (Bees?There is no vegetation?), the pacing is excruciatingly slow, all thecharacters are one dimensional, there is almost no meaningful dialogue,the violence is unnecessarily graphic, all the women are depicted aseither psychopathic killers or prostitutes (with only one exception,the pitiful "dreamer"). Did I even mention the pornigraphic statues? Mybest guess is this was an homage to a "Clockwork Orange".I could have had a more enjoyable experience watching an episode ofCSI. It was like they couldn't decide whether to be a sequel or ahorror movie. Sequel won, but horror movie would have worked better.There were so many scenes that could have benefited from a jump scare.It was filmed as such, with the creepy music (again the best part), thecharacter standing alone with vast empty spaces behind them, unknownpeople chasing them. But they just left the character standing there.It was like a bunch of jokes with no punchlines.The holographic girlfriend was annoying and pointless. The "sex" scenewas annoying and incomplete. It was like watching my IPad buffer. Andwho didn't see her demise coming a mile away. Yawn.Ryan Gossling gets more unattractive to me with each additional badmovie. If I was Harrison Ford I would have punched him for real too.
