I am one of the biggest Blade Runner fans on the planet. My licenseplate reflects that. I had no intention of watching another "BladeRunner" movie, since, well, it was done. But when I found out HarrisonFord was attached to the project, I knew it had to be somethingspecial. He had vowed he would never reprise that role. I wish hehadn't. This movie is a lot like the book "Do Androids Dream ofElectric Sheep". Things randomly happen for no apparent reason. It iscompletely disjointed. It played like a script by committee. I wasgoing to wait to buy a DVD box set until this was added. I won'tanymore. This will never be be a classic. 3 hours of my life I willnever get back. It was pointless.
