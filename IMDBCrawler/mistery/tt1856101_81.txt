Truly I thought I was watching the "Heaven's Gate" of sci-fi. Everybeautiful shot goes on and on and on until you scream "move along,already!" The reward for this butt-numbing length is a plot minimal tothe point of nonexistence, and a resolution so trivial it could barelyanchor a soap opera. If I hadn't known better I would judge from hisperformance that Ryan Gosling couldn't act his way through a Cheerioscommercial. He wears a completely blank expression bleaching anyemotional impact out of a scene, even as his virtual girlfriend finds away to make love to him for the first time. Wait for it on video, asit's only endurable on 4X fast forward. In installments.
