OK, maybe it's my fault. I'm sure some sci-fi nerds will blame me, butI can't find a reason to like this movie. I left the theater feelinglike I missed something, like there is some huge plot point that passedme by and my lack of intelligence is getting in the way of enjoying themovie. The cinematography, easily the best part of the movie, isself-indulgent as if the director told the editors, "We paid a lot ofmoney for these visually spectacular sets; put them on-screen untilthey are a complete distraction from the story line." The music is so grating it rivals the sets in its level ofobnoxiousness. At more than one point, I felt myself falling asleep,only to be jolted awake by the sounds of high school brass sectioncompeting to see who can play the lowest note.Add to those, the unexplained plot points and the movie is a recipe forwalking out. Although I didn't leave, I haven't felt so compelled to doso since Leprechaun in 1993. If the rest of my party would have hintedthey were done, I would have been out the door.In the end, I don't think the fault is mine. I think it's in themovie's producers who are trying to capitalize on the names, includingRyan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Blade Runner, while making a moviethat plays well to foreign box offices.
