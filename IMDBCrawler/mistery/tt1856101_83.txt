The acting was amazing as always with these professionals, Harrison,Gosling and the crew. They were right on point! Loved it.But the story was long, drawn out and extremely boring at most times. Iactually almost fell asleep a few times in the I-MAX theater.This did not live up to the hype. Although I did like the design of theSpinner Car. Other then that, I wanted my money back. Sad, I was solooking forward too seeing this film. Was saddened by the overall story line. In my "Opinion" do not wasteyour money on this title. It was lacking in plot and delivered nothingexciting at all except seeing the old characters back together oncemore.
