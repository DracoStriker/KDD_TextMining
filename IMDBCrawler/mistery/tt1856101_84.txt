I had high expectations for this sequel. The music was ofteninappropriate and annoying. It did not seem like 2049 at all. Manyparts of the movie seems to unnecessarily drag on. I struggled to sitthrough to the very end. One of the most disappointing parts of themovie was that they were still smoking!
