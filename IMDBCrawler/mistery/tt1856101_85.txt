I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I didn't expectawful. I'm old enough to remember the original movie which wasinnovative and interesting. Most of the acting in the original wasstellar and it wasn't gimmicky. I can't say the same for this sequel(which might just be a set up for a third unfortunately). Ryan Goslingscharacter was interesting, most of the other replicants were not. JaredLeto's character was just annoying. Robin Wright's small butinteresting part was maybe the highlight of the whole film. You noticeI haven't said much about Harrison Ford who is Indiana Jones old manmode.The most annoying part of the was the visuals and the music (at least Ithis that's what they're calling it). I though of 2001 Space Odessy butthat music was actually good. It was suppose to post-war California butthe sets were so dark you couldn't see the characters. In one scene Ikept thinking of Mad Max and not Blade Runner. Totally a missedopportunity to make an interesting sequel.
