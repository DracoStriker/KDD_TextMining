The first movie (which should have stayed the only movie) is amasterpiece of sci fi. I was hooked from the start great story and forthe time great FX also cannot beat the soundtrack by Vangelis.Not sure what is going on with Ridley Scott first with is AlienConvenant he destroyed the series there and now with the new additionof blade runner.I feel that all the positive reviews for this movie are fake, becausethe movie is a sad excuse to make money and makes no sense at all, nosurprised it failed this weekend at the box office.The acting is good so are the special effects, but the story is weakand none existent, Tyrell corporation is gone and there is a newcompany that makes the replicans, and tyrell had found a way for themto reproduce and have babies.This is where the story gets weird, Deckard is brought back into themix because he had a child with Rachel.The movie also lack action and in the end does not explain anything. Ifelt like a huge waste of 2h and a half.35y in the making for this wow just wow.
