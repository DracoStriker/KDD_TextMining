Sci-fi seems to have been appropriated and now means 'about nothing solong as the date is sometime in the future'. The original Blade Runnerwas a detective story not dissimilar to something Humphrey Bogart mighthave been in. The original Alien was a slasher horror film notdissimilar to Halloween or Friday 13th. The latest Ridley Scottfacsimiles (Prometheus & BR 2049) have no underlying style and aretherefore boring, slipping in some quasi-Christian rubbish to anotherwise inferior copy of the original films.To sum up, these films are cheating us by copying & pasting a fewminutes from a successful film into a boring, going nowhere film andexpecting it to fly.
