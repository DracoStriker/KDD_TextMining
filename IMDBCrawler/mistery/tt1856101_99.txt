In the original movie Blade Runners were around to retire dangerousandroids, called replicants, which were running amok. In the new movie,replicants are, for all practical purposes, GMOs, so there's no needfor Blade Runners to even exist. Replicants are basically humans withserial numbers.They can put as many boobs in the movie as they want and it won't fillthe terrific hole through the foundation.
