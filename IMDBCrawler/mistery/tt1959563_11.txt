This has got to be one of the worst action movies that I have everseen. The lead actors are totally wasted on this rubbish, Samuel LJackson must be desperate for a paycheck to even think of loweringhimself in parts like these. I don't know why the makers of moviesthese days even bother hiring a scriptwriter, as the entire movie isjust one long F**K, or endless variations of the word, they evenmanaged to cram three 'M***********S' into one sentence! It is strictlya by the numbers movie, the head of the agency is a masculine lookingwoman, the agent assigned to protect Jackson is a woman,the villain hasseemingly thousands of henchmen all willing to die at his bidding,there is the van chase through the streets, the motorbike chase throughthe market,the motorboat chase through the canals....Yawn! If you are12 years old and like to hear the 'F' word over and over again, orotherwise totally brain dead, then you will love this mess of a movie.
