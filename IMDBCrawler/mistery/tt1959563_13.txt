The positives: It does have a handful of jokes that land well.The negatives: Most of the jokes fall flat.None of the actors have any chemistry with each other and theperformances range from bad to decent. Salma Hayek's character inparticular is unbelievably annoying. she plays a stereo-typically loudMexican woman who screams a lot (in Spanish of course, because that'sapparently supposed to be funny).The story is beyond forgettable. Stereotypical bad guys are trying tokill the good guys. They also try to make the viewer care about theromantic relationships, but it's too forced and it just ends up being awaste of screen time.The people working on this film didn't know how to work with lighting.The shots with windows in the background were particularly annoying tolook at, because of how poorly they handled the lighting.TL;DR 5/10 don't watch it.
