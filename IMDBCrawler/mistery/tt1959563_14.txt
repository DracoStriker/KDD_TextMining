This movie has absolutely nothing new or special to offer. The"acting", action, humor, you've seen it all before. What makes itwatchable is the chemistry between Jackson and Reynolds, the obviousfun they're having, and the speed of this movie which never gets slow.You don't have to do it for the story, because every bit of story or"so called character development" is just a tool to pass the time tothe next action scene. You don't have to do it for the acting.Everything is so over the top, and the horrible dutch accents don'thelp either. Only Gary Oldman shows some skill here, but he's lost inthe mess.You do it for the fun. We went to the cinema and had to choose betweencoffee or beer. Luckily, we chose beer. Jackson and Reynolds aren't thebest actors, with Reynolds being a one-trick pony. But the fun they'rehaving on screen is contagious, so you might just have a good time.Take the beer, though.
