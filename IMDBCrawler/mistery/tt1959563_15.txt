This is so derivative of other, sooo much better films, that I turnedit off half way in. The action scenes are OK but the foul language isso forced and unbelievable that it was like a teenager shouting "I canswear, ain't it cool?" It's not half as cute or witty or fun as it thinks it is so it wore outits welcome long before the end.
