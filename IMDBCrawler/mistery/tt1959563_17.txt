The Hit-man's BodyguardYou should never hand your hit-man friend a guest list and ask them totake care of it.Thankfully, the contract killer in this action-comedy isn't attendingany parties any time soon.Willing to testify against a murderous dictator (Gary Oldman) inexchange for his wife's (Salma Hayek) release from prison, renownedbutton man Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) is paired with disgracedbodyguard Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) to ensure that he makes it to thewitness stand alive.Unfortunately, Bryce's uptight approach towards witness protectionconflicts with Kincaid's laidback attitude towards killing. However,Interpol's plan to betray both brings them together. While the action and the plot of this over-the-top buddy picture arepretty much old hat, the rapid-fire banter between the two archetypal,yet charismatic, leads do make up for the film's numerous shortcomings.Incidentally, as an assassin's bodyguard you get to pat down a lot ofhigh paid therapists.
