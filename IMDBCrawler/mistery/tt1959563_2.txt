I just saw a preview of "Hitman's Bodyguard" last night with my wife.We are both fan's of action and comedy and went into this hoping itwould be as good as we hoped from the actor's involved. I am a HUGE SamJackson fan and an equally big Ryan Reynolds fan. I'm glad to say thatthis movie did not disappoint! I would've given this movie a 10 if only voting on the action andcomedy but there were a couple of plot points that were slightlypredictable. I don't feel these couple of things hurt the movie muchdue to what the movie is being advertised as, which is an action comedyand this is by far where it shines. I laughed harder during some scenesof this movie than I've laughed in a long time during a movie. The lastI remember laughing harder is last year during "Deadpool". If you like lots of action and great comedy with actors with plenty ofchemistry and don't mind a significant amount of f-bombs, which ifyou're a Sam Jackson fan I'm guessing you don't, then drop some cashfor a ticket. You won't be disappointed!!
