Sam J and Ryan Reynolds cannot act, yet they were the leads together inthis movie.I love buddy cop type movies and this was a turd. The lines were poorlydelivered by both actors with their usual monotone voices that make youthink, they both made love to Harvey Weinstein's wife or something.I have no idea how Ryan Reynolds was great in Deadpool, yet bad ineverything else he has done, and Sam Jackson is simply a bad actor whohas made a career out of being bald and Black.Movie, hit-man who now needs to protect a former rival and throw asplash in of poorly written and delivered comedy, a few moments of themtalking about their hot headed women who are also bad actors, andblamooo, we get this turd.I am a very easy going movie watcher and this was just something I hada hard time watching. It was a bland mess, poorly written lines, andbad acting.Do NOT recommend.
