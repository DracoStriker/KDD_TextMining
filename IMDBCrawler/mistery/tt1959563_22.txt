If you love Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, then you're going tolove this movie. I had so much fun watching it and laughed with all myheart. I loved the cast and the action scenes (they were a lot of fakeaction scenes but that was expected) and the jocks were one of the bestI've heard in a while in a movie.It's a great movie to watch with your friends and laugh. I could easilywatch it again.
