The Hit-man's Bodyguard can be compared to most action comedies with adiverse cast and cliché ridden plots. The hero is bland as always,there's a boring romance element to it as always, and it can bedownright cringe worthy at times as always. This isn't a terrible filmin anyway, but it doesn't deserve the current rating of 7 either. Themost important fact about the film is that two actors, Ryan Reynoldsand Samuel L. Jackson, try their very best to carry the film till thevery end. The rest of the cast was awful, truly awful, felt like as ifyou were watching a B-grade movie. It was severely disappointing to seeGary Oldman and Salma Hayek perform so poorly in this movie. To be honest, I had fun watching this movie. The movie was at its bestwhen it was moving quickly, the action seemed great (though it reallywasn't with all the quick cuts) and some funny moments here and there.The only time the movie really suffered was when it slowed down, andbelieve me, it slowed down a lot. The movie often tried to divertitself from the plot and dwelve into sub plots which were poorlyexecuted and belonged nowhere in the movie. The love interests of thetwo main characters were also poor characters portrayed poorly as well. It's a good movie to watch if you're bored, if you don't have anythingelse to watch, or just want to pass the time. Don't go in with highexpectations, and at least you won't be disappointed.
