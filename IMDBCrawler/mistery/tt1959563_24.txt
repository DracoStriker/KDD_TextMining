It was one of the better movies I've seen in the past few years, I'llgive it that. I would've given it 10 stars, if it hadn't been for thefact that it was dragged out by mindless, killing scenes or justcontinuous gun shooting. The other problem I have with it is that ithas an overdone "moral" at the end, and some of the jokes were tooforced, and all that political theme is also overdone. They could'veworked out some of the background and reasoning for the characters'behavior better to be more creative.If you're reading reviews on here because you're going to the moviestonight, I would suggest, if you want a comedy, to go see Logan Luckyinstead(it's funnier), or if you don't care if it's funny or not, WindRiver is also a lot better than this movie.
