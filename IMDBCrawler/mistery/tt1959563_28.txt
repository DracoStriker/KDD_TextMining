I loved this film, it is sleek fast paced and laugh out loud funny. Allthe characters are great - from Ryan Reynolds playing it straight,Samuel L Jackson being a bad ass and Salma Hayek in her most funniestrole as Samuel L Jackson's love interest what is there not to like. Theacting and filming is top notch, for me this has to be one of thecoolest films of 2017. I can't wait for this to come out on DVD so Ican watch it again and again - money well spent at the cinema and waituntil full credits to roll, there is a nice little blooper at the end.
