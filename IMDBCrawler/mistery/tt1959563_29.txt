Da#n! And I thought this was going to be a lame B movie. Thankful thebad marketing and stupid title didn't offset the good word of mouthabout this gem. The film is about a professional hit-man who has todeliver his arch nemesis safely to a courtroom to testify against areally bad dude. This film has good action, many laughs but the realreason this film kills it is because of the dynamic between Reynoldsand Jackson. They play off each other so well. Good movies are notwithout their faults. The lady playing Reynold's love interest can'tact. She is the same chick who brought down the stock of Netflix'sDaredevil. I'm usually ahead of the game on these things; people don'tsee it now but they will once someone makes the mistake of casting heragain in anything. Second, the main bad guy's enforcer was a lamechallenge. Weak villains make a difference and can make a filmunnecessarily bloated when it isn't. That is how I felt every time Isaw the dude. Other then those things, awesome movie!
