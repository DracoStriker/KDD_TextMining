I give this film a 7 because it was pretty light on story and almost inthe B category, but Jackson and Reynolds are super funny together andSalma Hayek's character was ridiculously hilarious. She really made melaugh because I've never seen her do this type of character. There's nobig meaning in this film. Great mindless summer film.
