In these politically correct PG13 superheo movie CGI crap infestedtimes, "The Hitmans Bodyguard", is a breath of fresh air. This is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. It simply delivers on all levels. It's really, really funny and theamazing chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, (who is68 years old and still makes actionmovies and look good doing it whichis very impressive) makes it a feel good action comedy. *SPOILERS AHEAD*The plot is simple: Reynolds is a former 3 star bodyguard who, verymuch against his will, has to escort Jackson to a trial where a Russiandictator is charged with genocide, played very well by an almostunrecognizable Gary Oldman. If Reynolds can pull this off, he can gethis 3 stars back and possibly win back his ex-girlfriend who he blamesfor losing his stars. With memorable lines like this one from Reynolds: "this guysinglehandedly ruined the word motherf***** and that is not an easything to do". This is happening why hit men chase Jackson around in thebackground and Reynolds just had enough. One of many many funny scenes. But the action itself is also great. Lots of carchases, explosions,hand to hand combat a nasty torture scene and lots of blood And a lotof f-bombs. And every time a scene gets a little emotional some unexpected actionhappens. Mostly it's hilarious. And an extra bonus the still very hot Salma Hayek, who is also funnyplays Jacksons wife. She calls Jackson her little cuca racha whichmeans cock roach. At an hour and 58 minutes it's also a perfect length, where you don'tget bored, like you do with most movies today that drag on somewherebettwen two and a half and three hours. If you, like me have had it with cencored boring PG13 action and grownmen in spandex suits and you miss those great actionmovies from the90'ies like The Last Boyscout and Point Break, then this movie is foryou.
