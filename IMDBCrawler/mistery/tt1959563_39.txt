The Hit-man's Bodyguard is racy and entertaining, if generic, actionthriller. It is generic in plot- putting two charismatic actorstogether with their chemistry and comedic timing driving the movieforward. It is racy in treatment- hurtling from one action sequence tothe other.Micheal Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) is a AAA rated bodyguard, who falls fromgrace when his client gets terminated by assassin for hire, man-on-a-mission-to-rid-the-world-of-evil-people and passionate lover DariusKincaid (Samuel L Jackson). The washed-up Michael gets a chance toredeem himself by transporting Darius safely to testify against asadistic dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). What follows is arace against time, as Dukhovich unleashes hell on the two wisecrackingheroes."This guy single-handedly ruined the word mother**ker" The Hit-man's Bodyguard excels solely because director Patrick Hugheslets the leads do what they do best- Samuel L Jackson gets to sayMother***cker every few minutes, while Ryan Reynolds gets the familyfriendly witty one-liners. It is mostly a laughathon then; even theposter is a rip-off from Kevin Costner- Whitney Houston starrer- TheBodyguard. Throw corrupt cops, lovelorn psychotic lovers, boat chases,bike chases, car chases in the mix, along with beautifulcinematography, and a rocking background score, nevertheless at the endit is just a cheesy, buddy flick.But then, I cannot stress on this enough, it is Jackson and Reynoldsthat makes it so watchable. Jackson looks like he continued from whereSnakes on a Plane ended, while for Reynolds, think Deadpool with a PGfilter.7/10 for The Hit-man's Bodyguard- it is a solid, predictable actioncomedy.
