I've seen B-production movies that were more entertaining, or at leastmore realistic, than this. Things that happen in this movie would beinteresting to children under 10 years old and retarded people. Humoris horrible, dialogs are made of recycled excerpts from other movies.If you wanna good action comedy watch Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) whichis an amazing movie, or any sequel of Lethal Weapon. Those movies showhow an action comedy should look like. For a start, one needs a properscript-writer, not an amateur. Without a good script even good actorscan't excel.In this movie Ryan Reynolds is very boring and Samuel L. Jackson isirritating and pitiful. The only thing you look forward in this movieis to press the stop button and go watch something interesting.
