I was really looking forward to seeing this film - it has aninteresting premise and two great actors who I really like.Unfortunately the experience was pretty disappointing. Its like thestudio just put together a bunch of action movie clichés and justpumped out another one using the same old tired stereotypes. Even thecar chases and fight scenes were the same thing we have seen hundredsof times before. I really was thinking of switching this off for mostof the film - it was that bad. I can say, things improved slightly atthe end - and patient viewers will be rewarded with a reasonableclimax. The lead-up to it though, was just not interesting. Even thetwo very talented stars couldn't make it work, and thats sayingsomething.
