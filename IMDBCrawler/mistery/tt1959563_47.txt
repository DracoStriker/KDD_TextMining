This is the first review i've written on here, but felt i had to forthis film. Watched last night and can honestly say my favourite film ofthe year, and the first film, other than a musical, i cant wait to goand see again. From the opening scenes you love the characters with alltheir faults. Ryan and Sam just must make more movies as Hit-man andBodyguard, the chemistry is undeniable. Salma Hayek was a great castingfor Sams wife and her scenes add even more to the OTT nature of thefilm. The soundtrack was great. This may all seem a bit over the topfor a review, but that's how good it was. Do not miss.....
