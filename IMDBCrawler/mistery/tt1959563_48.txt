This was one of the most funny movies I have seen in a long time.There's a decent amount of violence and bad language, but the specialtaste of humor made me laugh like I hadn't in a year or more. SamuelJackson is hilarious in his role! Chases through Amsterdam are cool. Itdid not seem realistic that the bad guys in cars can keep up with Samin a speedboat though the canals.
