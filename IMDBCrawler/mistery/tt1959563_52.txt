While watching this movie, there were moments when I wanted to givethis film a nine or even a ten. It has some truly funny moments, andthe best use of Lionel Richie's 'Hello' that I've seen - the momentwhen Samuel L Jackson's character falls in love is one of the funniestthings I've seen in a movie. Ryan Reynolds' long-suffering,working-stiff character is the perfect foil for Jackson's panache andthey set each other off perfectly. Only very occasionally does thehumor hit a flat note.Gary Oldman is versatile and convincing in any character as always, andSalma Hayek is, once again, agelessly beautiful - and, surprisingly,very funny as a fiery latina.That said, I had to deduct two points for the annoying motorcyclechase, which will teach every attention-craving, unloved (and almostcertainly unlovable) idiot who sees this film that the way to be coolis to BRRRAAAAATTTTTTT through a peaceful city. That, and RyanReynolds' relationship sub-plot was unnecessary and took away from whatcould have been a perfect movie. To show an otherwise competent, grownman with that kind of hangup is hard to believe at best, andcringe-worthy at worst.Another thing that could have been done better was that the villainswere very generic and left more or less undeveloped. The chief henchmandoesn't quite have the same presence as Gotz Otto in 'Tomorrow NeverDies' or Everett McGill in 'Under Siege 2: Dark Territory.' At onepoint he takes an axe to the thorax and keeps fighting. To makesomething like that even remotely believable, you need someone with thephysical presence of, say, Ralf Moeller.Bonus points for Caravaggio's "Judith Beheading Holofernes" making anappearance early on in the film. It (and a very cute dachshund) adds anice touch of character development to someone who's only in the moviefor a few minutes, and shows that someone paid a lot of attention todetail.Overall, a very funny movie and definitely worth watching quite a fewtimes.
