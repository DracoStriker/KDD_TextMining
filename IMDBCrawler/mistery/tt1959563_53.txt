The movie is a good blend of comedy and action. After quite sometime,Samuel L. Jackson managed to provide a nice movie to watch. Both RyanReynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are great in the movie. The actionscenes were very nicely done and the movie is also hilarious at timesalthough I'm not much of a comedy guy but still liked it. Highlyrecommended for fans of Comedy/Action genre. Overall goodentertainment.
