I didn't expect much from this one to be honest, as we have seenthousands of movies like this before.I also lately felt that Ryan Reynolds and his humor in the movies havegotten somewhat overexposed and SL Jackson overexposed period, butthese guys somehow pulls this of. its not a superb movie but it isn'tbad either.if you feel you are a hobby movie critic then yes this movie is not foryou, simple story, plot holes, clichés so on and so forth. Theridiculous swearing and bad language ( loses 1 point for that ) isannoying, but other then that its quite fun. SLJ and RR do actuallywork good together.totally OK movie in my books
