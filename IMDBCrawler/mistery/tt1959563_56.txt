Seems to me action flicks from the US follow a simple formula thesedays.Take a buddy/buddy action duo, add in some swearing, crude jokes, lotsof shooting/violence, a bare bones story line (maybe something negativeabout Russia or the USSR?)a few hot chicks and bake for 100 or sominutes and there you have it. If you are happy with this recipe then you may like The Hit-man'sBodyguard. In fairness its watchable on a very superficial level but Ihave to confess I became bored quite quickly. There was nothing reallygenuinely witty or clever about the narrative or characterisations butthen to be fair, yet again, I had not expected much going in. An OK watch if you are having a slow wet weekend. Five out of ten fromme.
