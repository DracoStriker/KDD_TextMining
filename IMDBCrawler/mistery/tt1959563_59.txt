In this Patrick Hughes (The Expendables 3, Red Hill) directed and TomO'Connor (Fire with Fire) written film, Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool, TheProposal) and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Kingsman: The SecretService) star as the world's top bodyguard, Michael Bryce, and his hitman client, Darius Kincaid, respectively. Asked by his ex-girlfriendAmelia Roussel (Elodie Young: TVs Daredevil, The Girl with the DragonTattoo) to get Kincaid delivered to court in order to testify againstBelarusian dictator Vladislav Dukhovic (Gary Oldman: The Dark Knight,Batman Begins), they must collaborate to stay alive.A little slow to start, but when it did, this movie was aroller-coaster ride of laughs and action. With excellent acting anddeadpan humour, this more than made up for the fact that you knew whatwas going to happen all the way through. An excellent turn from SalmaHayek (Desperado, Frida) as Kincaid's wife Sonia, which was reminiscentof Pulp Fiction, great chemistry between the two leads which takes usinto 'buddy-cop' territory, Deadpool-esque comedy and Bourne-likeaction, this was a winner for me. Oldman, as always, is powerful as thetyrannical dictator, if written a little clichéd, but for me it was thedialogue that truly delivered.Don't miss the end credits scene of Ryan Reynolds having to wait forsome bells to stop ringing to complete his scene.
