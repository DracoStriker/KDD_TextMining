The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a great movie with a very well written plotand a top notch cast. It is great fun from start to finish, anenjoyable buddy comedy with a bit of a twist. The film is as hilariousas it is action packed, containing both moments that had me in stitchesas well as parts that kept me at the edge of my seat, a very impressivemix of both genres that really kept me entertained. The soundtrack isalso excellent, featuring countless classics, one of those movies thatyou will find yourself singing along to and looking up the musicafterwards. It was certainly inconsistent on some aspects and was not as great asit could have been, there was definitely potential there for this to bea nine. For one thing, the love plot line fails to take me away, asmuch as I liked Jackson and Hayak's characters, we never see them inthe same scene together and thus do not really care for them toreunite. Gary Oldman's character was also flat as the main antagonist,I had no gripes with this flawless actors performance, but his dialoguewas so flat that he was never a real threat to the main characters. The cast itself is stellar, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson have abeautiful chemistry together and you can tell they got along very wellon set. Salma Hayak also has some terrific, clearly improvised scenesthat really stand out, and Oldman is stellar as always, showing hisversatility. Great, simple fun. While it's nothing flawless, The Hit-man's Bodyguardcan be forgiven for how entertaining it truly is, I would recommend itto anyone looking for a good action or comedy. A high class bodyguard is teamed up with a ruthless hit-man in order toget him to a trial on time. Best Performance: Samuel L. Jackson
