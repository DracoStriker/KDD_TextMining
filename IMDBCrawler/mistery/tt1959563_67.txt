If you like your action consisting of average car chases with the 'badguys' leaning out of the windows firing 2000 bullets per minute andhitting nothing, this is the film for you.Inconsistent in style, mostly sub TV material quality with occasionalbursts of something that's half decent. Seems like just about everyscene shot ended up in the film to boost it's massively over longrunning time.I'm also at a loss as to why people find the interplay between the twomains amusing. Poorly written and that's being generous.It seems most reviews are written by people with little experience ofcinema other than explosions and in this case poor ones at that.
