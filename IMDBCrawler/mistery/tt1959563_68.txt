I lost count of the number of chases and they were good. With greatacting and lots of laughs but with a slightly serious note to it aswell this made for an excellent movie. Selma Hayek was brilliant as thefoul mouthed, violent wife of the Hit-man. The hit-man and thebodyguard were both good as well being seasoned actors. The story movedalong at a quick pace with action filling most scenes.. You won't fallasleep in this movie. It was predictable in parts but other scenescontained some surprises and it was always fun. It is an action comedy, a light hearted movie experience, so if youwalk into the theatre expecting that you won't be disappointed.
