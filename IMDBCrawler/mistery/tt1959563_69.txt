The Hit-man's Bodyguard was a really funny movie... so much funnierthan I had expected it to be. The action is great and performed well byboth Jackson and Reynolds. The movie has an intelligible story thatflows well and never left me bored or praying for the end. I reallyenjoyed it and hope to see more from this new buddy comedy duo. Ihighly recommend seeing this flick!
