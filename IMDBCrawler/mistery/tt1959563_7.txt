Well what a waste of my time. I don't know if the movie is bad or not,but i have seen this type of movies a 100 times. Very cliché, veryembarrassing to look at times. Ryan Reynolds performing as a unsuitedDeadpool, cause that's what his character is, Deadpool without a suit.We get it, he is suppose to be funny and sarcastic, but come on, not inevery single line of the movie. There is a scene "spoilers" Where he isbeing torture, that it has the same feeling as when Wayde Wilson wasbeing held in the mutant x underground laboratory.On the other side, Samuel L Jackson, must have signed a contract to saymotherfuker. every time he can or the producing company made that,because, well he says it at least 20 times. Really hard to finishmovie. Is a movie that you wont even remember that existed a couple ofmoths from now. Watched in the cinemas. PLEASE Don't, wait for DVDrelease or stream it.
