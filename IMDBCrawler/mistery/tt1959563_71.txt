REVIEW - THE HITMANS BODYGUARD I did wonder how this would work or if it would work at all. 2 action stars sharing the screen, would one have a better part thanthe other but......A full on action film with humour, basically a version of Lethal Weaponbut with the roles reversed. Actually if you enjoyed the Lethal Weapon films (no comment about theTV version) then you will enjoy this.Make time for this film. Rating 10 out of 10
