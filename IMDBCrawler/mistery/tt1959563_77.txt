Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) is a methodical private contractor bodyguard who has fallen from grace. Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) is aBelarus butcher on trial in the Hague. The witnesses against him haveall died. There is only one man who can testify against him and that isDarius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) a skilled hit-man. He agrees inexchange for his wife's (Salma Hayek) freedom. Kincaid is escorted byAmelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) a former girlfriend of Bryce. (Everythingties together in this film.) She runs into trouble and seeks the helpof Bryce to help her out. Bryce and Kincaid have a hate-haterelationship that as one might expect blossoms into a bromance withconversation being expectantly foreboding.The film is a comedy-action film that has over-the-top action whichwould be a spoof of modern action films if they were not so impossibleto begin with. Samuel L. Jackson is his gritty colorful self who Ithought was going to quote Ezekiel 25:17, for a moment, but does not.Reynolds contrasts Jackson as a "boring is always best" tough guy whodoes things on cue.The sound track of mostly 80's music added to the film. I howled whilethey played Lionel Ritchie.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Jackson "sings." 4 1/2 stars
