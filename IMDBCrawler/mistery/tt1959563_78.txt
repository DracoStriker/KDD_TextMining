I found this movie very entertaining. The Hit-man's Bodyguard, is anaction comedy that does not take itself very seriously; but brings thelaughs and satisfaction all the way. When you go watch a movie, withthe expectation to be entertained, and have a good time; you will.Turning off my usually critical mind, and simply allowing myself enjoythe action comedy and rolling with it, was a very nice experience. Thismovie's got a mix of everything: wow-factor, bad-assness, laughs, depthto the hit-man's backstory, his impressively capable and sexy wife,lots of bullets, intrigue, dry humor, big budget, crazy-credits, andthe list goes on. Ignore any negative reviews, and go see with theintent and expectation to forget all the crap in the world for twohours, thoroughly enjoy it, have fun, and be entertained.
