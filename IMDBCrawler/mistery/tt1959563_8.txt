I gave this movie such a high mark because it made me laugh like Ihaven't laughed in a while at a movie. It does not have an intricateplot-line, it is predictable but has great lines.I will say this. With any other actors than Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L.Jackson this would have been a flop. You can see the humor thatReynolds has in Deadpool and that Jackson has in Django Unchained here.I think this is what I liked the most.They also have great chemistrytogether, I personally would not have guessed this, but now it makes alot of sense.It has interesting action scenes. I personally am not really into thatso it makes no difference to me, but they seem pretty good.They alsodon't go overboard to make it not credible, but exaggerated enough thatit is funny.It is easy, it does not make you think a lot afterwards but itentertains you and I think this was the role of this film. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.
