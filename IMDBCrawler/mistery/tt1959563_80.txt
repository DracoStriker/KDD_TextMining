'THE Hit-man'S BODYGUARD': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new action-comedy starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, asa hit-man (Jackson), who's supposed to testify at the InternationalCourt of Justice, and his bodyguard (Reynolds). The film costars ElodieYung, Salma Hayek, Gary Oldman, Joaquim de Almeida and Richard E.Grant. It was directed by Patrick Hughes (who also helmed 'THEEXPENDABLES 3') and it was written by Tom O'Connor (the script wasfeatured on the 2011 Black List). It's received mixed (to negative)reviews from critics, but it is a hit at the Box Office so far. I foundit to be a pretty amusing action buddy flick.A sadistic Eastern European dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Oldman), ison trial for atrocious crimes against his people, but there's notenough legal evidence to convict him. Notorious hit-man Darius Kincaid(Jackson) makes a deal to testify against Dukhovich, in order to freehis incarcerated wife (Hayek). Expert bodyguard Michael Bryce(Reynolds), who's fallen on hard times recently, is tasked withtransporting Kincaid from the United Kingdom to the International Courtof Justice. The only problem is that the two are mortal enemies, andthey also have an army of bloodthirsty assassins (working forDukhovich) trying to kill them the whole time. They of course bond ontheir adventurous road trip.The movie is actually a surprisingly cool action flick; which shouldn'tbe that surprising (I guess), considering it was directed by the guywho did 'THE EXPENDABLES 3' (and I'm a fan of that film as well). Themovie also has great chemistry between it's two leading men, and it'squite funny at times as well; Hayek and Yung are also both great intheir roles too (and sexy). The movie does get a little long at times,but for the most part it's a lot of fun. Especially if you like goodactions flicks, and Reynolds and Jackson!Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://youtu.be/KR0HDeT91m0
