What is wrong with movies these days they seem to ge duller and dullerand this film is no exception the action is sub par the humoru ischeesy at best the sound tract reminds me of an NHL 11 with its music(i should know i own it) the acting is blah if i could give it a halfstar i would i say if u see this flick make sure you use something tokeep ur self busy and just let it be used as back ground i got boredhalf way into it and i love action flicks its sad being i like bothrenolds and jackson as actors but they just didn't work in this film...if anything watch rush hour trilogy its way more better then thissteaming pile of crap
