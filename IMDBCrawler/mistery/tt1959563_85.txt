I've never heard of this movie, never thought I want to see it, eventhe title - "Hitmans Bodyguard"? - sounded like a B-movie from the90s...But I'd say this movie is the biggest surprise of the year so far. It'sjust great.They don't make 'em these days. If you're old enough to remember MelGibson and Danny Glover in the original Lethal Weapon - that's exactlythe kind.Surprisingly great action scenes, the chemistry between the twocharacters, Ryan's signature "Deadpool-ish" humor, and Samuel L.Jackson singing (whaaat), laughable jokes and self-irony everywhere,this is just a non-stop roller-coaster.The story is kinda obvious, but... the filmmakers know it, they evenmake fun of themselves. Like, yeah, here's an iPhone showing anincoming call from 'INTERPOL' - so what, bite me.Overall - a must see.PS. Too bad Netflix doesn't have it in countries where the movie isscheduled for theaters, can;t wait to see it AGAIN.
