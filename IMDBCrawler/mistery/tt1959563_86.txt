Pure and sweet describes this flick starring Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L.Jackson, Gary Oldman and Salma Hayek. Critics are wrong about thismovie being clichéd, it has a lot more to offer than that. There's fun,hilarious, action packed moments through out. I knew since firstwatching the trailers for this movie that it would be great and themovie ended up exceeding my expectations, this is a must see for allaction movie lovers, with chemistry (between Reynolds and Jackson) thatsome producers and directors could simply only dream about this moviejust comes to life, don't miss seeing this movie 9/10 a very happy reviewer :)
