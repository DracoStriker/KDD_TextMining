I enjoyed the movie to a point and it was a good combination of RyanReynolds and Samuel L Jackson. The bad thing is, I don't enjoy knowingwhat is going to happen and how things are going to work out before Iam even half way through the movie. Everything that was done in thismovie has been done in hundreds or even thousands of other movies. It'sa middle of the road action movie with a few good laughs as you wouldexpect from Ryan and Samuel, but it is no doubt nothing groundbreaking. Entertaining for the time it runs, but very forgettable andwill never become a classic.
