Cinema review. Spoiler possibly included.I was adrenalized by The Hit-man's Bodyguard, I thought it would justanother popcorn movie, my mood was short earlier. However, this actionmovie way much exceed my expectation!Every minute is intense and thrilling, my attention was totallycaptured throughout the entire movie. Samuel and the guy from Deadpoolhave a great chemistry, their fighting and argument amused everyaudience in the theater, it was so enjoyable to watch. This is thefunniest comedy and exciting action movie in 2017 so far.The story is about an 3A protection agency (Ryan Reynolds) failed hiscareer and become a bodyguard because his client got killed, and hebelieved his Interpol agent girlfriend sold him out. Yet the bodyguardstill loves the agent, so he agreed when the interpool agent asked himto protect a witness to the international court in 24(?) hours becauseshe needed a system outsider to help. There were spies inside theinterpool, and huge groups foreigner hit-men wanted to hunt down thewitness. The witness is the most notorious hit men (Samuel L Jackson)in the world, killed 250 targets in his career. The protection deliveryjourney is thrilling and funny, hit-man and protection agent is naturalenemy, and they usually fired on each other before; their personalitiesalso stand opposite, a planner elitism and a freehand unkillablehit-man. I laughed so hard with every argument they have.9/10 Take one point off to their horrible destroying, they destroyedeverywhere with all the fire, bombs and cars turnover, if this trulyhappened, poor Europe government going to have a huge debt.Lastly, RIP to these few days terrorist attacks in Europe. Every humanis a matter just like the movie scene. It is unforgivable to those whohold the power and use it against innocents. Peace.
