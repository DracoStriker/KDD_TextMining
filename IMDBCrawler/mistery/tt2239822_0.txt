Luc Besson's The Fifth Element has gained a cult following due to itsweird story and out there set designs. Now Besson is tackling anotherwacky space opera type movie with Valerian and the City of a ThousandPlanets which is a graphic novel that was an inspiration for Star Wars.Now we did have a similar scenario with John Carter as an inspirationfor multiple films receiving a modern film adaptation after many filmshave been released that have taken inspiration out of it. There is thedanger of it feeling cliché despite the age of the source material, butthe result results in a gorgeous looking movie with a weak script andcharacters.Good: The main draw are the visuals and they are wonderful. The worldthat is displayed looks lived in and fascinating with its technologyand alien beings. The CG is well rendered and explodes with an array ofcolors. The action scenes are fun with a good dose of creativity suchas an multi-dimensional chase scene in the beginning of the movie.Rihanna also receives what could possibly be the best scene in themovie that is both creative and fun.Bad: The script is the biggest detriment to this whole movie. Theattempts of humor are lame with unfunny jokes and banter that barelywarrants a laugh. The script also adds some cheesy lines that are moreeye rolling than cheeky fun. Dane DeHaan as Valerian is miscast becauseI just can't believe him as this super soldier. He also puts on a toughguy voice that is annoying. Cara Delevingne has a better character, butshe's also fairly wooden. This means there is no chemistry between themthus making the banter ineffective. Like I mentioned earlier, the storyshowing its age because other movies released since the graphic novelhas shown the same elements and pulled them off later.Overall, this movie could've been fun. It has the visuals and theaction, but the script and characters were way too weak to match thesurreal world. It is good for a rental, but I say stick to The FifthElement.
