Watching 'Valerian and the City of Thousand Planets' I was remindedwhat makes Science Fiction so enjoyable. It's not the space fights, thecool alien life forms, the futuristic metropolis. It's that all thesethings remind us how infinite this space is, how tiny our existence,and how precious.You probably have no idea what I am talking about. Just go watch thisfantastic movie and you will understand. To make it short: This moviewas perfect. It is a breathtaking, overwhelming vision of thecelebrated comics, brought to life with heartblood by Luc Besson.The less you know about the story the better. The film naming heroValerian is connected through his dreams to a distant planet. Itinvolves war between races, military intrigue, love & death, but morethen any other SciFi movie, this one is about the journey not thedestination. The countless side stories, and side characters are whatmakes this a breathing version of an unforgettable universe. This isthe best Sci Fiction film I've seen since 'The Matrix'.
