How could a director who was able to so cleverly match over-the-topChris Tucker with dead-pan, straight arrow Bruce Willis in "The FifthElement" end up with the two most banal characters ever, Dana DeHaanand Cara Delevingne? Throughout the film the only action you could lookforward to was one or both of them being blasted into small bits oreaten by one of the many monsters. When they would open their mouthsyou wondered if you were on some college campus.Their dialogue waschildish, insipid, and totally devoid of the kind of adult emotion thatdrew you into "Leon:The Professional" or "La Femme Nikita". Besson hasno excuse here; he directed and wrote this mess. I love Luc Besson'sprevious films. However, this was such a disappointment, you have towonder what the value will be for his upcoming remakes, Lucy 2 andColumbiana 2.
