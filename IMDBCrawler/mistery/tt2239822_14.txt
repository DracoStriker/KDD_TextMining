When I first saw the trailer for this, and being a huge fan of the(Vastly superior) Fifth Element, as well as Leon the Professional, Icould hardly wait to see it. What a mistake! I should have waited. Aterrible story cannot be supported by great visuals. This was oneboring, almost unfollowable story. The leads are pretty, but the inanedialogue waste's them totally. The entire SciFi part is wrapped arounda basically horny Valerian wanting to settle down with his fellowagent. The opening, about the building of station Alpha is the bestpart. The rest of the film goes downhill from there. Just a really hugemistake. After Luc's near miss with Lucy, (good until the end), I washoping that he would rebound with this, but this is just a huge, dull(I nearly fell asleep during it) mess of a movie. So sad, since therewas some serious potential here.
