This movie would have been pretty good if not for the horrible actingfrom Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne, and their high-school romance isham-fisted and stupid. They're probably the worst actors I've everseen, and they drag down this movie like an anchor. Apart from theleads this movie was visually stunning and could have been somethinggreat.
