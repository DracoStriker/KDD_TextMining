This movie must have been made by teenagers... A total lack of detail,with random scenes of fantastic colour and motion. Visually it isamazing, but most of the actors were terrible and the story lackedconsistency and detail. Also, inconsistent subtitles with thenon-English languages. Absolutely no chemistry between the 2 loveinterests. Much too long as well.
