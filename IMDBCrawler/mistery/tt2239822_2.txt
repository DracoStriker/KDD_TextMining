What if the Star Wars prequels had been handed over to a betterdirector? What if The Force Awakens and Rogue One had aimed at beingoriginal and fun science fantasy films rather than just playing onpeople's nostalgia?This is what I found myself seeing as I was watching Valerian. A filmthat made Space Opera's fun and exciting again.I was surprised by the two leads. The trailers made it feel like we'dbe seeing a rehash of the two main leads from Ender's Game but I wassurprised at how fun and spunky (and flawed) the two characters were towatch. The romance was not there and it did not need to be therebecause this film is not a romance nor centered around a romance. This film is Luc Besson taking what people loved about the FifthElement and stretching it to the entire movie. And yes, it is true, it is visually the prettiest movie since Avatar.The kids I took with me to see this film had their eyes on the screenthe whole time, no bathroom break, no water break, just a visuallymesmerizing film that never tired its audience.My recommendation is to go see it on the bring screen to experience themarvel of it. It's a shame it is not available in IMAX.
