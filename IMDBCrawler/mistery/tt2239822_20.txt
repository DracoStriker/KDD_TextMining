Can you say 'Sharkboy and Lavagirl" part 2? Let me take that back. Thatwas a horrible insult to the original, as it's a much better writtenscreenplay than this heap of trash. Save your money and, if you reallyfeel the need to watch it, wait until you can do so free on the Cometchannel in a few months.
