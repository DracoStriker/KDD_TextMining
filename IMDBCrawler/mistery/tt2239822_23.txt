Luc Besson, one of our greatest directors in modern is badly influencedby his wife. I watched all of Luc Bessons movies and this is not a LucBesson movie, its a Virginie Besson-Silla movie with Luc Besson as a PRtrick..This movie is just a complete mess of storytelling without a guidinglight and great visual effects, but if i want a movie with visualeffects without storytelling, well, i play a game of tetris, at least iknow the purpose of tetris.I think Luc should keep his love life out of his creative talent,cause, i pay too see a Luc Besson movie, i don't pay to see a badlymade Virginie Besson-Silla movie.
