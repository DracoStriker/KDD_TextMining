Although I too enjoy super hero movies, action movies blah blah - theyare getting tired. Good directors can get the pacing, directing andacting so right that the same-ol story can be told while still beentertaining. Especially in science fiction, it seems there are nooriginal ideas any more.Then comes along Valerian - WOW! What a refreshing and imaginativeworld they've developed and an exciting movie they've created! Thetrailers truly do not do this movie justice. I watched this movie justfor Luc Besson, because the trailer made the movie look like the usualHollywood drivel. What I got instead was an extremely pleasing andoriginal story that was superbly executed.What I love about the movie is that the plot isn't your typical sci-fiplot. It plays like a detective story intermingled with action andamazing visuals, culminating in a very satisfying ending that made meyearn for sequels to learn more about the universe Besson has created.Well done! This movie deserves to live on! Watch it in the theaters andbe thrilled!
