The plot has many problems, the character development has many problemsand the Visual Effects cannot save the poor script and acting. Iwonder, after so many years of American Blockbusters, do people stilllike these kind of cliché story lines?In no way this one can be compared to the beautiful 5th Element by thesame director. It is good if you want to watch a Disney-like film withyour children.
