seriously one of worst written and acted movies I've seen. Should haveleft and asked for my money back.Dane Dehann should not have been the lead. There was zero chemistrybetween him and Cara Delvingne.1 star because the special affects were great and 1 star because Carawasn't bad.Everyone else crapped the bed. Maybe it was the script, maybecombination of both. I just know I want my 2+ hours of life back
