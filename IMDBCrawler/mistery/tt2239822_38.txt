The first 10 minutes were a bit slow, but you began to get immerse inthis universe. Soon you forget it is a movie and it is a wonderfuljourney (I did see the 3D version). I grew up in France and I read theValerian comic in the 70's so I see more Star Wars taking referencefrom Valerian than the reverse but I can understand the weirdness ofthis world for an American viewer. In fact most critics did not get onthis superb epic.
