This movie is not a masterpiece, but it is excellent and veryentertaining, truly a summer blockbuster. Visuals are stunning, actionand comedy very good. Actors are more then OK, especially CaraDelevingne. So, I am satisfy, and I left cinema with a big smile on myface. Only one problem is there: why nobody in America watch thismovie? Why this movie flopped at America box office? This is mystery tome. My recommendation: go see this, you wont be disappointment...
