Valerian and the city of a thousand planets is a must see movie for thewhole entire family. I saw Valerian in Real D 3D and it was Fantastic.This was a great film that will keep your mind asking for more. I haveseen a lot of Sc Fi movies, but this has been the best one by far. Theacting was on point the whole time from the very start till the endcredits. Rihanna was great as her role as Bubble.Parents Valerian is rated Pg-13, but to be honest I did not see whybesides the action and the flirting between Valerian and his partner. Ireally think the little ones will love this marvelous film full ofbright colors. This movie is one in the history books for being a unique film that wasa masterpiece for ever and everMy score for Valerian 10/10
