Disclaimer: I never read any of the comic books. This review is for themovie only.I cannot be more specific. This movie is a super mix of "Dune" (1984,David Lynch's cut)+"Avatar"+"Star Wars"+"Guardians of theGalaxy"+"Babylon 5".And more specifically:There is the secret super-power substance, the source of life and thefree people who use it - thus the spice "melange" and the Fremen from"Dune" (represented by pearls in "Valerian").Different races of intelligent species with different abilities, justlike the houses and the home planets from "Dune".All together they live in a single place, just like in "Babylon 5".The wild nature and the blue nature-bound people from "Avatar".The colors, the jokes and the action from the "Guardians of theGalaxy". Maybe there is a pinch of the Douglas Adams jokes too.The rebels from "Star Wars". There is even a copied scene from "StarWars Episode IV" - where Luke liberates Leia for first time, she wearsnice white dress.This movie set the bar way too high beyond everything we've ever seen.Visually the movie is stunning. Far beyond "Avatar", but also we are inthe year of 2017, where technology is more advanced. Great music, coolstory.In short - definitely worth seeing.The way I see it - the next episode will continue in the style of"Dune" - we need to get more insight of the different races, more localheroes, more insight on the super pearls.I am curious - would we see the sleeper awaken?
