First of all, this movie is visually stunning, even though most of thescenes are CGI, its still look realistic, its gorgeousand then the design, from the buildings to the spaceships, to thewardrobe and makeup, it all looks wonderful and colorfullfor me, as a non-reader of the book/comics this movie is like acombination of Star Wars and Avatar the storytelling for me was a bituneven but the storyline was goodfor me Cara Delevingne as Laureline was better and perfectly cast thanDane Dehaan as The Valerianthats all i could say, i don't know too much about this movie, but whati know and all i could say is this movie is amazing, its visuallystunning movie, the story was good, the characters were amazingDefinitely recommended for Scifi lovers
