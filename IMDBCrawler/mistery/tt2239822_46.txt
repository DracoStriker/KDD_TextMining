Whoever gave one star to this movie deserves to be banned from the IMDbwebsite! Really, people? Really? I will tell you what is a one-starmovie - a minute-long off-focus video of pooping bear. How is thatcompared with the spectacular, beautiful, wonderfully shot pleasure forthe eyes, which the Valerian is? Why I loved the movie: First, it isabsolutely beautiful! There are spectacular views, all the aliens areso thoughtfully represented and original. The scene on the Mull planetwas also very beautiful. Then we have the main characters, which arefresh, cute and act decently. I must say Laureline is a much moreadequate female character, compared with princess Leya or Padme. She isbad ass, smart, sexy and cynical - really a strong independent woman,without bragging about it. The story was not too original, but it wasenough to keep me interested the whole time. It is based on a comicsafter all! 100% worth watching and needs a sequel!
