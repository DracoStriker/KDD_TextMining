Admit the actors didn't give a good performance but their characterswere secondary to the story. Finally a Sci-fi movie inspired by realhistory that dares to talk about important issues of our society aswell as show what true love is. I especially liked the part where thespace African dressed people that lived in paradise finally managed touse their own science (based on peace because they were hugging, notwar and destruction like the evil humans) to recreate their home-world.Really powerful message.Also a good lesson in morals (for the kids watching!!!) was whenValerian finally understood true love for his girl and forgot about hisorders and logic and being a soldier and gave the blue alien peoplereparations for when the evil commander destroyed their world long agoin a space battle.Rhianna also put on a very good performance, too bad her character diesat the end but at least she died like an Egyptian queen in that pile oftrash where it happened. This movie should be a series, we need more ofthese to educate people about how to behave towards other races anddifferent people.
