Wow... what a mess! Great potential. That's the only positive thingthis movie has to offer. Oh. And great CGI. The rest - Bad acting,worse writing and even worse plot. Baby actors playing at beinggrown-ups and failing miserably. Weak one liners that only re- enforcethe superficial meaningless direction most American movies take thesedays.Seriously do not waste your time with this movie. A waste of time and awaste of a movie to make. What could have been done with these millionsthat Hollywood waste on these kind of movies? A lot! People could nowbe alive, that would otherwise die from nutritional deprivation andhomelessness. It's time this crap stopped and it time people showed the courage torate it lower and let the people that made this unwatchable mess thatit's not acceptable anymore.It's not a 6 out of ten movie for anyone with Intelligence. Themindless masses will love this. It's bright and flashy with nosubstance - welcome to 2017.
