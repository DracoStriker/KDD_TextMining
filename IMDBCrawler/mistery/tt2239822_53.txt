I've read the whole series of Valerian comics as I'm of Europeanorigin. But this movie, although based on their characters andsituations, is actually a totally new adventure! And it is incrediblywell done, with amazing sequences and very original story line. Thereare some well known characters beyond Valerian and Laureline, butothers are completely new and AMAZING! Bubble's dance is so original Iwas truly speechless watching it. Superb, original idea! Well done, LucBesson and whoever refined this story. It is without a doubt one of thebest sci-fi movies I've ever seen - and I've seen most of them!
