Well the title is a mouthful so let's just refer to it as "Valerian"; Iknew what to expect from the title alone, and boy I wasn'tdisappointed, ultra futuristic like nothing you've ever seen before.The effects used from start to finish can only be described asgroundbreaking, never before have I seen anything so vividlyconstructed, the core of the film looks like an acid trip it's thatlucid, bright crisp colours dominate the whole landscape, even themurkier scenes are hauntingly beautiful, such as the one's at themetropolis known as Alpha, the city of a thousand planets; it just goesto show how far technology has come when films like this can be made. Even an appearance by Rihanna playing the role of Bubbles couldn'ttarnish the film, and that's saying something because the girl justcan't act..., credit to the relatively unknown leads, Dane DeHaan asour titular hero and Cara Delevingne as Valerian's partner and hopefullove interest Laureline, their acting is fluid and they have seeminglynatural chemistry together. Admittedly I'd never heard of the stories and comics of Valerian andLaureline going into the film, and was pleasantly made aware that thisparticular universe had been going for quite some time after doing anappropriate level of research; the film was so good it has peaked myinterest and I would love to pursue further material to expand myknowledge on these stories and this universe, also here's hoping thatthe producers decide to follow this first film up with a sequel (ormaybe two or three but that would be greedy wouldn't it?).Yes some would criticise "Valerian" and give the film a rather lowscore, and I'll admit that's fair, to appreciate the film as I have,you need to possess an open mind and a good working knowledge of Sci-Fiand the principals of Sci-Fi, to some it is obviously too far-fetchedand too out there to be enjoyable......Let's just agree that "Valerian" is like marmite, you either love itor you hate it, I'm just one of the people that happens to love it!
