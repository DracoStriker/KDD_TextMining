Luc Besson has come a long way since working as a marine biologist whomade films about dolphins. If you loved The Fifth Element with BruceWillis that came out 20 years ago this week then, this is the movie foryou.Avitar meets Gardians meets super sexy girl. I laughed. I sighed. Ilaughed. 3D was awesome. Don't take life too seriously! See this movieat the cinema. It's worth it.I don't want to spoil anything but, if you feel that there is somethingwrong with our reality and that the multiverse is converging then youwill find all the answers you need in this film. I love Valarian andThe City of blah blah blah!
