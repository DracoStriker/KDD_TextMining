My first review ever, but after seeing Valerian and the City of aThousand Planets i had too, since most reviews disregard the love andenergy the film was made. It is absolutely spectacular to watch inevery corner its filled with mind-boggling imagination of alien worldsand creatures.Being a star wars fan for the last 40 years i have to sayeat your heart out Mr. Lucas and co . Now I am a fan of Mr Besson sinceThe Big Blue , but this is his finest work so far please judge foryourself but see it and i promise you a ride of just over two hourswere you forget anything and escape in a wonderful future with amazingoptical dreams. Just wonderful.
