I have never written a movie review in my life but I was so outragedafter taking my family and some friends to see Valerian I have decidedto try and save some other poor soul from falling for the specialeffects trap. I must admit the beautiful visual effects of this moviedrew me in like the blue glow of a bug zapper.The visual effects were stunning and the race of people central to theplot were well crafted and engaging. But when the CGI charactersdeliver more believable and emotional performances than the actors, youknow your in trouble.Dane Dehaan is terrible. I don't think I have ever seen him before but,he sounds like he is trying to give his best Keanu Reeves impression.If that is his natural voice I feel for him, because it sounds forcedand at times comical.The two leads do nothing to draw you into the story and not once did Ifeel there was any chemistry between the two actors. Delevingne comesacross as an annoying B and you never find yourself hoping the twoleads will work out their differences. I simply did not care aboutthese people.Slick visuals and special effects cannot carry a movie alone, you stillneed dialogue, good actors to project chemistry and emotion that drawyou into the story.I guess what I learned from this experience is not to be fooled by thespecial effects and wait for week two or three before spending over$80.You can polish a turd all you want, in the end it's still a turd.
