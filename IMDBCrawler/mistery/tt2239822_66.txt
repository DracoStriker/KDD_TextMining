0Went to this movie last night. Not sure what movie the lack lustremoaning critics attended but it certainly wasn't Valerian!It is a great shame when movie critics feel compelled to trash moviesjust to justify their existence. Critics need to feel empowered and torealise that slating a movie is most certainly not the way to have asustainable career, especially when they are just simply and plainlywrong. Strong plot played out in an imaginative and thought provokingway. Unlike many critically acclaimed movies, where the script ispredictable and fed on a plate to non thinking audiences this movie wasentertainment personified. Critics have entirely missed the fact thatpeople pay to see this movie precisely for what it delivers! It is whatit is and what it was designed to be, not what critics consider itought to be, for that we have King Lear!If you want to be entertained, not predictably bored, if you want yourchildren to be captivated, not subjected to the usual stuff, then takethem along, safe in the knowledge that Valarian delivers on ALL fronts.Forget what the film critics have to say, most don't even watch themovies they critique! I enjoyed it and so did my daughter. Very muchworth going along and oh, don't forget to smuggle in drinks and snacksto avoid £9 (hot dog and coke!).
