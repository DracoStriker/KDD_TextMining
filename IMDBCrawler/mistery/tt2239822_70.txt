Another good epic film from Luc Besson. I watched the film in 3D and Ican tell you that this film is amazing. First of all before I gofurther with the review, you need to know that this film is based oncomic book, which means is more suitable for youngsters. I'm 41 yearsold and I liked it. Why I liked it? Because of the stunning script,adventurous story, visual effects, thousands of alien characters andspecies, unpredictable scenes, the introduction of the film where ittells you how Alfa city was created, and finally the creativity of LucBesson to show different dimension of the future. This film is notabout dialog or super acting. You don't need that in this film, this isan adventurous film set in the future based on comic book. For me thisfilm is better than Avatar which I think it was more like a fairy talein space, while this one is a proper sci-fi movie. You must watch it in3D.......Luc Besson never disappoints
