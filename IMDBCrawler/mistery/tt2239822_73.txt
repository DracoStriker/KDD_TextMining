This... This is so nothing. %80 of the movie relies on cgi and not goodkind of cgi. It's hard to believe that this comes from the same guywho've made the Léon: The Professional. The dialogue is bad, acting isbad, no character depth, storyline is obnoxious... And the scene thatRihanna dances. Oh my spaghetti monster. I hardly contained myself fromscreaming ''What was the point of that scene?'' and throwing what everI'm holding at that moment to the screen. This was almost as bad asSuicide Squad. Just think about that. What is the key elements ofmaking an above- average science-fiction/action movie that takes placein the future or in another dimension? Choose a main subject thathasn't been used for hundreds and thousands of times, make itconsistent, pace it well, make us care for the characters and put areason behind the action scenes which we will care. This movie fails ateverything I've just stated, and it doesn't even look good despite allthat cgi. Who gives a f.ck about a rat which swallows a pearl and crapsout hundreds of it? I take a crap every day. It does not feel importantor vital or a big deal.P.S: Dane Dehaan was in The Amazing Spiderman 2, it sucked; CaraDelevinge was in the suicide squad and it sucked. Coincidence?
