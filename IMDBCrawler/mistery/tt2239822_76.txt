Film is quite different from the mainstream Hollywood top sellers wherepredictable plot, revenge of the attractive, almighty protagonist whohas lost a dear and mass, super loud killing of whoever with bloodydetails is a norm. Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planet sparkleswith beauty of both idea and its representation, offering deepphilosophical attitude to the world at so many levels. In the same timeit is funny and keeps the audience attracted to the end so that 2:30hours pass really fast. Good play of the main actors - DeHaan andDelevingne - both quite specific as actors themselves, having their owncharm. The film is logical continuation of the idea set out in Avatarand perfectly performed in terms of visual effects to make it even morepersuasive. Enjoy watching it!
