The opening credits have to go down in movie history as the greatestopening credit sequence of all time. The rest of the film is prettygood, too.When I saw Herbie Hancock's name pop up on the screen I asked myselfcould this be THAT Herbie Hancock? Noooo, it couldn't be THAT HerbieHancock; but it was, and he comported himself well.Even though I know the earth is flat and space is fake I still enjoyedthe movie. Hey, I still like Star Trek and Star Wars even though we arenever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever going to fly on a space ship inspace. Nobody landed on the moon. There is no rover on Mars. There isno international space station orbiting the planet and satellites donot exist. It's called science fiction for a reason. What NASA is doingwith $19.6 billion dollars of taxpayers money is anybody's guess. Theysure aren't wasting it on production values.This movie is really good science fiction. If you liked the 5th Elementyou will like this flick. Hey Hollywood; this is how you make a movie.First you begin with a great story. Then you refine it until you have afinished screenplay. Next, you wait for the technology to allow you tomake a good movie. Use only the amount of special effects to augmentthe story. Do not let the special effects overwhelm the rest of thepicture.
