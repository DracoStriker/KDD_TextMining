Oh good lawd! What did they say to Dane DeHaan?!?! This is below him!!He is such a talented actor! Remember seeing him in in treatment (TVseries) and was blown away by his acting! This is a stereotypicalsurfer dude roll he's doing and it is so cringey!! I haven't even begunto dig into the production, which is laughably mediocre! I'm all forSGI, but don't spoil the whole movie with it...and don't do it if itisn't good enough (which it wasn't!)
