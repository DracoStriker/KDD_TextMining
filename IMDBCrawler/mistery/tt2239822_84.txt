Definitely a good watch. Even though it's quite long, at 2h10min, Icould barely feel the time pass.It doesn't have a brilliant story, but each moment is filled withvisual wonder, some funny scenes here and there and no boring moment. Ienjoyed the fact that even after 2/3 of the movie, I still didn't foundout what exactly was going on. Compared with the other sci-fi/fantasymovies out there where they do the whole exposition in the very first10 mins and then watch 90mins of exactly what you expect to happen,Valerian was definitely packed with some surprises.
