MUCH effort in the this movie on the part of the actors, FX and littleon the the story. Maybe get an award for film over used FX as withoutthem there really is not much left for plot."Whenever there's a new tool, everybody goes crazy and they forget thatthere's a story and that's the point. You're telling a story usingtools, you're not using tools to tell a story." - George Lucas.
