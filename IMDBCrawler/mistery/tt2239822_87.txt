Let me start by saying that the movie was stunning. The first scenealready made me think it was going to be a ten out of ten, the newAvatar, a real beauty that was being ignored by everyone because ofSpiderman and other big movies. Unfortunately, the acting and the plot(especially the love plot) ruined the whole movie for me. I only stayedbecause of the aliens, especially the Pearls were amazing! There was no chemistry between Delevingne (Lauraline) and DeHaan(Valerian), and for the first few minutes, I thought they were brotherand sister. But no. I know it's probably adapted from the comic,something they couldn't change for the movie, but it made me roll myeyes so much I probably missed half the movie. So many scenes that werecreated to show their "chemistry" could've easily been cut out of themovie and it would've saved us half an hour. In my opinion, the moviewould've been so much better if they were just brother and sister, ofjust friends. I wish the movie was more focused on the mission, more focused on thebackstory of the Pearl people, more focused on the other species thatlived on Alpha. Hell, I wouldn't even have minded three more sceneswith Rihanna (Bubble.)So much potential wasted on another science fiction movie with a crappylove story.
