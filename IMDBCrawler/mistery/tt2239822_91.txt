I went into Valerian with very low expectations. It is not the type iffilm I enjoy and the casting choices had me uneasy but because of this,the film was a nice surprise. Its not great, not by a long shot. Thenegatives for me were mainly that the plot got a bit lost in places,some wasted potential on a discussion of morality in conflict and themost wasteful, unnecessary love plot I have seen for a while. However,the positives were that acting was much better than I expected, theconcepts were original in places and the whole film is visuallystunning. I would recommend it if you like sci-fi or just want to enjoya simple, good-looking film.
