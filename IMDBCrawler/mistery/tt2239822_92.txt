The movie portraits a couple of young agents played by not really soaccomplished yet actors who, instead of in-and-out mission, getthemselves into much lengthier and complicated affair involving theirown political government bunkum. They do face difficulties, on purposecreated by the scenario writer, and compound the problems with theirown exaggerated poor judgment to make the movie last.This pair is also supposed to be in love, but as many other reviewsnoted, this fact does not get played out well at all. The male leadappears to be explicitly obnoxious trying to pass it for a charm. Thefemale lead, in turn, does not find obnoxiousness charming.The name 'Valerian' refers to a series of French comics that may not bethat well recognized by general audience nowadays. And at any rate this'major' Valerian, is nothing like the 'major' portraited by BruceWillis in the 'Fifth Element', but rather lieutenant junior over-promoted by, no doubt, big fat mistake. On the positive side, the adventures are very colorful with unusualsupportive CGI-born characters and scenery. Seems like a bland review? That is exactly how movie feels. It does notproduce desire to look up the soundtrack, adopt a catch-phrase,re-experience it of DVD to notice and understand some minor details,or, at least, buy the same watch the main hero is wearing.______________ SPOILERS BELOW___________________The common sense and science limp on both legs in this one. Examplesare below.How do you transport the most valuable animal ever? Surely, not in aspecially made ship with multiple guards, artificial nativeenvironment, fountain to wash the paws in, and behind a thick vaultdoor with inscription 'Keep the f out, please'. No. In a bag on a beltof a sergeant next to a couple of grenades! You know, just so itwouldn't think too much of itself and start demanding extra dry catfood for lunch. The animal to its credit is very patient ? does notcomplain, bite or croak from mistreatment.The ads really give hope for Rhianna to be a major character, apositive or negative, but a major one, who appears in multiple scenesand carries a weight of a memorable heroine. Instead, it is a oneoverlong episode with bitter end, because the shape-shifter could notshift the shape to avoid obscure mechanical injuries. The overgrown dog-lizard chasing agents at the beginning is a practicalcopy of the one from 'John Carter' movie, only with lesser number oflegs - probably, to avoid legal suite for plagiarism. It also issomehow bullet proof. The amount of fire it took would have shreddedseveral elephants, but it did not seem to be even slightly discommoded. The female lead gets captured by a fishing rod with a butterfly as abait - amazing dumbness from a special agent on high alert. Moreover,she gets grabbed by two barehanded brutes and dragged away without anyresistance while wearing a special gear suit. That same augmented suithelped her 'romantic interest' partner earlier in the movie, where hemanaged to punch through walls and transverse liquid and gaseousenvironment without changing his breath. It got to be women andgadgets, right?Conclusion: Luc Besson is a human and does make mistakes from time totime. This movie is one of them.
