My group of six+ sci-fi geeky friends agreed with my summary title:"Visually wonderful - but some weak portions & casting". Many of the FXvisuals were truly breathtaking and in my opinion 'masterpieces'. Butonce in awhile some of them were 'over kill' - like the 'MARKET' andthe 'PLEASURE PLACE'. Also, I felt no real magical, love sparkconnection between the two leads. And maybe I am too old to beobjective in such matters, but in my opinion the male lead was theweaker of the two. Even as BUBBLES, Rhianna, had more oomph than him.She will become a true SUPER STAR in she keeps improving.
