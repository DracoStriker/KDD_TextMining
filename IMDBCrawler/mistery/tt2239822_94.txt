As a big fun of science fiction movies I was very excited when Valerianmovie was announced.However, starting from the first minute of watching I realized howridiculous the movie was. Most of the actors among the federationrepresentatives are kids or have childish faces that look amateur. Thedistant future military personnel carry HK416 (Heckler & Koch) assaultrifles developed in 2005 (which looks really lame, since others haveblaster rifles/pistols). The devil is in the details my friends. Theplot itself is weak and does not reflect the epic depth that this moviecould have achieved. There are many episodes where acting does not makeany sense whatsoever.This movie would be a thumbs up for 7 years oldkids who has absolutely no idea what a good science fiction movie is.Verdict: Valerian and the City of Thousand Planets is OK as a graphicalnovel for kids, but not for true science fiction fans. Despite my lovefor Luc Besson's work I would rate it 4 out of 10.
