I'm a huge fan of SpiderMan. I was grown up with this hero's movies,animated television, etc. I'm the one who always likes Peter'sinvention. I think many of you might think like me about his suit. Itseemed to be a big nothing if Tony Stark wasn't helping Peter with histech support but if you watch this movie and open your mind. you'llunderstand what he wants to prove himself like as Tony said "If you'renothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it." So In myopinion it's this version that finally puts a truly portrayal of#PeterParker. Tom did great job. I love it.I've watched it in three projection systems. In my personal opinion 4DXis kind of exhausting.. but it would be more fun if you see it in thenormal screen or IMAX first. I always prefer #IMAX as it enhances mymovie going experience. Moreover, I've seen Peter's face on big screenwith full of my eye.
