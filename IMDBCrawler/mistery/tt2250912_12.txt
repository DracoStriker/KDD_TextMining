Oh Spider-Man, we meet again. It's been a long time since we sawtantalizing Tobey Maguire in the suit. Spidey was in need of acomeback- oh wait, I forgot that already happened...Andrew Garfieldthis one is for you! Okay but for real, this movie was great. It hit on every truthfulaspect of Peter Parker. Geeky high school teen with great angst, a needto prove himself and get the girl he supposedly loves. I would 10/10recommend it to anyone as one of the greatest Marvel movies every made(it definitely lived up to it's reputation), but what about thegreatest Spidey movie every made? I agree that there has to be major differences between this movie andthe other two heart-throb tales because Spider-Man is now official inleague with the Avengers. But caught in the crossfires of the MarvelLegacy, was the movie even about Peter Parker? I mean, did they evenhave to try to make it about him? Everybody already knew the story sowhy bother retelling it? I believe a better title for the movie mayhave been Iron Man 4-Tony Stark's Coming of Age. The Marvel makers seemed to have realized that they already created avast empire so adding in Peter Parker shouldn't be difficult at all; ifwe remember to keep the main stars close behind... I may still be a little too attached to the previous web of spideymovies to believe that Spider-Man is now part of something more thanjust himself, but it may have been nice to stick a little closer to thereality of Spider-Man's true nature. He is a lonely, angsty teen fromqueens, but he seemed to be still on the back burner to the biggerstarts cameo-ed in his own film. Maybe that was the pointthough...right?
