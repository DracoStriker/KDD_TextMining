"Spider-Man: Homecoming" is the newest installment in the MarvelCinematic Universe and a much needed Spider-Man reboot after the messthat the "Amazing Spider-Man" series were. This movie is actually a tiewith Raimi's "Spider-Man 2" for the best movie based on the characterand Tom Holland, after this movie and his debut in last year's "CivilWar" is easily the best on-screen Spidey.What I loved about this film is that it manages to introduce us toPeter Parker without showing us things that we know from all hispreviews movies. And if you don't think that's great enough, preparefor a funny, lighthearted, surprising, easter-egg filled,action-packed, stunning Summer blockbuster.It's also one of those rare comic book movies that the villain doesn'tfeel wasted, thanks to Michael Keaton's flawless performance. The restof the cast does a great job too - with Zendaya being a standout, to mysurprise.To conclude, I believe "Homecoming" is a nearly perfect adaptation ofthe beloved Web shooter with barely any flaws that every fan (andnon-fan) should see.
