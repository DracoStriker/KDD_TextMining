I must say that, as a Marvel Fan, I am deeply impressed with this newmovie. I know that this Spidey is not really in line with the classicalcomics but I have to admit that this movie has an outstanding storyplot. Even the Spiderman's suit, that Tony Stark has made for him, isreally impressive with all these high tech features and webcombinations and Jennifer Connelly was really talented when she playedthe A.I. for it (Similar to F.R.I.D.A.Y in the Iron Man suit). MichaelKeaton played a BAD-ASS Super-villain and that has scored a lot ofpoints as well. As a huge Iron Man fan, I admired the support andmotivation that Stark has given to Peter Parker as an Inspirational andCharismatic Mentor (Hoping that Robert Downey Jr. can win an Oscar for"Best Supporting Actor" in this movie). Overall I believe that TomHolland has played a cool and hip Spider-Man similar to Ryan Reynold'sDeadpool except with more comical but juvenile humor. I know thatpeople say that he is too young to play the Spidey role but I thinkthat we should give him a chance to continue to do so since he hasproduced promising results form this Hollywood Masterpiece. Who knows,he might even stun millions of viewers in the upcoming Avengers Movies.Good Job ;)
