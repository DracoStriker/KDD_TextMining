FINALLY!!!! This is the version of Spider-Man that I've been waitingYEARS for. Tom Holland nails both Peter Parker, and Spider-Man soperfectly, giving each of them a distinct personality. Robert DowneyJr. is used sparingly and never intrudes on Spider- Man's movie andeven feels like a father figure at some points. Michael Keaton KILLS asthe Vulture and gives Marvel one of its greatest villains to date.Everyone else gives there A-game in Marvel's top 5 best movies to date.Yes, there are some jokes that don't land and yes, this does feel likea John Hughes movie with Spider-Man perfectly stuffed in rather than asuper-hero movie, but writing is perfect, the story is AMAZING (wink,wink), and overall, it's a well directed, well made movie. Everyoneinvolved should be proud of themselves. So in all, watch it, then watchit again. SIDE NOTE/SPOILER: STAY TIL THE END OF THE CREDITS IF YOUWANT MARVEL TO GIVE YOU THE FINGER. WORTH IT.
