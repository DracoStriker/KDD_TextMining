*SPOILER WARNING*I loved this movie! Definitely the best movie in the MCU, bestsuperhero movie in years. the way peter webbed around new York amazedme. 2 hours of greatness. The part when peter first puts on his suit isincredible. One of my favorite scenes was when spider-man saves hisfriends from the Washington monument, it was very intense... The musicplayed well with the scenes and made it more intense. Tom Holland isthe right actor for this part, acts more like a teenager than the firsttwo actors who have portrayed this character. Robert downy Jr played agood part in this movie, Tony acted like a mentor to peter, after Brucebanner left, tony felt lonely and wanted a friend... Thats where petercame in. Some parts were hilarious, the scene where Ned was in thecomputer room and the woman asks why he is in there after school, hereplies with "I was looking at, porn" very funny scene... There wasmany intense scenes during this movie, like vulture and peter arefighting on the avengers plane, also the scene where Adrian (vulture)and peter where in the car before the homecoming dance, it makes youfeel scared for whats coming. The A.I in the suit was amazing, justlike iron man... The scene where peter first puts on the suit without'THE TRAINING WHEELS PROTOCOL' is cool... I love how he is ACTUALLY atteenager in this movie, makes it feel that spider-man is one of us...Just a normal teen. It makes it a lot better than the others because itdoesn't go through all the things about uncle Ben and the story on howhe get his powers... Every fan knows that... They have perfected itthis time.
