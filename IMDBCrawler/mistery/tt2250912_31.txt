Considering this is the sixth Spider-Man film since the start of thenoughties. It is really positive the fact Marvel was able tosuccessfully bring in so many fresh ideas. It is also worth noting howmany good jokes they were able to get into the film that had not beencovered in the previous five. Obviously, one thing that was anadvantage to this film is it went into an already established cinematicuniverse when the others didn't have that advantage. Tom Hollandportrayal was witty and linked all the other characters really well. Itwas also nice to see Gwenyth Paltrow make a cameo as Pepper Potts. Niceto see the appearances of two new villains on the big screen but atthis point, I would be curious to see the green goblin return. Sooverall I would definitely recommend this movie.
