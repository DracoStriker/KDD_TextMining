Spiderman has always been my favorite movie but I am one of thosepeople who is so love struck with Tobey Maguire's rendition ofSpiderman that I believed no one else could do it justice and then inwalks Tom Holland who does such an amazing job I just have to give himhis props. (Truth be told I dragged myself there to see Donald Gloveras I was sure I'd be disappointed but I wanna see it 10 more times)
