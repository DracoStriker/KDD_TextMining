Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketchparodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but mostimportantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's visionby far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation fromregular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to thefranchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (whodoesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate wasquintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddySpiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably,because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that "goofy" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as asuperhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenagehumor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection betweenSpiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not abig spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back andforth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to bedesired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying theearnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy.BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superheromovie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, hisrelation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, youmust look elsewhere...
