This is what I was afraid of when Disney took over marvel,it shouldhave been called Spider-Man,high school musical ,I know it,s comic-bookmovie ,but we came a long way to show that comics are not just for kids,but this sets us back ,none of the characters are like they are in thecomics ,Peter was a nerdy school kid but not like this ,flash was a bigschool bully ,but this flash is a wimp ,my grandmother could take him,and aunt May is a hottie in this movie ,not the old caring aunt of thecomics ,why ,why ,hope this is not a trend ,the suits sucks too.i knowthey are trying to hit a new up to date audience ,but really.goodgraphics and action but lame characters and story .guess I,m justgetting old .
