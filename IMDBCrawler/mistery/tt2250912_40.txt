I felt like this spider man movie was over the top. The high schoolsetting made it feel like a true spider man movie where a kid wants tobe a hero. The moment we all know is when peter parker runs into thealleyway and and rips his shirt off showing his spidey symbol. I thinkTom Holland did a fantastic job at acting in this film. But the onlydull part is, it didn't have as much action packed moments as Iexpected, being a long time Michael Bay fan, I've gotten used to theexplosions and action packed scene. But very well done movie!
