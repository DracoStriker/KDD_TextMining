i can say i honestly loved it, i love tom's portail as spider-man/peterparker i love how his love interest is liz instead of Gwen or MJ thistime to avoid similarities speaking of which i do love how the decidedto skip the origin story which would of be fine if it was the AndrewGarfield story arc but in the MCU, but anyway the high tech version ofvulture was actually amazing the relationship between peter and tonyand happy is great, and the ending that hints for the sinister six toshow up with tombs and Gargan, i have to say have been waiting sincesandman showed up in 3 and then again at the end of amazing 2 with allthe cameos , but i few things really did bug me, flash Thompson beingone of the, like spiderman and the amazing spider man were pretty closewith the whole school bully thing but the the MCU... i was hoping forsomeone who actually looked like he could be flash but honestly he isthe exact opposite, and the other MJ like what?! i kind would rathershe didn't show up at all then it be someone whose name isn't actuallyMary Jane Watson let alone looks anything like her, i know people arechanging but.. really mj...really? i just hope its slows down a bitsince the 1st guy to play shocker looked more like him then the 2ndguy, i know comic back in the day were a bit umm colour friendly andeven though i am dark skinned it still really bugs me that it happensso much like i love Donald Glover but when people said Donald for PeterParker i still went nah better as miles, by the way i am so glad he wasstill in the movie, but Fury, Flash, MJ, Shocker the list goes on forboth DC and Marvel, Also i really hope they don't ruin venom byskipping straight to a solo movie rather than later dawing the symbiotfist then passing it on to eddie vire the bell tower that's just toiconic to skip and then carnage maybe even toxin, saw a photo ofCameron Monaghan as Carnage/Cletus Kasady and i think it would be afantastic choice just throwing that out there. sorry for getting offtopic kinda but all in all still loved the movie, can't wait to seewhat follows.
