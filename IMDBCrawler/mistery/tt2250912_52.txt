I hope that this will be the first Marvel Movie to create history andwin some classic Academy Awards for the best picture. For instance,this movie deserves to win an award for the best CGI/Graphics. Thesecond once should be deserved for most outstanding story-line. Isincerely hope that Robert Downey Jr. will win an Oscar for bestsupporting actor since the Iron Man role has always suited himperfectly. Michael Keaton should win one for best villain since he hasmade the Vulture come to life for the audience. I believe that TomHolland still has a good way to go in the acting gig but he hasexceeded expectations in this Homecoming Fiasco and, who knows, maybehe might actually bring home a couple of Oscars for himself when hebecomes very well seasoned. :)
