This is definitely the best movie about Spider-Man. Marvel and Sonyhave finally got the character perfect both in and out of the suit. Hislink in the MCU just makes the movie that much better. Tom Holland isthe best Spider-Man and Peter Parker and you can't even compare him tothe previous 2. This movie is very fun and there are shocking plottwists to look forward to. It's definitely better than the original 2Sam Raimi movies without a doubt. And be sure to stay to the very veryend.
