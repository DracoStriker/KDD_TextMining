Spider-Man is literally the most loved Marvel hero of all time! Atlast, this reboot perfectly captured the balance between Peter Parkerand Spider-Man in the comics! Peter's awkward nature in high school andhis attempts at being a cool superhero are both relatable and funny.Tom Holland played a good Peter Parker with the nerdy, awkward way andhe manifested one of Spider-Man's significant traits: his sense ofhumor. The movie is full of Easter eggs and references to the comics,the previous Spidey movies, and the MCU as a whole. Not only does thismovie look really good, but the villain (Vulture) looks menacing as agreat villain should. How the hell did they make one of the silliestvillains awesome?? That's the Marvel Magic.
