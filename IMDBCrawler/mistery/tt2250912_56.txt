I have been waiting for a new spidey film for a long time and when thisfilm came out i was amazed by how good it was, i'm a huge spider-manfan and i thought that tom Holland did a great job a him, i lovedalmost every aspect of the movie but i noticed that the movie was justa bit to long but still a great film.
