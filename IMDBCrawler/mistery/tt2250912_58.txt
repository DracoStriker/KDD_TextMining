Seriously the worst Spiderman movie I've watched. The first threemovies in my opinion were the best. In this film Peter Parker isportrayed as a hyperactive, silly, and immature teenager. They make himseem very weak and unimportant compared to other avengers. FurthermoreI disagree with the use of gadgets and high tech suit. This is not howSpiderman should be portrayed and remembered. Honestly Spiderman is myfavourite superhero and I grew up with him, but with the originalSpiderman not this silly version and I'm just sad that people will nowhave this view of Spiderman instead of how Spiderman used to be andSHOULD be.
