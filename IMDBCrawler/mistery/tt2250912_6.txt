Now we have Spider-Man Homecoming (2017)!!! OK, true believers; let'sbegin with, NO ORIGIN STORY! Yes, finally, no more freaking originstory! We ALL know Peter gets bit by a radioactive spider which giveshim his powers. DONE! Point scored to fans! Let's move on. Second,Spider-Man Homecoming is still a Sony film but Marvel Studios has MUCHof the creative control when they struck a deal. What this means forfans is, we finally get to see a Spider-Man that we want! ... All inAll, this film hits a freaking home run! It's funny, action packed,great writing, true to the character/source material, and leads intosome serious Avenger easter eggs! I LOVED THIS version of Spider- Man!!I still love 2002's Spider-Man, but this is leading right into thefuture of the MCU. EXCELSIOR !!!!! Read my FULL review at www.superheroesultimate.com
