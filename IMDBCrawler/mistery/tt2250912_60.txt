I am amazed at how many Spider-man fans say this is the best Spider-manmovie ever. Really? It blows my mind. My favorite are those who sayit's Spider-man to the core. Really? Let's see...1) No Spider sense which is the main superpower he has. In what worldwould Ned, Aunt May, Vulture and Shocker surprise Spider-man in the waythis movie did?2) A talking suit? Really? This is Spider-man? I could talk about thisflaw forever! 5k web combinations made by Stark? Really? LOL!!!3) No deep driving motivation by the loss of Uncle Ben? The wholereason why Peter does what he does. Then there's Ned (funny but again anti- Spider-Man comics) and theconfusing Flash Thompson (jock meets geek character...what)?Honestly I could go on and on. All three Spider-man series had theirgood points. But none of them nailed it. Certainly not Homecoming.In fact this movie shouldn't have been Spider-man: Homecoming it shouldhave been called Spider-man: Iron-man Jr.
