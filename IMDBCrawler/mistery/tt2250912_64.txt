Yes. This may be a great coming of age movie, and a great superheromovie but not the greatest spider-man movie. I'm not being stubbornhere about the classic. I've seen reviews saying it is the best Spider-man movie ever. I can't agree with that because the villain and somesupporting characters are so underdeveloped. Tom Holland tries aultimate spider-man style but in the end all we get is the Kung-fuPanda version of spider-man. It was fun in civil war because it wasshort but here he keeps whining about it almost every minute when hewas Peter Parker. In overall, this is just another MCU popcorn movie.It's entertaining as hell, good to re-watch on Blu-ray and keep it inyour MCU collection. BTW, Tony stark was awesome once again.
