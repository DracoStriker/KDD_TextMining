I went in with no expectations and was delightfully surprised.I was disappointed that they changed the actor playing him again, butafter the opening sequence I was sold.It had action, character development, cool special effects-thatfurthered the story (and weren't just there to be pretty), and lots ofhumor. I'm trying to remember the last time I laughed this much in amovie. (Wonder Woman).I think this movie would be doing much better if they had stressed thatit wasn't a retelling of the origin story.The only reason I didn't give it a higher score was because the bestfriend got on my nerves (until the end).This is a really good super hero movie.
