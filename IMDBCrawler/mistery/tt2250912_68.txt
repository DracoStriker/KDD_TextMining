First of all I had to say I really have high expectations to this film,but the trailers did really ruin it for me, the trailers did almostshow the whole movie itself. But for me it didn't feel like aSpider-man/Iron-man movie.Lets start first with the character, Tom Holland portray Spider-man andPeter Parker really well he's probably the best Spider-man yet, MichaelKeaton did a good job on portraying the Vulture, and the othercharacters were also good, they did a good job on casting.The Film is kinda boring, the pacing slow but its not that bad, thefilm is more of a lighthearted movie than the others its more of amovie for teens but has fun moments for the adults specially for comicbooks fans, its has a teenage-ish feel but its okaythe action was not that bad but its not as exciting as the action inSam Raimi's Spiderman 1 & 2, i thought it there will be more actionscenes, but what you see in the trailers is what you getIt also didn't feel like a Marvel movie, it's so different from theothers, it feel like more of a Disney TV movie with a taste of marvelin it (THIS IS JUST MY OPINION) but hey it's Fun and visually appealingmovie, this movie is basically introducing Peter Parker on how hebecame the spider-MAN and introducing him in the avengersoverall this was above average movie, its GREAT!!!
