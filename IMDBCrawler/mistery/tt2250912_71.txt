Turns out this juvenile Spidey is a bad guy who would have sunk a boat,destroyed a historic monument because of his obnoxious ignorance andcrashed a plane into a city but all he got "lucky" and no casualtyoccurred, except enough property damages amounting to a cost whichcould easily surpass the budget of this film. All of this why? cause hejust wanted to avert a robbery!! Seriously? call police or simplemessage someone responsible about this instead of doing stupid tricksand putting everyone lives in danger! I hated this spider-man for hisutter immaturity and for no loyalty to the comics. This spidey is justa sham, tony is the hero here.Moreover, the vulture came out to be a good guy at the end! All he wasdoing is to make some money like Stark did in his earlier days! Insteadof sharing the tech with the world they made it illegal, what will aperson do who lost all his money? Sell that thing in the black marketcuz it's illegal now.
