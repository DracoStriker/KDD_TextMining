Let me just say something, Spider-Man homecoming can be described inthree words incredible ,funny and smart. It is a breath of fresh airand has unexpected plot twists which are really smart,and thecharacters are amazing there were well fleshed-out. And I thank Godthat we have a talented director like John Watts,he cares about makingthe side characters and the villain interesting which to be honest theMC failed at making me care for the side characters and villains.Speaking of the villain I'm proud to say that Michael Keaton gives onof the best performances I have ever seen doing and one of the best MCvillains and one of the best comic-book movie villains. This movie haslower stakes compared to other MC movies but,this is what makes itbolder the many comic-book movies is that it's not afraid to besmall-scaled and director John Watts does not compromise the smallscale of the movie just for some cheap action scenes with explosions,inconclusion I would like to say that Spider-Man homecoming is theperfect Spider-Man experience and the best Spider-Man movie filled withheart and humor 10/10.
