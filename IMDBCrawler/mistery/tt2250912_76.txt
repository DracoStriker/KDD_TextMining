All of this film is wrong.I'm 40 and I did love the first movies fromRaimi and with Tobey Mcguire. Maybe this movie is intended for 10 yearsold kids. Spiderman is not the one described on the marvel originalcomic. The actor ,Holland is so selfish that change hes profile imagineon IMDb with the spider on the chest of his costume.....then why,why doabort all of the main characters from toe comic in order to bepolitically correct!!!!!!! Michelle (hope , at the end ,she will notbecome our beloved red-haired MJ)is black. Flash is not more thetall,blond kid who insults peter parker, now its an Indian or somethinglike it that has nothing to do with the original carachter.Then thepeter-best friend,obviously an Asian. This politically correct wayalready failed with the fantastic four.I'm not racist but,if acarachter is meant to be white since the 1950's comics,they shouldrespect it. My little daughter sometimes watch Disney channel,and a fewtimes,Iwatch it with her.I've notice that programs like Jesse andBunk'd shows the same thing:a Chinese ,an Indian , a black and anispanic.No one realize that this is the real race discrimination?Spiderman homecoming did the same.There MUST BE an actor from everysingle RACIAL KIND.OK But just one thing scares me of: in all of this politically correctway Marvel has adopted,WHY THERE IS NOT A SINGLE NATIVE-Americanactor?!
