no substance, good action movie but that's about it. it could have beenany teenager facing what spider-man faced, so why calling it spider-manhomecoming. just call it homecoming. Not the best. the kid was tryingtoo hard to be part of the avengers. where is MJ on all this? whatabout aunt May, give me a break. I still remember when people said thesame thing about "the amazing spider-man"
