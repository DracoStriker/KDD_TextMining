I CAN NOT and WILL NO LONGER believe that these reviews are impartial.This movie is a joke - and the joke is played upon the viewer. The Plot- if you can call it a plot - is so thin that any FX (No matter how'cool') are just pure irrelevance. Don't get me wrong... the kidplaying Spider-Man - 'Tom Holland' - does a fine job - the supportingActors (Most of greater fame / experience and talent) also do theirs.The problem is... the PLOT - which, as stated above, is so cliché'd asto be worthless. Keaton does his usual ham-fisted approach to acting(perhaps I should have put 'ham' in uppercase). Robert Downey Jr. ishis usual blasé self (Obviously - he'd already been paid). To wasteMarisa Tomeis' skills is just an insult, not to mention Jon Favreau andGwyneth Paltrows' undoubted talent. The very fact that this moviereceived a 7.8 star rating is enough to show that rigging is inprocess. I'd go through the plot - bit by bit - to try and get acrossmy dismay at the so-called acclaim this piece of excrement received butI wouldn't want to waste 2 and a half minutes of your time - because,truly, that's about the length this movie should have been.
