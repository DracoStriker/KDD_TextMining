The movie wasn't just boring. It was also so corny. The girlfriendcomes in far too soon in the movie. She immediately becomes the purposefor everything. At first, I thought for sure she was one of Obama'sdaughters. Very disappointing. It is a great movie for 6th and 7thgraders. It was so juvenile it should have been in animation.
