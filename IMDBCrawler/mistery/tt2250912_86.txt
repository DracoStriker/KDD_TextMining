I love the MCU. I saw all Marvel's movies. Including the latest ones(Logan and Guardians 2). This movie sucks - all the previous moviesappealed to a more mature audience - this one (jokes, dialogues,storyline) looks like a teen movie.We (me and my wife) yawned A LOT - no action, boring sequences, teenromance scenes.If you put Logan, Luke Cage, Deadpool on one end (R Rating - depth,characters, story) - Spiderman: Homecoming will be DEFINITELY on theother one.
