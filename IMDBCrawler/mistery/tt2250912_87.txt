This Spider-Man can't do a lot a things right. The character inAvengers slugfest seems to have things together fighting wise. In thismovie he can't do anything right, does not seem smart enough to figureout the most obvious of answers to a problem, pines after Tony Starkfor most of the movie, and falls down constantly like balance really isnot his best attribute. Forget any spider sense, he does not have any.He basically has no self identity, but somehow magically finds it atthe very end of the movie. This is not Peter Parker, but rather anextremely bad rendition of one meant to appeal to the younger crowd.Tom Holland also has the wrong voice, just does not carry any weightwhen he speaks Honestly the most memorable character for the rightreasons was Michelle (MJ) played by Zendaya.The "love" interest was not all that interesting, Micheal Keaton wasgood, but his role was underused and ended up feeling rather flat as abad guy. Marisa Tomei is horribly miscast as Aunt May (one good scenefrom her). Peter Parker's buddy is just annoying at some point and hasno brains either. Tony Stark appeared way too much for this to actuallybe called a Spider-Man movie.An very forgettable movie and will not end up on my shelf.Technical details: Special effects for Spider-Man were not the best.Movements seemed somehow elongated at times like his body wasstretching weirdly at times when web slinging.This is a renter at best, not sure how they managed to pay off thecritics to say this was a good movie
