No Uncle Ben, Aunt May is young, MJ isn't MJ, Spider-Man has an Ironmansuit on, No Spidey Sense. A letdown in every sense of the word if youever read or cared about the comics. Tony stark is not the reasonSpider-Man is who he is. It all comes down to Uncle Ben saying to himwith great power comes great responsibility. Sam Raimi's 1st 2 Spider-Man movies are perfection as far as Spider-Man goes. Sad to see PeterParker turned into Ironman instead of just being Spider-Man.
