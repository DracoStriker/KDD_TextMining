The movie plot was so basic and they still had to explain throughdialog what was happening, so you'd know...Very little character development. Not even for this Parker... Youcling to what you know of spiderman of past stories to fill in thegaps, but, then the new character disappoints.Like all new movies, they can't seem to write things actuallyhappening. They need to look at old movies and remember how to shootand edit things so that actions happen. planking on top of a buildingshouldn't eat up 2 minutes of movie time...Can you imagine what editing and shooting must have been like with realfilm ?? And they still can't even come close to older flicks in termsof content and story... What is this? Lazy? Cheap? No longer any talentin the industry? Maybe they should stop focusing on politics and learnhow to make movies again.Spoilers....The suit thing is dumb, he becomes a "soft" version of iron man.. withwebs.. What happened to spidey sense? Maybe I missed it.Sorry, but, you need an actress for aunt May, not a body... just sayin.For all that happens in this movie, he saves like 2 people. He has tobe saved by iron man and his best friend. By the end of the movie, whodoesn't know he's spiderman?
