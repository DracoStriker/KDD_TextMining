How many more Spider-Man's are we supposed to adjust to ? I mean thescript just keeps getting rewritten all the time, aunt May keepsgetting younger in all the movies, Flash is an Indian guy ? No MJ orGwen, costume modifications. This is just too much to adjust to in oneMovie. It's like the whole universe of Spiderman is erased and a newone with major modifications is created. Look at the X-Men movies theystart with one and it goes on and in continuity but with these moviesreboots all over again. This is the 3rd one for Christ's sake. It'smore of an avengers movie then one for the Spidey fans.I could go onbut I am tired of these marvel universe.
