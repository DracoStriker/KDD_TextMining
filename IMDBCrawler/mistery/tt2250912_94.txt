Gave this a low 3 out of 10 because basically this new spiderman isjust 'baby ironman's junior high school days'. It wasn't a terriblemovie, but it's blatantly aimed at junior high/high school kids...which was weird because the theatre I was in on Fridsy evening wasmainly mid twenties and up... The story was OK and with this being thethird spidermen reboot since 2000, I guess they couldn't really havedone another 'boy gets bitten by spider, boys uncle gets killed, boybecomes good spiderman' movie, but I wish they had just made standalone spiderman. Not 'baby spiderman meets father figure Avengersmember Ironman'I think this movie was made to appeal to the 50 percent or so ofchildren in America being raised in a single parent household... greatfor them, but not so much for 35 year old, Toby maguire spiderman fanme.So overall s disappointing movie, not terrible, just far, far, far fromgreat.
