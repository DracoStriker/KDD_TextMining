Spider-Man: Homecoming, the latest addition to the MCU is oneexhilarating and breathtaking ride. By breathtaking, i mean itliterally does not give you enough time to breathe. It is packed withfabulous action sequences and time is not wasted on unnecessarycharacter introductions.So, is SM: HC the best Spider-Man movie till date? Well, let's just saythat once the final credits roll and you step out of the theater,you'll definitely feel so. For example, remember the time you thoughtMad Max: Fury Road was the greatest action movie ever for an entiremonth? Similarly, I don't think this movie will survive the test oftime. Die Hard released in 1988 still gets touted as the best actionmovie. SM 2 released in 2004 still gets talked about 13 years later. DoI think SM: HC will be talked about in 2030? Not a chance. A year downa line it's just going to be another movie in the vast collection ofthe MCU. That's not to say to this or Mad Max: FR are bad movies. In fact,they're great movies. It's just the rush you get soon after watchingthe movie makes it feel better than it is, I think. Let's wait and see.Then again, isn't that what movies are supposed to do? 9/10
