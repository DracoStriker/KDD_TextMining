Spider-Man: Homecoming is refreshing, exciting, funny and captivating.Tom Holland 'nails it', artfully combining the dichotomous attributesof human and superhuman, of fearful and fearless, into the mostrealistic and audacious Spider-Man character ever. Michael Keaton isthe King of Villains!The director and cast made a real connection with the audience tonight.At the conclusion of the opening show, more than five minutes after thecredits ended, I was stunned by the deafening roar of the fans, stillin their seats, discussing their favorite scenes as theater crewsscrambled to clean for the next sellout crowd.
