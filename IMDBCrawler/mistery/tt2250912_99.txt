This movie rocked! After having to ignore Spiderman during the Garfieldyears, it feels good that Spidey is home. Do not pay any attention to the critical or negative comments outthere. It is an exciting and funny film that falls perfectly in linewith the MCU and the build towards Infinity Wars. I am amazed andappreciative that Marvel has a formula that works for these films. thecharacters compliment each other well across films and I could not askfor more.Spiderman is a character that has endured and become more loved overthe years. and the theater I was in this weekend had fans in full forcedressed up in costumes and shirts and cheering/clapping/laughing duringthe film, in a good way.Thanks again Marvel, next up Thor!
