I loved it, I felt very identified as Mexican with my traditions, itmade me revalue the importance of celebrating this beautiful traditionthat is the Day of the Dead and imagine how our ancestors can walkamong us on this date. Great production by the Disney - Pixar duet.It's an action movie, there are multicolored characters, it hassuspense and a great end. I will watch it again!!!
