Beautiful, almost perfect, at last a movie that honors our roots andnot making fun with them. The music, the colors, the allusion to one ofour most beloved stars Pedro Infante, humor is excellent, not fallinginto racist jokes as all movies about Mexicans are, the voices, a lotof Mexican talent and legends, it includes most of our typical details,since a Cempasuchil flower to Alebrijes everywhere, the sensitive partis very touching and even more for us Mexicans that we are deeplyconnected with our family and ancestors. A very familiar movie, I lovedit, and Im pretty sure you will enjoy it as well. I said Almost perfectbecause ... whats with the DJ on the party??? I still don't get it. Butthat's the only thing ...
