The Day of the Dead is the traditional celebration in which Mexicanshonor the deceased and is of Mesoamerican origin. There is an infinityof international projects that have tried to portray the Mexicanculture, but in one way or another have failed miserably (some morethan others), getting to see some in which we are represented even in aridiculous and offensive . I must confess my fear that "Coco" would bepart of this list, so I initially rejected the idea of ??wasting moneyon the ticket; but once the fear has been overcome, I have beensurprised to see that from the intro of Disney, to the credits, theMexican culture is present. I do not know if by the controversy inwhich he was involved or by the collaboration of Lalo Alcaraz, but themagnificent work to which Pixar has accustomed us, was pleasantlysurpassed, portraying in great detail not only the mysticism thatsurrounds the festivity, but also other elements that are truly part ofour culture (family coexistence, music, costumes, beliefs, characters,etc.). The story of a Mexican boy named Miguel who wants to be like hismusical idol (Ernesto de la Cruz) even against his family, takes him tomeet Hector, who becomes his companion in adventures and with whom bothMiguel and us We recognize many famous people, we discover theimportance of the family and the values ??that identify us as peopleand as a nation. Although in general terms the film is worthy of beingrecommended for the whole family, I must clarify that some situationsand ideas represented are not characteristic of that festival or havebeen incorporated in recent years and that the personality of somefamous people has been significantly altered (I suppose with thepurpose of giving a touch of comedy to the story), which is why I findit painful not to give an absolute 10. Now I understand when theyqualified me with 9.9 and they told me that my work was for a 10 if notfor a tiny detail, but in case the creators of Pixar read this review Iwill compensate them by telling our followers that if they have notgone to see it, Run to your favorite cinema! If they are Mexican theywill be happy to see how they dignify our culture after so manygrievances and if they are not Mexican, but want to know and understandMexico (especially the Day of the Dead tradition) it is the most funway to do it.
