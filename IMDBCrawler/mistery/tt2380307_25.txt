Kinda disappointed with this one. Coco could've been a culturalstatement and a exploration of family values and death itself, butinstead is a rather dull look at a celebration, not a tradition. Theaesthetic qualities are there, as well as the overall depiction ofcurrent Mexican society (sort of), but everything else feels poor incomparison, vane even. The protagonist's journey lacks actual purpose,the writers seem more focused in the real adventure that in themetaphorical one. He doesn't grow or mature. And that is just one ofthe many issues this movie has. At the end, it's just another decenttearjerker children film.
