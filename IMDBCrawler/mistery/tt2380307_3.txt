I may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is allabout in a small Mexican town. Or, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Gobeyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first20 minutes of Wall-E.I got my wish. This is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie aboutwhat family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads nottaken. This is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears,from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding,to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.I can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life anddeath that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and soapproachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layersof meaning and significance for adults.To watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your lifethat are no longer among us.Thank you, Pixar.
