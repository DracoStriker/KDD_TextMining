A Pixar's masterpiece, impeccably done in terms of research (about theMexican culture), animation, script, musicalization, direction andproduction. A subtle yet charming and inspiring story; with a qualityof animation worthy of an Academy Award (I wouldn't be surprised if itwas one of the great winners of 2018); with an extremely powerfulsoundtrack; an excellent script; likable, well-developed and relatablecharacters; and extremely respectful of the cultural component in whichthe story is inspired. In short, one of the best landings of Pixar -perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a "backto basics" in terms of the narrative, history and characterdevelopment, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh andpurposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about.
