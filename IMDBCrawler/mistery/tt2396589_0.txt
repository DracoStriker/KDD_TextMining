If there were ever a film that sums up the phrase 'mixed bag', thenMudbound is surely it. Ranging from emotionally devastating andharrowing drama to downright tedious periods of nothingness, this isone of the most inconsistent films you'll ever see, and although itshighest points prove utterly enthralling and truly memorable, itslowest offer next to nothing in terms of riveting drama. Itsperformances are strong and its directing confident, but that doesn'tescape the fact that this film is just a real mixed bag.Let's start with the film's opening act, which is one of the mostboring and frustrating hours I've spent watching a film. Starting offwith a confusing and poorly executed opening scene, the film reallyfails to pick itself up over the course of its whole first hour, doinglittle more than to establish some of the main characters and thehardships of the muddy, isolated rural community, things that couldhave surely been done just as effectively in a good ten minutes.For the duration of the whole first act, it's pretty difficult to tellwhat the end game of the movie actually is. For one, you've got thestory of a young woman whose marriage allowed her to escape her dullfamily, and who also is deeply frustrated with the muddiness andpoverty-stricken nature of her current life. Then there's somedetailing of the horrific levels of racism in 1940s Mississippi, withthe family's grandfather being the main example for some nasty remarksthroughout. There's also a young black man who goes off to war, who weoccasionally check in with during his battles in Europe, while we alsosee the brother of the central white family flying in the Air Forceduring the war.As you can tell by that very bungled description, the film's first actis an absolute mess. There's very little way to tell what the mainstory is, and what you should really be focusing on for the biggestemotional intrigue, and that, coupled with the fact that it moves at adeathly slow pace, makes it a very frustrating and extremely tediousfirst hour.However, things really do pick up come the second act. Upon seeing thetwo men return to Mississippi from the war, the film's central focusfinally comes to the forefront, and we immediately get a very tenseexchange between the racist grandfather and the African-American warveteran. That's undoubtedly one of the film's highest points, and setsup the atmosphere of deep racial tensions well, finally giving the filmat least a continuing and consistent tension under the surface,something that was completely absent from its first act.The second act then goes into looking at how different generationsrespond to the institutionalised racism, while also shedding light onhow horrifically unjust some of the hardships suffered by so manyhard-working African-Americans were at the time, which proves for aninteresting, albeit never quite powerful watch. The film's middleportion is a great insight into the time period, and holds yourattention throughout, but it never quite manages to hit you hard enoughas a film telling such a story should do.And then comes the film's final act, which is exceptional. For thefinal thirty minutes or so, the devastating reality of racism in thepast is brought brutally into focus, and it makes for a deeplydisturbing and uncomfortable but powerfully moving watch. With thefilm's tension at its height, it doesn't hold back in displaying sometruly horrifying scenes, some of which are easily the most intense andpowerful I have ever seen in a film dealing with the topic.The final act is directed brilliantly, being frank and brutallyrealistic in its depiction of injustice, and moving along at a slow buttense pace to emphasise some truly horrible acts, all the whilemaintaining a strong dignity that allows the deeper, emotional side ofthe sequences to shine through too, all of which makes it simplyastonishing to see.It's fair to say then, given the huge range of comments I have for thisfilm, ranging from total boredom to transfixing and hard-hittingemotion, that Mudbound is a very inconsistent mixed bag, however thereis one element to it that works well from start to finish: theperformances.The wide range of characters in the first act does make its storysomewhat muddled, but each of the actors really shines in bringingtheir own character to life. Carey Mulligan is very strong andconvincing as a young mother frustrated with her life in poverty,Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell are both charismatic young men,meaning that their relationship really shines when it's on display,while Jonathan Banks is excellent as the terrifyingly racist old man,bringing a powerful tension into the film every time he walks into aroom.Overall, then, it's pretty clear that Mudbound isn't a resoundinglysuccessful movie. At times an interesting insight into racism andinjustice in the Deep South in the 40s, at others a tedious slog ofrandomly muddled drama and characters, and at others an astonishinglypowerful, hard-hitting and truly memorable (dare I say it, even Oscar-worthy) drama, it's a very inconsistent and overall frustrating film.However, with its strong performances all the way through andexceptional drama at points, it is a memorable watch.
