I WikiFLix Sneakpeaked this one. The acting is superb. TheCinematography is crisp, gritty and very believable. It is refreshingto have a movie entertain you WITHOUT over the top action & coffee shopcontrived dialogue. The story line unfolds in a way that keeps youcaptivated with nostalgia and wonder of what will happen next. Thiswill definitely be nominated for an Oscar. It could be the first BestPicture win for Netflix! Garrett Hedlund & Dee Rees will have a greatchance of winning awards as well. I would like to go into furtherdetail about the movie but will refrain from spoiling anything. All Ican say is that this 20th Century drama captures the normal events inthe Deep South to perfection. You are going to want to have food &drink near you couch to avoid having to hit the pause button...
