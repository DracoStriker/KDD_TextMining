Mudbound stands as tall as it can, on its conviction and the quality ofthe performances, but its feet are sinking into the ground under theweight of too many clichés. The material is too familiar; kindnessoverwhelming racial tension, disgruntling aftermath of war and familyfeuding tied to a fallen American dream. It is heavily saturated inthemes that are as rich as they are unoriginal, and the script iscomprised of recycled lines like "At least I looked 'em in the eye whenI killed 'em" and "You're not a big war hero, you're a drunk."But the movie still gets by. It's a smoothly interwoven soap operaabout two families the McAllens (white) and the Jackson's (Black)living on the same piece of Mississippi farmland, both with a son whohas gone (and come back from) the war. The sons become friends.Together they wallow in self pity, but deep down they have a yearningto be back there, where they feel they belong, where they are seen asheroes, and where colour matters not.The early scenes in the movie are cut fairly short to accommodate theexposition of an ensemble cast As a result, the opening act feels a bitrushed, but it succeeds in setting up a realized and sympatheticenvironment. In so far as the movie has any breakthroughs, it showcases rising starGarrett Hedlund in best acting to date. He sports a Glarke Gablemoustache that is so sexy its almost distracting in a film whereeveryone is covered in dirt. but the mud is the real star of the movie.It brings a reality to an otherwise dreamy landscape of warm sunsetsand endless fields of green.
