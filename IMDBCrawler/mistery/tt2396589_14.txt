Just watched Mudbound last night and I have to say it is a really goodmovie if you enjoy character development before plot development. Inaddition, it's always a good idea if directors take the time to dumbmovies down for our UK viewers (see above) but us real movie watchershave to suffer. The director here does this masterfully, butunfortunately our UK watcher missed the point of this gem, so pleaseignore that ridiculous review.During the movie I found myself on IMDb, looking up the characters andhad plenty of "where have I seen this person before?" moments. The movie is a slow burn...just like Mississippi...nobody in a hurry todo anything, anywhere, anytime. Movies with character actors in the lead are always, always going togive you more bang for their buck, because they act their butts off! Rural Mississippi surely is a place I won't be visiting soon. It lookslike time stopped down there. Could it be this movie was filmed this year? The way we treat(ed)people of color is truly horrifying. Watch Mr. Banks for an unreal performance as the racist father. Thumbsup to Mudbound.
