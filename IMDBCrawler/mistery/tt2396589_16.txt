Ronsel quick-drying mud stain: it does exactly what it says on the tin? attempts to create a weighty, socially-conscious art movie fromHillary Jordan's plotty, slightly trashy but well-meaning page- turner.Dee Rees's film spends more time in battle, fleshes out the Ronsel-Jamie relationship, and dwells on the minutiae of African-American lifein the Deep South, but in a choppily uninvolving way, and at theexpense of Laura's intriguing story of love, repression, sexual andracial guilt.Critically, it never summons the book's sense of inexorable, fatalisticdread, nor knows what to do as it reaches its climax, which is firstsilly, then rushed and finally pointlessly and unconvincinglyrose-tinted.Mudbound has a few painterly images, good performances from JasonMitchell and Carey Mulligan (who has one fantastic scene largelydisconnected from the narrative and the worst pregnancy prop indecades) and an unvarnished understanding of the unglamorous,subservient pragmatism needed to survive as a black man in '40sMississippi, but it isn't very compelling or convincing.I say this as a middle-class white bloke, but... what promised to be atimely exploration of the African-American experience from an urgentand valuable contemporary voice is instead just a standard bookadaptation: a mediocre melodrama that deals with big themes in ahandsome but hackneyed way. Plus lots of Mary J. Blige staring out ofwindows.
