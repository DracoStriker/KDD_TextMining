This celluloid masterpiece sums up Ch 1 'Reconstructing Reconstruction'of Carol Anderson's "White Rage", SPECTACULARLY! "White Rage ? TheUnspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide" "...the trigger for white rage,invariably, is black advancement. It is not the mere presence of blackpeople that is the problem; rather it is blackness with ambition, withdrive, with purpose, with aspirations and with demands for full andequal citizenship. It is blackness that refuses to accept subjugation,to give up."
