The story follows two men who return home from WWII to Mississippi andeach has a difficult time adjusting to post-war life and dealing withthe racism that is unavoidable in their hometown. Garrett Hedlund andJason Mitchell are the two war vets, and the cast is rounded out byJason Clarke, Mary J. Blige and Carey Mulligan. The direction isconfident from young African-American woman named Dee Rees. The filmwas also shot and edited by women, Rachel Morrison and Mako Kamitsurarespectively. The story is strong, base on a book by Hillary Jordan,and the film looks gorgeous. The performances are all strong and Iexpect this film will be a contender at next year's Oscars. Highlyrecommended.
