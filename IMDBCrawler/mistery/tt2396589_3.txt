This is by far one of the best movies i've seen this year, and in myopinion will stand to be one of the best period pieces ever created. Two different families living in the same environment, but in differentworlds at the same time. The performances were real and grounded, whichcreated some memorable moments on camera. This film doesn't a very goodjob of displaying the natural love one human can have for another,regardless of their racial background, that racism is a learned trait.The films also highlights the lasting effects of war (PTSD,...).Outstanding film!
