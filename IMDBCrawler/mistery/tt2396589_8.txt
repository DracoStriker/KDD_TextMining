Gave it a 6 because it's very unfocused. I wonder if it's the fault ofthe screenplay or is the original book is that way too. It felt likebig pieces were missing from the story or rather not needed there. Bythe end of the movie you realize that Carey Malligan's character wasn'treally crucial to the main racism theme and two main charactersinvolved in it, so it makes you wonder why the first part of the filmactually focuses on her so much. It will be funny is she's nominatedfor this absolutely unnecessary role. I was more interested to find outmore about 2 main characters, but because of the lack of the focus theyboth came up as cliché as well.
