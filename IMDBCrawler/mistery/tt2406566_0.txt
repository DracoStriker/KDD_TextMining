I am visiting Lebanon this summer and surprisingly was shocked to seemore than 10 minutes of Lesbian sex were heavily censored in a countryregarded as one of the most civilized countries in the Arab world andwhere people are open-minded!!!. Even The Lesbian Kiss BetweenCharlieze Theron And Sofia Boutella was censored from the movie inLebanon,even in all Arabian countries this is happening!!!. Despite thefact it is rated 16+ in Lebanon, the Lebanese General Security censorsLesbianism & gay adult scenes!!!. Lorraine Broughton is a sexy and smart spy in MI6, an agent who isalways ready to use all of her lethal skills to stay alive during animpossible mission. With the Berlin Wall about to fall, she travelsinto the heart of the city to retrieve a priceless dossier and takedown a ruthless espionage ring. Once there, she teams up with anembedded station chief to navigate her way through the deadliest gameof spies.Catchy Disco Music,except for the noisy hard rock song.Cleveracting,great action and amazing direction.Do Not See This Movie In Any Arab Country (Including Lebanon) wherecensorship is heavy!.
