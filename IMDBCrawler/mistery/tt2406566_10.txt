There is no story, no characters and not much action. I like the fightscenes, but they are only 2-3 minutes. I guess this is what theaudience wants, people posing with a gun in 1 hand and a cigarettebetween their bruised lips. Also a bit of lesbian action and somecasual ice baths for the hardened super agent. If you want to see agood film on DDR, i suggest "Das Leben der Anderen" , which is*****infinitely****** better than this stylish garbage heap ofjunk-food-film. And if you like spies and agents, i guess "TinkerTailor Soldier Spy"from 2011, or any old classic will be better, like:"The Day of the Jackal", "The Forth protocol" or even any BOnd orBourne film, for that matter. The point is: This film, "Atomic Blonde",is crap. CRAP ! Why Charlize, WHY ? Fire your agent !
