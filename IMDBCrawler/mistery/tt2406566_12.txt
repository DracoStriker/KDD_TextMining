From the first scene of the movie it is clear that this will be moreabout Charlize Theron being hot that it will be about a female ledaction movie. She is in a tub naked icing herself down. She is slightlybattered and slightly bruised. Nothing that would indicate seriousinjury or more important make her less attractive. I have no doubt theexecutives told Charlize that she could be the lead of an action movie,but she would have to be naked throughout the movie. The script itselfis dull and unoriginal. The movie is stylish and Charlize is nakedoften, has naked lesbian sex scenes and she wears thigh high boots andgarter belts in the fight scenes. It is more porn than plot. Ratherthan show a woman using intelligence or creativity to fight men, itrather implausibly has you believe that a woman would have the samestrength as a man. It is almost comical to see this slight woman take apunch from a man or knockout a guy or have the strength to choke a guyor throw him. The fight scenes have a lot of Charlize grunting andsickening violence to make you forget how unrealistic it would be evenfor a male action movie. The film is meant to be more porn than "girlpower" including the scene where a woman is strangled to death on a bedin lingerie. If this is what female led action movies are going to belike, I hope they fail.
