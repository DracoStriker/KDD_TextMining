It seems like Charlize Theron, a two time Oscar nominee and one timewinner, has given up on "quality movies" and capitulated to actionmovies and big bucks. Her action scenes in this movie look absolutelysilly, unconvincing, and just plain stupid. They cheapen the moviewhich is promoted as a mystery thriller about the Berlin Wall. Well,don't watch this expecting to see "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold."I turned it off half way through.
