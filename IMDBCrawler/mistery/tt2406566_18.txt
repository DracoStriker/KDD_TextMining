This movie has one of the best movie soundtracks, one which closelymatches with the theme, look, feel and style of the movie! The movie seems/feels good and stylish. It is filmed in adifferent/novel style. I would like to warn prospective viewers that itis based on a comic book, so some may not like the style and feel ofthe movie.The fight scenes in the movie were awesome in my view, and that is notin some childish sense, I am talking about here, but that the fightfelt very real and it's depiction honest, without any kind of over thetop, populist sequences!All in all you might like this movie on the surface(it's look andambiance), but if you think about it, it fails to make sense. Not thatit's totally absurd, but there are some serious plot holes/questionswhich remain. Add to that, plot seems much convoluted/confusing. Notthat I hate to apply my brain; I love it, but when some importantthings(plot wise) don't make sense, it's a negative overall.
