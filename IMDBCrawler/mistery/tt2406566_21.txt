An ultraviolent action-packed thriller that doesn't give a second tobreathe. Charlize Theron is brilliant in both acting and actionsequences. James McAvoy plays a character who is almost as crazy as hisroles in Filth and Split with perfection. All those symmetric shots andwell shot long action scenes along with the killer 80's soundtrackmakes this an almost perfect action movie. The twist is somewhat givenaway at the beginning itself with over exposition for deception. Itdeserves to come out of the shadow of John Wick 2.
