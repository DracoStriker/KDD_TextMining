I wanted this to be good. But it's not. Charlize is so full of herselfand her training that every frame looks like a sad pose. Because shewants you to think she is so cool. There is a MASSIVE differencebetween acting cool and being cool. This 'aint it. And honestly...ifyou want to be a spy, stop standing out like a supermodel.So is this movie suppose to be...campy? Fun? There are zero stakes,except to make you think she's cool. Have I said this enough? BecauseTHIS is exactly what makes this movie annoying. But idiots will enjoyit because they are overwhelmed with the nostalgic remixes of 80'stunes. Formula for stupid director and dumb heroine...blast memoryinducing music to feats of inhuman strength. Charlize Theron isn't atough person. In fact...in all truth...James McAvoy would brain her bybreathing on her. So why do these movie makers wants us to believeshe's that capable. It's insulting. And dumb. "Wonder Woman" at leasthad the power of Gods to explain this. This was an incredibly dumbmovie, where dumb women who believe this is a liberation of women aregoing to find out the hard way what it means to step up to men who willhurt you in real life. Irresponsible and dumb. Let's leave it at that.
