This movie looked really good in the trailers, I'm sure it looked goodon paper..Charlize Theron's own SALT..why not. If Angelina could pullit off then I've no doubt Charlize could. James Mcavoy who is one of myfavorites was also a strong seller.Hey, the movie LOOKED great, but just like a Trump twitter post..thevisuals were meant to distract you from the truth. There is no moviehere. I walked out of the theater at first trying to convince myself Iliked it..bc there were things in this movie that I like outside of it.Again, Charlize, James and also vets from the John Wick movies. Butthis is bad...How bad? Well I legit didn't care about a singlecharacter in the entire film. SPOILER ALERT: when charlize has one ofher final fights against 3 KGB agents...I truly did not know who toroot for. I didn't give a single damn about Charlize's character..if anything,she was annoyingly robotic. I'd tell you the plot sucked..if there wasone. I personally hate 80's music so that didn't help. Morons will loveit..it looked cool, a couple hot chicks hookin up blah blah blah.Sorry Charlize..I know you developed this for yourself BUT...John Wickthis is not!
