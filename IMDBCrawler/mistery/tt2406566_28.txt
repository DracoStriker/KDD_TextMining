There are good spy movies and there are bad spy movies. A good spymovie is credible and you can immerse in the plot. A bad spy movie istoo cryptic or overstretched, like this one. Although I liked the paceand the flow of the action, I felt let down by the lack of characterdefinition. At the end of the show, you are left empty, with littleclue of what each character was made of in terms of personal profile ormotivation. A typical movie that you watch today and forget everythingabout it the day after.
