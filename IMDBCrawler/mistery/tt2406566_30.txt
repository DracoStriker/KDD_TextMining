A lot of cool cinematography here with unique shades and hues toreflect different scenes to really make them pop along with some great80s music. It's nice to see a decent female spy lead her own espionageflick, like "Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation's Rebecca Ferguson butwith more screen time. John Wick co-director David Leitch's boldly overthe top "Atomic Blonde" is stuffed on plotting and heavy with neon litvisuals, but it will satisfy your craving for woman powered heroism. There is no Bond humor here the film draws parallels to AngelinaJolie's "Salt". While "Atomic Blonde's story is more "Tinker TailorSoldier Spy" than actually "Salt" Allow the icy, unbeatable CharlizeTheron and her "Fury Road" certified action chops to escort you througha maze of devious Cold War intrigues in a movie filled with high wirefights and high end fashion. John Goodman plays the CIA spook, JamesMcAvoy and Sofia Boutella are involved in a love triangle withCharlize. All parties are after the Magoffin in this case a list. Ihighly recommend this on VidAngel it's a very hard R film.
