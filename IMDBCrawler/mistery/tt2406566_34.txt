Seriously, that's how bad this movie was. Make a bet with some friendsas to which corny 80's songs will be heard in the movie. You have agood chance of getting quite a few. If you're a big fan of corny 80'ssongs on the radio or 80's night at the bar, you'll love this film.Worse yet, they don't even match the soundtrack appropriately to whatis happening in the movie.Charlize Theron is a good actress, but man, she whiffed in this. Hercharacter is an insufferably boring, pompous Brit who has nopersonality. Sofia Boutella, this could be a career ender for her. JohnGoodman is just phoning it in. James McAvoy does his best to save thewhole thing, but the entire project is a big fat mess.The twist at the end is bad, so confusing, so out of left field, thatit's not worth even worrying about. We will never see a sequel to thisfilm. Guaranteed.My one compliment is for the fight scenes. They were pretty good, butwasted in a garbage film like this.
