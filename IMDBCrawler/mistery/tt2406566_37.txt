I found this movie massively disappointing. It was completely overhyped as the new "female bond"?. Nothing of the sort at all! The storywas completely disjointed. Was really an overrated action movie thathad a great sound track (probably better than the movie itself)? Andspeaking of the music, it was way too loud through the movie, whichmade it more of a distraction.
