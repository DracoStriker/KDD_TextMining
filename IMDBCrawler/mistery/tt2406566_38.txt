Atomic Blonde is an action movie set during the Cold War. The moviestars Charlize Theron as a spy in East Berlin to retrieve an informant.The mission takes an unfortunate turn and action ensues.Atomic Blonde has excellent action scenes and acting from an ensemblestar cast. Actors and actresses such as Sofia Boutella, John Goodman,and James McAvoy do a great job here. The action is well directed withminimal CGI and stuntwork that looks real. These are factors that areworth the price of admission, but the movie has problems.Atomic Blonde suffers from a difficult to understand plot withcharacter motivations that do not appear to make sense. The villainsare only there to be obstacles for the protagonist to overcome insteadof characters with a conflicting motivation. This movie has somestrange pacing with scenes that should setup motivations either beingtoo short or not well understood.I would recommend Atomic Blonde to anyone looking for an entertainingaction movie and nothing more.
