Atomic Blonde is one of the coolest movies of the year. This movie wasaction packed the whole way through. If you are wanting a rush in themovies this is the movie for you to see this summer. The movie was notthe only good thing about the movie the acting was on point, the actionwas great, and the soundtrack was totally 80s. Thus was definitely amind blowing action film.Parents this film has a bunch of sex scenes involving woman and womenso I don't think this is a family film at all. This movie also has someof the best action scenes I have ever seen in a movie this movie wasjust non stop action packed fun. John Goodman was Fantastic in this,but he is good in everything he is in. If you like my review of AtomicBlonde and if it was helpful then go enjoy the movie.My score 10/10
