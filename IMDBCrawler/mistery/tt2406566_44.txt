As stated in other reviews this film seems to have a high, (very high!)rating for what is an ordinary film.Whilst the film is very stylish and put together well with a crackingsound track is this enough to lift it to more than seven points?Probably not, whats with the Lesa scenes?I'm not a pre-pubescent schoolboy after all!Miss Theron may be lovely to look at but acting isn't really her strongsuit and she needs to do a bit more work if she is to speak with a poshlimey accent!This said Atomic Blond is a great little to no plot roll-a-coaster of acomic book come to live action movie.Go and see it, James Bond it is not.
