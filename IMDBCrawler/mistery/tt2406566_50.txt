Does anyone really believe that a woman with thin arms can knock outone man after another? If you do, Atomic Blonde is probably for you.Charlize Theron has thin arms that are more at home lifting a tea-potthan knocking out men who are three times as heavy as she is.Suspending dis-belief is what Hollywood wants you to do but this ismuch more than that - it's believing the unbelievable.Why was the lesbian scene inserted, by the way? If the main characterwas a male, I doubt he would have been shown making out with a guy.Maybe this is another case of the sleazy straight guy fantasy marketedas "feminism" or "girl power". It's neither.
