I tried sitting through Atomic Blonde, but I didn't make it to the end.Atomic Blonde tries to be an action\mystery\thriller\whatever with afemale lead and a retro new wave soundtrack. I was immediately remindedof the film Baby Driver and I caught myself asking again 'Is this amovie or a music video?'.Anyway, the plot of Atomic Blonde: 'An undercover MI6 agent is sent toBerlin during the Cold War to investigate the murder of a fellow agentand recover a missing list of double agents.' -wait....did this justdescribe the James Bond movie Skyfall: 'MI6 agents James Bond and EveMoneypenny pursue mercenary Patrice, who has stolen a hard drivecontaining details of undercover agents.; I roll my eyes as Ianticipate another of Hollywood's dregs.Unrealistic wardrobe changes, unrealistic fight scenes, multiplecoincidental plot points that gives a new definition to the wordconvenience.Atomic Blonde is the result of reheating in the microwave the leftoversof all the other action\mystery\thriller\whatever films of the lastdecade.
