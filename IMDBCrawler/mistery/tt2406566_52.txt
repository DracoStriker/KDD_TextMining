I think this movie was made by the tobacco industry. Stoli Vodka andJack Daniels probably kicked in some money too. There is some seriousproduct placement here.. I've never seen more smoking in a movie in mylife. Otherwise this movie is just a modern Hollywood "formula" movie.110 pound baddass female super-spy takes out 100 heavily armed men andsaves the day. Oh yeah, and throw in a gratuitous lesbian scene andsome shots of Charlize's nipples and you got a movie!The bright spot in the movie was the car chase scene. Very cool IMO soI raised my rating from a 2 to a 4.The characters were underdeveloped, boring and cliché. If you want tosee a better baddass girl movie, I would recommend Wonder Woman.
