Rating: 2 for the first half, 8 for the second halfI was puzzled by other reviews of this film. The reason severalreviewers gave for their extremely positive or extremely negativeratings was the alleged feminism, lesbianism, and misandry. Some films have indeed hit moviegoers over the head with PoliticallyCorrect SJW messages, making them every bit as unwatchable as thetypical heavy-handed "Christian film". For me, "Atomic Blonde" did notfall into that category. For me, the deal-breaker was the "my eyes glaze over" pace of the firsthalf of the film. I almost gave up on watching the film to the end.Fortunately I persisted, and was rewarded with an above average, kick-ass second half.I suspect the flashback structure of the film had something to do withit. One too many flashbacks killed any vestige of forward momentum. The slightly lower rated 2010 spy thriller "Salt", which had a verysimilar plot/theme, was actually a better film from a story-tellingcraft perspective. It moved along nicely from beginning to end. I wanted to like this film. Charlize Theron is one of my favoriteactresses. Angelina Jolie is not. But "Salt" was actually the betterfilm.
