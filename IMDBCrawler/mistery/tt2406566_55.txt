I had high expectations of this movie. Maybe that is why I am somehowdisappointed of it. John Wick 2 for me is a masterpiece and a moviethat will be remembered for a long time. My mistake that is I thoughtAtomic Blonde will be kind of the same. But it wasn't. It's not a badmovie at all. In fact, it has a decent story and some good actionparts. And I really like Charlize Theron, it is perfect for her role(though I liked her a lot more in Mad Max). The problem is that thewhole espionage story doesn't get too serious. Maybe that is the point,but for me it tried to be a modern espionage movie that just doesn'tknow what wants to be at times. And the action moments were way toofew, it's not much difference from what I saw in the trailer. So yes,maybe it's just me, but I'm disappointed of it and very sad because ofthat.
