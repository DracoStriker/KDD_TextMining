This espionage thriller is adapted from a graphic novel called "TheColdest City" and is the directorial debut of David Leitch, formerly astunt coordinator and second unit director in work such as "John Wick"(and it certainly shows). The eponymous MI6 agent is LorraineBroughton, played with panache by the tall, once South African oncemodel who rather stole the show in "Mad Max: Fury Road". Set in Berlinas the wall is about to fall in 1989, like the recent "Baby Driver" wehave a loud soundtrack of contemporary music.If all this suggests more style than substance, that would be a fairinference. The convoluted plot - set out in a series of flashbacks -revolves, as so often in spy movies (think "Mission: Impossible"), inthe hunt for a list of agents but, again as so frequently is the case,the object of the search is really irrelevant (what cinema critics calla MacGuffin). But, if the substance of the movie is thin, the style isterrific with flashy camera-work and tons of gritty action, involvingnot just guns and cars but any domestic object that comes to hand, justas long as it can be smashed into someone's face. A ten-minute fightscene on a set of stairs is set to become something of a classic.This is not a film that would stand up to any serious feministcritique, but it's an all-too-rare guilty pleasure to see a confidentand capable woman kicking male ass. There has been too little of itsince "The Long Kiss Goodnight" (1996), although this summer (2017)we've had the delights of "The Ghost In The Shell" and "Wonder Women".If the Blonde were to become a franchise like Bond or Bourne, I for onewould not complain.
