I haven't wrote the review for ages but this film was so inspirited Icould't resist. I don't understand IQ of people targeted with the worstexpression of feminism, and only place where "Deep State US" will everwin against Russians and The People of USA, in Hollywood movie. I hadto respond because watching of this kind of movies is like info watchwhats going on in the world stage. Who has little brains to readbetween the lines got it all very well. Also it is sad to see thatcrisis is to big at the moment in US film industry that some knownactors sell reputation for chips. Anyhow crisis is always good to tellwho is who.
