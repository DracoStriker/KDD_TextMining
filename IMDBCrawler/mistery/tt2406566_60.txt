The only thing this movie has going for it was marketing and casting.The story is not compelling. The cinematography is annoying. The movieis sometimes almost black and white other times it has color.Everything is a stereotype in the movie. You never care about anycharacter. There is a fight scene every few minutes where the smallfemale has to beat up many thugs. The film never shows why any emotionis called for. The lesbian scene dose not add to the story. Lastlypacing is terribly and the dialogue is unbelievable.
