What really is there to say about this. No wonder Hollywood issuffering. These young pukes on their way up in Hollywood have no ideahow to make a good spy film.First, real spies don't go jumping from bed to bed all the time.(Unless they are East Germans). Real spies don't run around 'hunting'for information. Anyone who has to adapt their techniques is at greaterrisk of being caught, because one slip-up and you are dead. Real spiesstick to one area of expertise, and Western spies especially didn'tusually leave a trail of bodies like their KGB counterparts did. Themethodologies between East and West were entirely different.For a real spy film (not totally, but a bit better at least), see TheFourth Protocol, with Pierce Brosnan and Michael Caine. That is muchcloser to how real spies operate.There isn't usually such a thing as a double-cross in real life.Needless to say, there IS a traitor in this film, and it is obvious whoit is if you know who the actor is (ahem.....) Another good spy film: The Good Shepherd. Although it received poorreviews, much better.There are numerous nude shots of Charlize Theron but are usually toobrief to be gratuitous. Why the title is called Atomic Blonde, I don'tknow, as there's nothing about nuclear weapons of the sort discussed inthe film. Another dumb one for this summer bummer.
