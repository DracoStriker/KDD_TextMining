Atomic Blonde is a surprise. The story has been told quite a few timesbut what makes this movie watchable is charlize theron. Watchable? Imeant SUPERB. She is amazing in this movie. The action scenes broughtthe movie to life from the dull story it tries to bring. In fact, allthe actors are great and the only complaint is the directing. It couldcould have been shot more fast paced. But the movie does correct thisthrough the second half, so that makes it worthwhile. I didn't expectany twists in this story but towards the end, BOY, nailed it. In theend Atomic Blonde is charlize theron's movie whose kicks and punchesare too prized to be missed. So bring the popcorn and get an AtomicBlonded experience.
