I didn't really have any expectations for this film, I knew the kind ofstyle the film was going for by watching the trailers and seeing itadvertised, and I thought that it could be a decent film.However, I was wrong. This was one of the most laughable, cringeworthy, and boring films I have seen this year. Im not exaggerating. Iliterally tried to fall asleep in the cinema because I was so bored.The film barely gripped me. At the beginning I was intrigued, howeverafter twenty to thirty minutes there was no hope.The film relies heavily on aesthetic than plot. Maybe if they focusedmore on plot, it wouldn't have felt so messy in the middle. The musicwas great, but after a while it became tedious, as every scene had an80's hit playing over the top. The style of the film, in terms of thelighting and the shots, was interesting at the start. But, it soon feltvery 'done before' and unoriginal. There was just nothing excitingabout it. Lastly, the acting was alright, there were great actors inthe film. I just can't get over the cringe that James Macavoy broughtto the film. 'I f*cking love Berlin!'...Really? I winced when he saidthat, probably a part of the writers problem to be fair.Overall, I can understand why this could be enjoyable for comic/actionmovie goers. However, the way the film was orchestrated was not for me.I would not recommend it.
