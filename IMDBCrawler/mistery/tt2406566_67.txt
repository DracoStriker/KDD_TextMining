When are we going to stop piling out this tired old tat. I'd read a fewgood things about this one and hoped it might be a cut above the usualnonsensical shoot em up beat em ups. But my hopes were soon dashed andmy mind was wondering within ten minutes. And the music was soincongruous and I like most of the tracks - just not here. So bored,bored, bored, but it no doubt kept the easily please juveniles in ageand brain capacity happy. I just wish Hollywood would wake up beforeits looking at it's the future in the rear view mirror on the way tothe knackers yard.
