Movie looks great at first.. She can kick ass. But after a while,that's all there is.. Music soundtrack is good.. They completely overdothe scattered video editing. After a while you become numb, cause youcan't really keep track of what is going on.On the surface, the movie has everything going for it.. But in reality,it is a hot mess. But if you enjoy watching a hot blonde beat the crap out of men..you'll like it.
