This movie is not only a collage in its soundtrack but also in the waythe camera moves, how the scenes are edited and finally a choppingblock full of lumps of which only a few contain good acting. I neverlived in the eighties and obviously this movie is directed to thosepeople by the choice of scenery, everything about this movie screamsCliché Cliché CLICHEEEEEE!!The only thing I found interesting was the last fighting scene inBerlin which I'd seen before in a video essay on how to effectivelyedit action. The second star I give for the effort the director andactors put into this movie. I was very excited to watch this movie,hoping it would be something more than another Bourne ripoff andperhaps something more inspired like Old Boy and The Raid. What cameout of it was not only a Bourne ripoff but also just a bland story thatis put into scene by a director that simply doesn't know what kind offilm he wants to make. The diversity in how the action is captureddoesn't feel as focused as it could be, starting off with very choppyediting and ending in longer takes that actually draw you into theintensity of the moment. Then we didn't even talk about the backdrops,the unnecessary lesbian love scenes which were just obvious (andseemingly effective) fan service. This movie isn't worth your time ifyou know what defines good action movies.
