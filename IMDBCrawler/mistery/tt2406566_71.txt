There is not much to say about the new trend (relatively new) in media.And that is the simple narrative that violence towards men isacceptable, even laudable because it's seen through the context ofreactionary feminism. There will be thousands of screaming thunderingfeminists claiming that looking at a woman with lust is the same asrape; having a contrary or critical attitude towards questionablebehavior by women, and even how men are being portrayed, targeted andruined in the name of the advancement of 'feminism'. Since Feminism hasmostly attained its target (save for equal pay), then to maintain itsferocity, relevance and focus, group-think dictates a new enemy must beshaped. Without a villain, an ideology withers and ceases to becomecharged. So this film is just another step towards mindless vengeancetowards men. Women want not only to be equal but to do as they please.Not all women, but the fanatical, organized, angry few who are floodingthe airwaves are maintaining that men are a ubiquitous threat, and Ipity the young men who are going to grow up in a society that not onlyhates you because you're a man but will punish you for it. May not havemuch to do with the film, but it all depends on what you see right?
