Disappointing... The excessive violence and lesbian sex wereexaggerated and has no relationship to the plot of the movie; that's ifthere is a plot to start with. Started the movie with a speech fromReagan? Not even needed for the movie. Very poor quality. I wasted morethan 30 minutes of my time waiting for the movie to evolve, but it wasgoing from bad to worse. Finally, we could not take it anymore andleft. Waste of money and time!
