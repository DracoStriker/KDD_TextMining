I can watch 1980s music videos without going to a movie theater.Charlize Theron was made up to look like Debra Harry's twin, but forall the music from that era that was included in the film not oneBlondie single & the film was filmed in the style of a moody 1980smusic video, think Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, & The Clash. At first Ithought wow nice cinematic tribute to the 1980s music scene, but afteran hour of grueling chase and fight scenes, a weak story line that justdroned on and on & an obviously gratuitous lesbian sex scene I justwanted this stinker to end but there was still another hour left! It'sgoing to be at least a couple of months before I can go sit in a movietheater again, shame on this film for using a very good actress & somekiller vintage music to make this horrendous stink bomb.
