If you want to waste your time watching this movie, this is exactlywhat you need. This movie was very boring, you can't wait to end, thescenes were predictable, unrealistic though. I may say that the actorsplayed the roles well, but this doesn't change the fact that it's awaste of time with this movie. If you don't have what to do and want towatch this movie, don't, open and read a book instead!
