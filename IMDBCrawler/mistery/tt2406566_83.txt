Its been my impression over the last few years that film industry inthe West, especially the US, has forgotten how to produce well madefilms. Atomic Blonde is, I believe, yet another in a long line of films thatis indicative of that decline. Uninspired narrative, a tiresomepredictable story line, mediocre performances and gratuitously violentaction scenes, really leave very little to be desired. To my mind this a low rent, Sin City style "sort of", spy thriller,that's not that thrilling or even enjoyable. Three out of ten from me.
