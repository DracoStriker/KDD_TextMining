it seem to drone on and on... told from the after it happened prose.Theron is always fun to watch, but did not seem to be able to expressher personality in this one. The action sequences are passable. JamesMcavoy seems to get the best lines. The story is far to choppy, with noreal development. This is a home view, maybe even after it hitscable... don't waste your money on this snoozer...
