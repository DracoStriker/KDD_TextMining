Apart from the moment when we see a poster of Stalker (last point inthat we still have some little hopes), and the good fight at the endwhen finally we do not have to heard that crappy and cheesy 80's music(but it is too late); nothing else exist in this empty movie. Maybe oneor two good moments of that music, would have worked well; but all thetime? The lesbian scenes are also, insipid and unnecessary. But theworst is that in the end, the two final twists of the plot fail,because we never really believe anything Charlize Theron does or says.Besides, at this moment we are just expecting that the film ending in anot so obvious way, and soon. But this does not happen. In short, thatmovie is only like a beautifully wrapped gift, without nothing inside,innocuous, and with several rather tedious moments. Not to mention thehistorical inaccuracies (or political agendas). Only another, typicalHollywood film.
