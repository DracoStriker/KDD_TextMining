Bad characters, weak plot, unnecessary nudity, long and drawn out fightsequences, ridiculous sex scenes that bear no relevance to anything.Just another waste of 2 hours! So tired of movies that are offensiveand insulting to your intelligence. Charlize's co star is just anannoying character and all I wanted to do was hit him or simply ignorehim. Just plain uncomfortable to watch!
