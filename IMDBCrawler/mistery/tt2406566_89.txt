From watching the trailers i knew this movie would be a huge pile of dung, the main premise is woman good and intelligent, man evil and dumbi see a lot of sites claiming this to be " best movie 2017" are you kidding?this movie is just another dumb Hollywood blockbuster, with no depth,it is only getting a lot of positive reviews because it is a feminist anti male movie, the soundtrack is annoying and doesn't add much to the moviethis movie has no substance ,the main character is very unlikeable , i wanted someone to run her over, also James mcavoy plays the character he always plays , the weak girly man attempting to act tough i watched this movie with my wife and she agreed so don't call me a sexist pigthe golden age of cinema is long gone, now Hollywood has to force diversity and a far left agenda down everyones throat,when was the last time you saw a black guy as the villain in a movie?
