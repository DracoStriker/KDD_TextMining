It could be argued that Atomic Blonde is style over substance but thepros by far outweigh the cons when looking at the overall picture. Yes the story may be a bit basic/forgettable but we have CharlizeTheron in an outstanding lead role, a stone cold character showing nomercy on anyone who crosses her path. The fight choreography isoutstanding.The supporting cast are all very good. The cinematography is superb,mixing it up with neon lighting as well as some beautifully shot scenesof a Berlin winter. The soundtrack is also top notch. Not exactly groundbreaking stuff in terms of story but forentertainment value it's right up there with the better action films ofrecent times so hopefully there will be more to come for Atomic Blonde.
