I am not sure who had the bright idea of interweaving this story withthe Berlin Wall coming down! IMO it is what made this movie into astinker! There were several good fight scenes and I really appreciatedthe retro music, I just was turned off by the double and triple spies,the Berlin atmosphere, and trying to follow the story! The were tryingto do way too much! On top of everything else, they wanted to show ahomosexual relationship! Why didn't they include political opinionsabout refugees and Merkel while they were at it?? Charlize Theron didher own stunts, however, they must have cut out the good stuff!!
