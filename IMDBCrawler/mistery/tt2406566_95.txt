Atomic Blonde is Charlize's fantasy how she wants to be noticed by thepublic. I cannot say she fails, but neither can I say she succeeds. Sheis a great actress with stunning looks and brains. Her images for Diorperfume are classic and pure class. Charlize is Atomic Blonde, but themovie itself, well, the script is just plain stupid and silly.Basically, each spy is a double agent, there are lots of fight scenesand the movie skips from one encounter to another, and that's it. Inother words, this movie is very empty.
