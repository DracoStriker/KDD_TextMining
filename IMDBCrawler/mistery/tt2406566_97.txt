Before anything else, I will talk about the role of the stunning jawdropping acting of a brilliant actress. She in every scene of themovie, has an incredible intimidating performance.but somehow she makesyou fall in love with her. Another point is the cinematography, it isreally mind blowing thanks to Jonathan Sela he brings the picture of anold movie setting to life. In every scene, you feel the mystery whichmakes you dive and lose yourself in the labyrinth of the great eyes ofthe man behind the camera. The movie itself reminds me of Jack Reacher2012 and John Wick 2014. overall this is one hell of a worth watchingmovie.
