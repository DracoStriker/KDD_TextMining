I saw the trailer of this movie in the cinema but was unable to watchit there so I downloaded it instead. I'm glad I did not pay any moneyfor it as this movie follows the usual spy-pads with lots of twistsespecially at the end. That I did not really mind but the big questionis how Spyglass was able to make up the list of double- agents.... Theother big flaw in this movie were the fighting-scenes. Theron is beinghit on and on but is still able to kill her enemies. Ever seen aboxing-match? One good blow and a well-trained boxer goes down but notCharlize! She really is the true wonder woman in this movie. Also someof the opponents are shot and/or stabbed but are able to keep onfighting. Absolutely overdone and absolutely unbelievable. Also thelesbian scene, which apparently is a wonderful scene for a lot ofpeople, did not contribute to increase the value of reality. My verdictis a 6.5 out of 10 just because of the twists in the story and theaction but the movie lacks reality and humor.
