A cold war can have rising temperatures. When fighting is no longertelevised, it usually runs amuck in the undergrounds. Soldiers trade inuniforms for wires, and ammunition for information. When terrorismhides, spies dance. Loraine waltzes cautiously through a town split byan iron divide. She was sent to extract hard data, but then again maybeshe wanted to come here all along.Loraine has a kiss of death and many suitors. Being a maiden of her ownwill, she protests aggressively and has the skills to resist. Highheels become lethal in her palms, and lipstick doubles as urbancamouflage. She is a student of her environment and commissions themost unlikely weapons.Her partner, David, passes from being reluctant to being obstructive.She acknowledges his handsome operations, but barks at his carefulcomposure. A tedious game of cat and cat ensues, and claw marks ripinto each other's confident facades.Espionage unfolds like a cracking ice sheet on a pond. Very slow allthe way until the critical moment, then all the weak points sojourn tothe barrier's demise. Loraine watches this deterioration, sunk at thebottom of the pond. She is in the information business, and hercompetitors have caught all the gossip. Her battered bones attest tobrutality of discovering intel a moment too late. In this foreign pool of entropy, she entwines herself with Delphine, apoet turned informant. Delphine speaks in prose, but observes instanzas. Rarely enthused, Loraine is tackled by this woman's fearlessignorance. They find themselves wrapped in a mortal coil, aprofessional love with ulterior motives. Even the purest connectionmust be scrutinized when your head contains lethal secrets.Privileged knowledge breeds death. "Top secret" folders are the plaguesof elitism. Chairmen look for red flags, but their agents have paintedtheir entire existence red. Uncertainty is a government's biggest fear,and their employees carry out terrorism in the name of obscurity.
