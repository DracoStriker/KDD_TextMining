I absolutely fell in love with the story of this movie. I went to thepremier last night and didn't really know what to expect. I was verypleasantly surprised. I don't consider myself an emotional moviewatcher but I almost lost it 3 times and I laughed more than I couldremember. The story line was very easy to follow along. I did not loseinterest not one time. I was so impressed with the children actors. Avery beautifully written and directed movie. Must watch for the wholefamily.
