Wonder is the story of Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) a boy born withsevere facial deformities as he goes to school for the first time infifth grade. Middle school is probably the least forgiving environmenthe could be entering, as anyone who has ever met an eleven year oldcould tell you, but he has a strong support network with his parents(Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts) and his sister (Izabela Vidovic). If the story had only focused on Auggie it would have been good, butwhat set it apart was that it branched out. A lot of time is devoted tohis sister, Via, as she is also facing a tough transition in her lifeas she begins high school. She is used to having to take care ofherself because Auggie requires so much attention and she is able toput her own problems on the backburner to be there to support herlittle brother.They also look through the eyes of some of Auggie and Via's friends tosee how Auggie has impacted their lives. This really helps the viewerconnect with the film and really makes it work as a engrossing andheartwarming picture.
