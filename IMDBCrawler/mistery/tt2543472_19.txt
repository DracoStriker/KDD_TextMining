I watched this film with a school group, and while it has a good lessonin it, the lesson feels very forced. The screenwriters seemed to pickout the best quotes from the novel and squeeze as many as them as theycould into the screenplay. A lot of the narration was unnecessary, thefilm tells you what happens instead of showing. The chapter structureseemed unnecessary as well; it was not unusual for a character'schapter to give said character five minutes of screen time at thestart, but forget whose chapter it is halfway through. The lastforty-five minutes of the movie is Miranda's chapter, but she is onlymentioned shortly in the start, barely being developed while the filmexpects us to sympathize with her. The jokes are dumb, and August'scharacter made me wince. There were a lot of clichés in it as well, butthere were some unintentionally funny scenes, such as the scene whereMiranda stares into August's window for five minutes creating ahilariously campy shot. I could also add the hilarious group Minecraftsession to this list as well. However there was some goodcinematography, with nice shots of Coney Island, and Jack blockedbehind a statue of an angel to signify his kindness. Overall, the movieis cliché, annoying, and boring.
