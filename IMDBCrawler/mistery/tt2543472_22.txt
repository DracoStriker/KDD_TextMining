I saw "Wonder" last night, I like Owen Wilson and I wanted to catch thefilm early so that I could rave about it on IMDb.com, but I cannot dothat.The movie is just okay. I got the feeling that it was trying to make asignificant social statement, I just wanted some fun entertainmentinstead. It seems like there are some movie directors in Hollywood thatthink they have something to "say" and they use their movies to getthat message out....but it is just wasted energy, we don't care.Now to the review: Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts are like peanut butterand gasoline....they are completely unbelievable as husband and wife,they don't mix well. Their acting skills kept the movie going butduring the movie I kept thinking there is no way these two would everhookup in real life.And what would a new Hollywood movie be without a white chick and blackguy hooking up? You guessed it, this movie does it's part at socialengineering....liberal style.This movie is not fun, it is a liberal fairy tale with a liberalmessage.I gave the film a 4 because of the wonderful acting by ALL of thechildren. The kids in the film made it worth watching. Kudo's to thekids!
