First of all, I gotta say that I read the book. I absolutely loved thebook. Now, I wasn't going to raise my expectations for the movieadaptation because we all know how movies disappoint in comparison tothe book. Wonder however, stays true to the book, which is its majorredeeming point. I thought it would be some modified, really boringmovie that would make me sigh throughout the whole 2 hours as I pointedout key flaws and differences between the movie and book (because I'mone of those people), but I loved it. The acting was INCREDIBLE, thestory stayed true to the book (they only left out a flew plot pointsrather than invent their own) and it was overall a great experience.When I got out of the cinema, so many people were crying or said theyhad cried and I was overjoyed to find out that I wasn't the only personwho felt touched. The child actors are fantastic, but overall therewasn't one bad actor. IF you were considering seeing this movie butweren't sure because you thought it might be boring, trust me, it'sreally worth the watch!!
