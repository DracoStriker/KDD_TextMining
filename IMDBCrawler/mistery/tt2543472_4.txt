We Need this type of movies nowadays!It is an emotional, funny & uplifting story. I was fully sympathizedwith August Pullman. It was so wonderful to see and feel everythingthrough him. The way he describes everything is so beautiful. Also,knowing the story from the perspective of certain characters made astrong connection between me and them.I read the book. It was awesome too. Some details were changed in themovie but were good changes and there are some details from the book Ihoped the movie to show it and it didn't but that didn't affect themovie in a negative way. Everything was simple, clear and on point. Themovie has strong messages about kindness, love, appreciating everyonefor who they are and true friendship.Jacob Tremblay proves again his talent as an actor. You won't recognizehim because of the makeup but his expressions, voice and eyes werereally persuasive. All the kids are amazing. Izabela Vidovic surprisedme a lot. Julia Roberts is excellent and Owen Wilson was great. He wasexactly as I imagined him while reading the Book.Finally, Stephen Chbosky. Great job man! Once again he made me careabout the characters and he portrayed them beautifully specially thekids. He let them shine in every scene.I loved this movie so much. I had a great and enjoyable time with it. Ilaughed and cried. It is pure and heartwarming. This is a perfectfamily movie.
