I loved this movie! I was expecting this movie to be a child's versionof the classic "Elephant Man" but it was so much more. Delving intodifferent aspects of Auggie's life and developing the characters aroundhim.This was brilliantly done and has a positive message for all ages andall walks of life. I highly recommend it for anyone!
