I just got home from watching Wonder, and I was amazed. The acting wasabsolutely incredible, and felt very believable. As the storyprogressed, the characters became more deep, and human. A few, such asJack Will and Julian, made mistakes, and managed to solve the problemsthat they unintentionally created. There are many different stories andperspectives told, and it really makes the characters shine. There weremany moments where I cried or got emotional, due to the sheer honestyand emotion in this movie.The one complaint I have with this movie is that some characters, suchas Summer and Charlotte, got left out of the narrative. I understand,however, that this is due to movie length. Otherwise, the movie is perfect. I feel that this is the kind of movieeveryone needs to see. It shares many important and relatable messages.This movie is honestly a life changer. 9/10
