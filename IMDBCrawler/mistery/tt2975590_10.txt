The storyline was slow, and the whole movie was built for the 10 yearsold children to understand whats happening. It was filled with clichésand was not creative at all. I was so disappointed after watching this.I watched this with my friends and they are on the same opinion. Theworst Batman / Superman movie ever I think. Ben Affleck was not a goodchoice for Batman because he is not "blue blooded" enough and was notable to act like them.Spoiler alert! Why did they need Wonderwoman? She was reallyunnecessary. (Only for the Hype maybe?!) :/ :/ :/ :/ PS.: Why they didnot ask for David Mazouz to play in the first part?
