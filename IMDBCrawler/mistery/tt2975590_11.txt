After reading all the negatives reviews, I still went to watch (in 3D!)this superhero battle thinking it may not be the critics' film but atleast it would be some spectacular mess offering some guilty superherofun. (Short answer: No. Not fun. Not even spectacular. Just long boringmess!)First things first! There is not much of a "battle" (physical orpsychological) b/w Batman & Superman! They just fight once, and it goesexactly as anyone would have expected! Batman trying somethings - boomboom - which doesn't work and then hint: Kryptonite!It's not even like cinematography or awesome background music is takingthe film forward (like say Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch) to keep yourooted! It just keeps on going taking. Taking itself seriously. Andthen keeps on going even longer!Essentially what happens is a guy does some hocus-pocus and creates amonster and these three super-things kill it. And just so that you knowthis is actually the whole movie for you. There's actually no role ofwonder-woman in this film other than that shown in the trailers.Nothing! She shows up a few times and bam! directly at the final fightwhich was quite lethargically choreographed to say the least. Batman isloosely played by Ben Affleck wearing his famous scowl, but I wouldn'tblame him as there is actually not much for him to do. Script hassnatched away from everyone of any possibility of giving any goodperformances. Lois Lane is always the damsel in distress saved bySuperman! Superman plays superman doing nothing at all. And there'smuch time given to their romance which nobody cares about. And if youhave noticed even I have been writing this long about nothing butranting my frustration because there's, as you guessed right, nothingconcrete to criticize about in this two and a half hour long alarmingamount of pretension on the name of a battle! And at last Superman isdead and all you are left thinking is "I don't give a f*** about it!"
