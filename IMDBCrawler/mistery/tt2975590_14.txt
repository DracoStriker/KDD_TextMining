A Batman who behaves likes a hissy teenage girl taking the fight toSuperman because there's 'a 1% chance he will destroy earth' when hewas shown up to be of not much use when a nuclear warhead was fired orwhen Doomsday was totaling the city; a Batman who was all set to writehis legacy by killing Superman (who doesn't know for a fact if Aquamanand the lot are friend or foe) only to become his friend just like thateven saying cringe worthy lines like 'Martha will not die tonight' andthe even worse 'I will not fail him in death'...A Superman who could hear Alfred talking to Bruce Wayne at the partyfrom miles away but couldn't tell that a bomb was ticking away lessthan 5metres away; a Superman who overdoes the love sick puppy bitstopping just short of tears (to an aging Amy Adams gawd); a Supermanwho gives Batman a face to face warning because that always works withfoes (perceived or not)...A movie that has borrowed from James Bond (from Bruce Wayne's agingbrooding looks that were probably set for 'smouldering' to the redherring L'Americain-White Portugese to 'key' action sequence linkingback to a location from the earlier movie - former MI6 Building v Manof Steel destruction site - to the Aston Martin etc) and Avengers(nuclear warhead, enhanced Iron Man suit, dream sequences - gawd howmany were there!?!) with a Jim Carrey/Riddler-like Lex Luther but in aninfinitely more annoying Jesse Eisenberg...Actually, 2 out of 10 may be too much for making us suffer two and halfhours of a self-important drama but seeing how Warner Bros seems tohave bought sooo many 10/10 reviews here, it's about right.Only Gal Gadot looked like she was having fun albeit her briefappearance and therefore, she should be declared the rightful winner ofBatman v Superman.
