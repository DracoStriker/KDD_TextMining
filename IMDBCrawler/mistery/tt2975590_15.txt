This movie is such a let down, I watched a hour of this horrific peaceof writing and cannot believe that they made such a stupid movie. Thescenes were jumping from junk to more junk that made no sense. Iabsolutely love batman and superman and this movie is just insanely offwhat it should of been like... Good actors playing super popular partsbut no story line what so ever. I was super confused throughout thiswhole movie. How is lex luthor not bald, and why is he being played bythis quarky guy who should be like the riddler or something. I feellike I waisted a hour of my time watching this garbage and I wouldnever put this in my top batman movie ever. Batman with Michael Keaton still rains supreme !
