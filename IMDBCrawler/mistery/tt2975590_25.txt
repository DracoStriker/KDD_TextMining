I had been waiting for a Batman/Superman movie for quite a while. I sawthis in theaters last month, and I was hugely disappointed. How anybodycould enjoy this is beyond me.It is certainly a well-made movie, but the problem is that it is simplytoo much. The entire movie was mostly loud explosions, overblown CGIeffects, and mindless set-pieces. I felt like I was watching a videogame most of the time. Is this what modern action movies have reallycome to?The film had almost no plot and very little character development dueto the excessive action and explosions. I felt that the Batman originwas rushed. Granted, it wouldn't have been exactly necessary to have along, detailed origin story, but it didn't need to feel hastily rushed,either.Ben Affleck was pretty good as Bruce Wayne, but we didn't get to seenearly enough Batman. Keaton and Bale are still the best. Henry Cavillis serviceable as Superman; he's better than Brandon Routh but he sureis no Christopher Reeve.I hated Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He felt more like a nerdycollege student than an evil mastermind. Amy Adams is kind of "there"as Lois Lane.The scene where Batman and Superman fought was kind of strange. Evenputting aside the half-baked reason that they are even fighting eachother in the first place, Batman seemed less like Batman and more likea black Iron Man. Wonder Woman's entrance was pretty cool, but sheultimately had very little screen-time and was basically shoe-hornedin.Also, the ending where Superman "died" didn't fool me for a second. Theimplication in the final shot that he's still alive was SO predictable.The film was extremely overwhelming in a very, very bad way. It hadvirtually no human touch at all, and I just didn't care about what wasgoing on most of the time. This is definitely not the film I have beenwaiting for. See this ONLY if you are a die-hard fan of these heroes,but don't expect anything great.RATING: D+
