I don't get the movie at all. There is no clear story line. The wholemovie is just a collage of unconnected scenes and fighting scenes. Thismovie exist only to show batman, superman and wonder woman in the samemovie. Scenes often get confusing, one moment you are in Africa, thenext scene you were elsewhere for no apparent reason and has noconnection what so ever with the previous scene. First of all, whatexactly warranted batman to go against superman, the whole reasons likevisions, dreams etc doesn't seem to justify batman to want to killsuperman. The story line is too forceful without realistic reasons toback it up. Whats the meaning for lex luthor to have those researchesabout people with seemingly super power. Another thing, if thekryptonite supposed to be that important why the hell did batman justleft it without a second thought and why did batman stop his intentionand all of a sudden decided to help superman just because superman saidthe word "martha". In the final battle against the made up commonenemy, how did lois lane knew that they needed to find the kryptonitethat batman left and suddenly just sprang to find it. Why was lexluthor arrested in the end? Since the only people who knew about hisintentions are batman and superman. How did the government decided toarrest him and on what grounds? In conclusion, this movie is a 2.5 hrslong pile of mess.
