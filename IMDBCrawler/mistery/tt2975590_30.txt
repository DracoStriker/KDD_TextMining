Not even worth a review. There really is no spoiler alert outide ofwhat you can see in a trailer, but just in case...Batman was horribly presented, and so was every other character. Theplot was just ridiculous and so was the integration of both villainsand hero's. This movie should have never been made with so much extrajunk. from wonderwoman, to lex luthor, to the made up villain in thismovie they call doomsday (the creation of him in a complete joke).also, what a horrible character to play lex luther. This movie iscomplete crap. Batman does not use guns, and he does not brand people.Superman could crush the bat suit in this movie.There is nothing toimply that he could not. It's not a special metal. Laslty, thekryptonite spear. Batman literally drops it for anyone to pick up andrealizes it half way through the climax in the ending. Louis lane insome freak accident managed to find it, and give it to them. The plotin this story is just the absolute worst in any comic book movie sofar. More so than tobey maguire's spiderman, and definitely more sothan the ongoing catastrophe they are calling the X-men.
