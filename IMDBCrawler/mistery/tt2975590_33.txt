Zack Snyder is the worst director for Superman, he clearly does notunderstand the character or maybe he does but he has a hidden hate forthe character. First of all this is a Batman Movie having a guestappearance of Superman which is also Batman punching bag in fact evenBatman left Superman with a scare so maybe the title would have beenScarface Superman. Now going to the movie it has like 80% of blah blahblah scenes which are extremely boring, 0 humor which I think is one ofthe greatest things Marvel did in their avengers movies, and for thefighting scenes they are also the worst, Dommsday? it looks like thecave troll from Lord of the Rings!!!! Why you have to do that? You havealready a doomsday in the comics! why change it? Lex Luthor Zack Snyderhad Bryan Cranston, and he hired this Jesse guy???? WHY!!!! and theyare paying millions to Zack Snyder, even a 10 year old child would havebetter ideas, and yes maybe the box office will be huge for this firstfilm as we wanted to see a good movie and we gave it the benefit of thedoubt, but after we were literally robbed from our money by a moviethat pretended to be a real competitor to the avengers we got a fiasco,will never watch any other film of DC comics unless they change Zackthe OVERPAID Snyder!!!! Don't WATCH the movie wait until is in HBO
