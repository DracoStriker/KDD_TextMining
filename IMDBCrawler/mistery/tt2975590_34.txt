First act of the movie is a mishmash of scenes that make you feel thedirector has no idea how to string thoughts together, it's just a smallscene after small scene, nothing to engage us, it feels like a cartoon.If what he was going for was to give us the feeling of comic bookpanels, changing from one after the other, it completely failed andbackfired, I literally saw 4 people fall asleep in the theater, one ofthem was my wife, who I thank for coming with me to this mess of afilm, I am sure it was as bad for you as 50 shades was for me.Second act of the movie, things start to streamline a little bit, youget a sense of character motivations and the feeling something big isabout to happen but guess what? At this point of the movie you are notengaged enough to care. Superman and Batman fight and like everythingbased on a Frank Miller "pissed off teen gager" fantasy, Superman isabout as worst written a character as it can get and Batman is acomplete bad ass, making Superman look like an idiot in every sense ofthe word. This is when you realize you are really watching a Batmanmovie with Superman as a guest star, this is no Sequel for Man ofSteel, it's also no "Shared universe" movie, it's a frank miller, fatarmor, slow moving, angry batman vehicle.Then we get to the third act, but in the meantime we get some horriblyput together scenes explaining us how the justice league will cometogether, almost as if they had forgotten to do it earlier and used upa free minute or so to add it in the movie, it was horrible.And the third act, we get wonder woman, which is the only good thing inthis movie but it's just a generic CGI battle with a generic lookingdoomsday. That's it.
