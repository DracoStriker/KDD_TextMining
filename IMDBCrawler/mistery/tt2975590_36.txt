You don't even need to watch the movie, you can just watch all thetrailers and there is all. Nothing surprised, and nothing shines(exceptwonder woman). If you want the batman to kill somebody, you'd better dosome explanation ahead.(the robin suit does give a reason but I justcan't feel the emotion! I know he's desperate, i know he's changed, buti just can't feel what he feels from the movie, that's the problem.They want the batman to be dark, but he's not dark from the movie, he'sjust too normal) This movie shouldn't be the second in the cinemauniverse, if it's the fourth or fifth movie that should be much better.As a second movie and the one to start a universe, this is so bad.
