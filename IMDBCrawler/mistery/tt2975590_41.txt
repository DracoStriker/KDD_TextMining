Let me start by saying..I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I loved it. Why? well somany reasons but heres a few. The tone. This movie wasn't justdark...it was scary. I never jump in the movie theater..I very rarelyhave the "holy crap reaction" But buddy..did I have both in this film.I jumped while screaming holy crap.Batman..Oh the many losers who crapped all over my man Ben. Were youmorons proved wrong or what?! Hands down the best incarnation of bothBruce Wayne and Batman! hands down! Even w/ Nolan's trilogy I stillnever liked or even really cared about Bruce Wayne. He was boring. Howcan I believe that this guy is waging a war against some of the worsthuman beings on earth but never sheds any blood? Yeah right.This Batman or Batfleck is real. He's messed up, shellshocked, warweary, suffering from probably a wicked case of PTSD and he's a killerwhen he needs to be. I believe this Bruce Wayne..I believe in hisexhaustion, I believe in his fear, his anger...I BELIEVE!I hear that some people wanted to see a lighter, funnier flick...Gowatch the Avengers..So much "humor" in that crap and couldn't even makemyself care about anything happening.The only thing i didn't care for was the final fight scene. could'vebeen simplified..more brutal. It was a little too ...i dunno..showy. Lex Luthor...I liked this psychotic Mark Zuckerberg that Eisenberg wasplaying with. I think honestly I was just happy to see a Lex Luthor Ihaven't seen before. Which is the trick with these characters..They're like 100 years old.And people are so married to the way they think they should beportrayed that in each movie you just get the same ol boring character.All in all I loved it..It delivered in a way that I was not expecting!
