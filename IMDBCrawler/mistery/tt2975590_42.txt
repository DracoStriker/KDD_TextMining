Good:-Good acting (for the most part).-Decent visuals/shot composition.-Bruce Wayne/Batman and Alfred.-Wonder WomanBad: -Horrendous plot development.-Shoddy editing.-Too many diversions and sub plots. -Superman is a plank of wood. -Jesse Zuckerberg was a complete miscast and just made the role dumbinstead of intimidating.-Shameless plug ins for the DC Universe, they were not even trying.-Horrid script.-Louis Lane did nothing of significance and just de-railed the wholeplot. -Unnecessary complex political themes which felt misplaced and handledpoorly. -Doomsday was genuinely terrible.-Ridiculous climax, so lazy and over the top it was almost like aparody.-Atrocious cop out ending making the whole drama and consequences ofthe third act utterly meaningless. Easily one of the worst films of this year, but then again 2016 isstill early so it probably wont be the worst for long.
