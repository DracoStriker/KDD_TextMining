Yet another batman story where the audience has to be caught up withhow he came to be. It's in every one of them. Ben Affleck is not Batmanmaterial. Jesse Eisenberg is not Lex Luthor material. So awful castingthat ended up screwing up the one guy trying to make the movie good.It's title is not fitting, it was Batman vs Superman for 15 minutes,then it goes to full on Superman, WOnder Woman and Batman vs Lex Luthor's evil GMO monster. The whole plot is absolute crap and it takes over3 hours and the ending is terrible. Looking at how much CGI they usefor these new movies, it's pathetic that the story line is actuallygetting worse in favor of visuals. Best action scene in the movie waswith Wonder Woman. This is another case of targeting people at the boxoffice with a name they know sells. Ben Affleck looks tired in thewhole movie, Jesse Eisenberg acts like his real self because to behonest, I didn't even know that he was Lex for the first 2 hours of themovie. Lex's actual hair color is red, and it can't grow back. Don'texpect dialogue in this movie, although they tell you how Batman wasmade, they still expect you to know everything about DC comics. Lexonly gets 20 yeas behind bars for causing an apocalyptic situation thatonly super heroes could sort out by risking their immortal lives. Thismovie was for Jew Economic Empowerment only, nothing else logical aboutit.
