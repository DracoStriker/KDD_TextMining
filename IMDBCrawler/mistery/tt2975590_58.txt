To be true, I have waited so long for BvS to become a reality and itdid. Had very high hopes from the movie but just when it was released,it downed my spirit by reading the critics. I even for a moment gotconfused to even go and watch the movie or no as I didn't wanted toruin the legendary encounter of these top class super heroes. Icouldn't resist and I went to see it today.Awwww man what a movie this is? !! Once again, Awww man what a moviethis is? !!This has been so far one of the best comic adoptions I have seen.Batman & Superman were at the peak of their acting. Class acting byboth. Wonder women (despite her small b***s issue) was exactly givingthe feeling of a wonder woman. Action scenes are insane. Makes youemotional and thrilled at the same time. Story was very well balancedand masterfully handled.The only thing which I didn't like was, Lois Lane's (Amy Adams) acting.She isn't fit for this. She couldn't live upto what she actually hadto. Looks like a kid lost in the park. Small glitches in the story telling as to how Lois Lane came to knowthat Kryptonite spear is needed to defeat Doomsday as she ran back tofind where she threw it? Who told her? That's one blunder. All in all,the movie is a must watch. I will surely go again to see it as Icouldn't fill my hunger in one shot. What the hell Critics said about this movie??? I believe Lux Luthor hassomething to do with it. LOL. I think he paid them well to say crapabout this marvellous movie, just another attempt to defame Supermanand Batman which he tried in all the movie itself. BvS: Dawn of Justice ?? Hell yeah? !!
