As a DC fan I waited 3 years for this film. I've seen this movie onceand that was enough. Man this movie is so god-awful there is hardly aplot or character development, nothing. I didn't care about anyone inthis film. That's not surprising as I feel like that in a lot of Snyderfilms. I do believe he is a terrible director and that 'Watchmen'should have been his last DC film. I have no idea why Hollywood or DCfor that matter promotes this man.I thought 'Man of steel' was a good reboot so why not just make asequel focusing on Superman, rather then cram the entire Justice leaguein one film. Also I don't like Ben Affleck as Batman, he's a good BruceWayne that's it. My biggest complaint is the movie is called 'Batman VSuperman' yet for 2 Hrs. and 45 minutes we get 10 minutes of that andit ends because of the most ridiculous circumstances. When did Batmanbecome a mommy's boy or Superman for that matter I don't recommend this senseless drivel of a film or the upcoming onesto anyone regardless if you are a fan. We deserve better then thisgarbage Warner Bros. Seriously watch TDK Trilogy don't waste your timeon this P.S Your 3 hour cut sucked
