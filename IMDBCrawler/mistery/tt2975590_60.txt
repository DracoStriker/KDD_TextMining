(Nothing but spoilers)Batman hates Superman. He really hates Superman. Why? Because peopleadmire Superman, almost deify him, and it makes Batman insanelyjealous. So Batman MUST kill Superman because he is in competition tobe the hero that people admire.So Batman gets his hands on some Kryptonite and almost kills Superman,but at the last second Superman murmurs 'Martha' which happens to beboth their mothers name, and Batman goes 'Boo hoo' and gets all tenderand weepy and completely forgives Superman and then Batman savesSuperman's mom which makes them BFF.In the mean time Lex Luthor creates a monster that serves no purpose inhis never revealed evil plans, and the monster kills Superman but notbefore Superman and Lois Lane have a tender "I love you, no I love youmore" argument. and then the dirt moves on Superman's coffin so we knowhe is not dead.For some utterly irrelevant reason Wonder Woman with really nice legsbut too small breasts shows up and joins the battle to kill theirrelevant monster, and she shows off her magic rope, bracelets andCaptain America imitation shield.Lex Luthor goes to jail where they make a huge deal of shaving hishead.Conclusions: Batman is a complete psychopath. Superman will letthousands of people die just to save his girlfriend. Lex Luthor is alame villain with no goals.
