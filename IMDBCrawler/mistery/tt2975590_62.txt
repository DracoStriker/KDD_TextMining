The obvious dumb plot hole is that all the Kryptonian tech is STILL onearth and in the hands of humans.Come on! As if Superman would have not sent all that crap in the sun tomake sure it does not fall into human hands. It's just too obvious to ignore.As well, the fight between the two is dumb, SM tries to talk to BM...ONCE, he does not listen, oh well it's all fight now. So many times hecould have just continued the conversation without any issues.It also makes Batman look like a dumbass. As if one of the bestdetective mind in the world would just fall to the conclusion thatSuperman must die because of a couple of things, without eveninvestigating himself.This gives you an idea how full of holes this movie is and it isextremely rush. They could have done something similar, but it needed 23 hour movies.
