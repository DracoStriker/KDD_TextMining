So... I finally watched it, and for the 1st 2h I did not understand howanyone could say this was worth a 6 or a 7... I did saw about the fakereviews. But it still didn't explain why it was still at a 6.9 after somany months... Then the last hour of the movie started and it madesense.So... First two thirds, it's a mess. They got 500 ideas, bits andpieces and decided that rather than being selective or work hard tomake it coherent... They would simply throw the whole mess in our facewithout any order or sense. Then once that's done you get the last 3rdof the movie, which is your more standard and linear plot. They fight,they make peace, they realize who's really the bad guy and fightagainst him/it. Enjoyable in a non-descript way. Still not a great plotand with the intelligence and psychology of a rock... But... it's anaction movie and this last part delivers action, battle and otherpopcorn pass-time, which is what I wanted.So it ends on a good (better?) note and it's easy to forget/pardon howtruly bad the first 2/3 were... And that's probably why it still is ata decent average. BUT considering how many action movies there are outthere... I would NOT recommend anyone to bother with it. Go watchsomething else, this one IMHO is not worth it.
