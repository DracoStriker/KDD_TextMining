The critics were right. As a matter of fact, they were too nice andprobably did not go far enough. This is quite possibly one of the worstmovies I have ever seen. This movie has no soul, no real depth ofstory, and an entirely weak premise.Executives who gave a pass on this should be fired. They are all great"yes men" who after spending a fortune to produce a steaming pile ofgarbage realized they had to release it anyway because there is a builtin box office for tons of sycophantic fans who will shell out goodmoney for any super hero movie. I would rather watch Plan Nine FromOuter Space ten times in a row before ever having to watch this fiascoone more time. The real indicator is how often I have to check the time during amovie. During a good movie, I never check the time because I amengrossed in the movie and don't even think about the time. In a badmovie, I keep checking the time to see how much longer I am going tohave to sit through the nonsense. Well, I was continually checking thetime and this movie had plenty of nonsense and absolutely no charm. Irelish the versions that hold to the charm of the original comics, likethat no one, including Lois, being able to discern that Clark isSuperman when the only differences are the glasses and the suit.The best thing about this movie is Wonder Woman who should have beatthe rear ends of these two whiny and ornery little boys and sent themto their rooms without supper.Save your money. Stay away. The studios will continue to crank outgarbage as long as you will pay for it. There should be a movement, aclass action suit, or something for people to get their money backafter having to pay for something that clearly wasn't worth it.Virtually no value for your money. If you want the studios to do abetter job, don't give them your money for a pile of garbage. Listen tothe critics more carefully next time and try to find a film worthseeing.
