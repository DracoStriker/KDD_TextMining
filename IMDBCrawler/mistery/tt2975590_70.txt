I went in with an open mind even after all the preliminary reviewsbasically ripped Snyder's Batman v Superman apart. All I wanted was tobe entertained. When I go to these comic book flicks I'm ready tosuspend a healthy amount of disbelief, let a couple plot holes go, andlet go of the real world if at the end of the 2 to 2&1/2 hours I felt Iwas entertained. By the time we got to the B v S showdown I had no ideawhat I was watching. The story was so incoherent I could barely followit. And I'm a comic book dork so I get the DC universe references suchas the omega symbol, the mother box, a character visiting a time linewithin the DC "multiverse", etc. I can't blame the actors as they didthe best with what they were given although Jessie Eisenberg waspossibly up there with Arnold as Mr. Freeze , Jim Carey as The Riddler,and Topher Grace as Venom as one of the all time worst depictions of acomic book character. I'd like to blame the film makers and theycertainly share a lot of the blame. But more than anyone I blame thestudio. They wanted to shove a showdown between Batman v Superman,Doomsday, The death of Superman, the dawn of the Justice League, andthe coming of Apokolips all into one movie without a real long termplan. Its a shame a film that should have been cant miss with two ofthe most iconic legends of the 20th century was a complete strikeout.The story telling is just awful.
