Batman V Superman marks the very first time I have seen a movie on itsopening night that has received a standing ovation. I never thought Iwould say it was better than the Dark Knight, but it is, and completelyeclipses Christopher Nolan's brilliant trilogy. Firstly, I am going tocast all doubt aside about Ben Affleck as Batman ? he is without adoubt the best and most accurate Batman we've seen to date ? if theAcademy didn't ignore films like these I would say a nod for Bestsupporting actor would be more than likely. Jesse Eisenberg as LexLuthor was also surprisingly good and very fitting to the role he wasgiven. However, there are too many great performances to mention, butit is fair to say the cast as a whole were absolutely outstanding andit is one the rare occasions where there were no existing weak links.The film is brilliantly written and carved to perfection by AcademyAward Winning Screenwriter Chris Terrio and The Dark Knight trilogyfront man David S. Goyer, who have created a rich and epic story thatexplores its characters effectively with surpassingly profoundemotional heft. Its perfectly weighted blend of humour, emotion,.action and a subtle political agenda make for an entirely compellingand unforgettable affair. It is superbly filmed, and Snyder masterfullyblends shots to create almost seamless sequences whilst establishing anemotional and compelling atmosphere. It truly sets a new standard forsuperhero films ? and a new tone at that. Ultimately, Batman V Supermanmay not be the superhero film that we want, but its sure as hell theone we need.
