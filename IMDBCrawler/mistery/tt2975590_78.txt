A film with both Batman and Superman in it should be superb... and yetthis film isn't. Even if you are willing to overlook Ben Affleck'sraspy voice and his lumpy, squished face when squeezed into the Batmanhelmet, or the lack of humorous riposte between Alfred andBatman...this film's super is superficial. Which probably has more todo with the film's overall surmise that Batman and Superman could, orwould be arch enemies based on a dislike for the collateral damage ofone another's heroic actions. Unless of course you believe that bothSuperman and Batman suffer such self loathing that when shown a mirrorboth would rather fight to the death than accept its reality. There is however one big flaw with this theory. Both Batman andSuperman are on the same side (good) and suffer no shortage of evil tofight. Yes, Batman may be dark and brooding, but if he can accept theloss of numerous Robins and most everyone he loves (acception beingAlfred) I think he can cope with the inevitable killing of a fewinnocents if one is defending the planet from aliens intent ondestroying every human being on it. As for Superman, the blue boyscout, he doesn't intentionally kill, full stop.So the story line is flawed and some of the acting is dubious, butthankfully Lex Luthor is deliciously evil and creepy! Louis Lane is notthe 'most galactically stupid woman in history' and there is one funnyline when Wonder Woman appears towards the end of the film. Does thissave the film from a fate of ultimate blandness...no. Are you leftpining for some humour...any humour, yes, sob...oh please... yes.
