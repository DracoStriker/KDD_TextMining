Compared to any of the previous Christopher Nolan films this, thenewest DC offering, must be an embarrassing effort for all involved. First of all, I just don't think anything can make Superman a characterthat anyone can relate to in the 21st century. On top of that, the plotis a hard-sell that just totally misses the mark. The theme of ademigod vs. a man (with gimmicks) is absurd. The film came off as contrived and dry, without any passion. In myopinion, this is at least partly due to the selection of Ben Affleckbeing cast as Batman, though he is certainly not to blame for thehorrible screenplay or bad directing. For me, this film was a total failure. At least, in the RichardDonner/Richard Lester Superman films, the comic relief provided by GeneHackman and Ned Beatty made the flicks worth watching. This lacklusterdud could have used some of that brand of comic relief to at leastbreak up the boredom.
