Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice has been the best movie of the yearso far. Every second was action. If you are wanting a great superheromovie to go see then this is the movie for you to go see in IMAX 3D forsure. Jessy Esienburg was a fabulous Lex Luther.Parents this movie is not for the fiat of heart it is definitely notfor the super little ones but still good for the kids to go see. Thekids will love the movie because who doesn't like Batman or Supermanthey are both wonderful superheros just different.I want to say this has been the best I have ever seen it was absolutelywonderful the whole way through.
