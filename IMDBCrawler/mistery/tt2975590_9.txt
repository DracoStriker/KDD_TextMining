Boy oh Boy....this was a great experience....I have to say after Man ofSteel (which was okay but by no means great), I didn't have muchexpectations from this, and to top it off the castings for this filmhad set the comic book fans on fire. But tell you what, this is epic.Some people are even calling it better than the Dark Knight, while Iwouldn't go that far, I would still call this a complete package.Affleck's Batman is AMAZING. His Bruce Wayne is not as cool and casualas Christian Bale's but he doesn't need to considering this is arelatively old Batman who has seen some very dark times. Hispartnership with Jeremy Irons adds some much needed lightness to themovie. Cavill delivered the dialogues during the fight scene withBatman in a near perfect way. Gal Gadot had a much bigger role to playthan seen in the trailers. And Jesse was good in a complex way. Fanshave to understand that his Luthor is not muscular as compared to whatwe have seen in previous Superman movies His Luthor is an evil geniuswho does a great job of pitting the two giants against each other.Jesse played the role to his strengths as he should have. Contrary tothe popular perception(especially after the third trailer) that thewhole movie was spoil-ed, the plot was way more deeper than weimagined. The only issues were a fight scene where CGI looked dull andmaybe, just maybe a bit over stuffing. But overall, this is EPIC.
