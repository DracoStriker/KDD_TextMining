If you haven't realized it yet, let me make this clear: Batman vSuperman: Dawn of Justice successfully managed to be the first liveaction flick about Batman and Superman and their clash, while itperfectly set the DCEU, introduced new thrilling characters (WonderWoman being the best example) and showed us a true Superhero film withreal issues and themes that we can relate to.All the while being a visually stunning film (one of the most beautifulmovies I've ever seen), with one of the greatest scores as well andthrilling performances. I can totally see Oscar nominations forcinematography, sound editing, sound mixing, original score, visualeffects, production design, hell even an acting nod to Ben friggingAffleck for his amazing performance (it'd really be a snub if thecinematography and especially the score categories don't get a singlewin).Jumping to the negative(s), the only thing that I spotted was theediting, with which I didn't have any problems but casual viewers feltthat it was rushed (some didn't know that the Knightmare scene was adream) and I just acknowledged it)...anyway it's completely resolved bythe Ultimate Edition (the original movie that the studio wrongly cut).The Ultimate Edition is an even better film btw which is fantastic.Some people point out Eisenberg's performance (I only saw complaints onthe internet really and I've spoken with a lot of people about thismovie) and some plot issues that are all resolved in the originaledition, or if you know the characters a little.Overall, it was a great movie, completely exceeded my expectations, Ionly have a concern against the studio because it didn't release themasterful 3hour version and because it showed us too much with thetrailers and TV spots (I partially blame myself, but the temptation andhype is real so...)+Affleck's Batman +The universe looks so comic-booky and it's AWESOME+Justice League set up +Knightmare sequence (Injustice tease? pleaseyes) +All the easter eggs +Wonder Woman +Visual pleasure +Had 2:30hours of eargasm +Fights were absolutely perfect...all of them+Superman putting a wonderful dilemma about god and gods' power +CGI isperfect-Editing was a bit off for the casual viewer -Trailers revealed toomuch (not really a - for the film but I had to point something out){My +++s that do not agree with the popular opinion}+Lex was fantastic, a powerful villain with a strong pov and abrilliant performance by Jesse +It was so interesting watching Supermanbecome the Superman we all know, even if he steps on grey areas +Batmankills because he's seen some beep +Snyder handled some sophisticatedphilosophical themes in a Superhero film like a proSo hyped for future DC films, bring it on guys!
