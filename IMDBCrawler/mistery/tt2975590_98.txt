Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheapthrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This moviestheatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped thestory leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the fullstory and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing thismovie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience mighteasily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of thefilm. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, andthe emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to helpthe world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast,and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from thisworld, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, beexcepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losingfaith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with hispowers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo
