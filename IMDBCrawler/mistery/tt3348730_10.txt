Even though people rarely admit it, the 'Saw' series has been one ofthe highest quality horror series ever made. 'Jigsaw' is the eighthentry in the series and there is still yet to be a bad film madeamongst them. Some are undoubtedly better than others, but I defy youto point me out one that is inherently bad. I also defy you to show meanother horror series (even any type of series at all is rare) that hasmaintained quality across that many films. That's why I was so happythat 'Jigsaw' was a brilliant movie, because if they had come backseven years later only to put forward a bad film for the sake of makingmoney it would have ruined everything. Luckily that was not the casethough.While this one does follow the formula used in all the past films, italso feels quite unique in a number of ways. The original seven filmswere all set within a very tight time-frame. This one of course ispushing ten years into the future. This adds layers of intrigue to theproceedings, because how could 'Jigsaw' be committing these crimes whenhe died all those years back? And you just know they're going to have abrilliant answer to that question.As far as the traps go in this one, I'm not too sure how I feel. Noneof them were bad, however none of them really blew me away either. Myfavourite one (without giving away any spoilers) was actually the mostsimple one in the film involving a gun. The psychology behind that oneis what I loved. I love when these films aren't afraid to beintelligent.The twist in this one also caught me completely off-guard. I've heardpeople say they weren't entirely convinced by it and felt that the filmcheated, however I disagree. Nothing is off limits coming in a 'Saw'movie. You have to know that going in. Altogether I absolutely lovedthis film and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is in anywayinterested in the genre.
