I was very excited when the first jigsaw trailer was online and myhopes were extremely high. When the film premiered I immediately wentto see it and my god I was mind blown by the plot and characters. Likeprevious saw films the story is some what the same with a few addedtwist to each characters background. The puppet looks very awesome withnew features added and Tobin bell still does the voice of him which wasvery amazing. I finally happy to see films like this getting back towhat the term HORROR is frankly there hasn't been any good horror filmsthat were great. Mainly nowadays horror films tend to be you're typicaltacky cliché jumpscares gimmick with annoying loud banging sound andmainly focusing on cheap demon/ ghost filth " the conjuring, thebabadook, bye bye man, ouija,sinister, oculus, paranormal activity andthose dreadful insidious films. Finally horror movies are getting backto it roots of pure horror because humans are the one that you shouldbe scared.
