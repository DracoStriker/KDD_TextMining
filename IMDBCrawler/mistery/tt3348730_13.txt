I'm going along with the crowd today where "Jigsaw" (2017) isconcerned; I concur entirely with the other reviews I've read. It's astory fraught with logical problems, but it's entertaining enough toplease fans of the franchise (of whom I am one). Based on my ownenjoyment of the movie, I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.Yes, some of it doesn't makes sense. And the twists and coincidencesseem pretty forced. There was another problem for me, as well ? at thispoint, the writers seem to have run out of ideas for the film series'trademark moralizing booby traps. (The one involving a grain silo isparticularly uninspired, and seems like something out a Bugs Bunnycartoon.)But what the hell. I'd be lying if I said that this was a movie thatdidn't distract and scare me. I think what attracts me to the "Saw"films is not the blood and gore. (Gory horror movies are a dime adozen.) It's the character concept behind their brilliant, mercilesskiller ? he's like a combination of James Moriarty, Rube Goldberg andone of the Inquisitors of old.Besides, I still like the twists. They may be forced, but they alwaystake me by surprise despite my best efforts to predict them.And I think every movie is made better by the addition of Callum KeithRennie. (He's a shady, grizzled police detective here, though he's farbetter than so clichéd a role.) I've always thought Rennie was terrific? he deserves the lead role in some sort of extremely dark anti-herofilm. (Are they remaking 2005's "Constantine" anytime soon?)
