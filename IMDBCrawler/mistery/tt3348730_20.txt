No doubt, Saw (2004) is still one of the finest bloody movies, allsequels were very good and enjoyable except 3D, I really wanted to havehope for Jigsaw, even the eight part sounds a bit too much for me and Ididn't expect for new SAW movie. After seeing Jigsaw, it was enoughsolid and interesting, but I just had some feeling that they made aneedless story because it wasn't so important for fans of Sawfranchise. Everything about this was just really solid, and the twistwas good one. The games/traps are not as strong/brutal as from previousSaw movies, but still made me interesting what will happen next. Ifound Jigsaw a less disturbing, but a little better than Leatherface.It's actually more detective movie and it doesn't feel exactly like aSaw movie, but however, it was interesting.7.5/10
