Hollywood's cash cow advantage for Halloween. The traps were meh. Tootamed compared to other saw movies. The twist at the end was awfulnearly the whole movie turns out to be one big flashback. Flashbacksare starting to become an annoying cliché both in movies and TV series.It's a sequel that didn't need to be made. I recommend not botheringwith this one.
