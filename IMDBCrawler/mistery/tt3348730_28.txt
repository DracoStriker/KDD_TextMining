Of course,its not my favorite part of this fantastic movie,BUT!I thinkeverybody knows,that a lot of movies which has continuation, becomingmore and more boring part by part.For example Pirates of Caribbean sea.i don't so like first 35m of movie.I saw it few hours ago,and at first35 m i was thinking that - Oh no,please,lets something happen,because ihave feeling,that it will be another movie,which makes me boring afterhis older parts,but this part,i can say,that makes me feel,what i wasfeeling after first,second and sixth parts...when you are starting tothink after the end of movie....and for me this is one of the bestcontinuation parts i have ever seen.Sure,there are a lot of not logicalmoments,but steel,for 8th part its brilliant work.Please make 9th partbetter...make Cramer alive,because you open that idea in 8thpart....thank you for not boring continuation.
