I'm not sure why everyone is hating on this film its the best saw filmsince SAW 3!(SAW 7 is an exception) loved the plot and the twist. Ifyou've not seen the last 7 films there is not really any point going tosee it but if you have then I'm sure you will love it! looks like thereare more Jigsaw movies to come!
