As a saw geek, i thought the film was a good film for an average moviegoer, but for a fan of the franchise i found it underwhelming. the "hehad another apprentice all along" was lazy in my opinion. The ideaElanor was really Cortbett from saw 3 carrying on jigsaws work (she wasaround 11 yrs old in saw 3, so the age ties in 7 years on) - this wouldhave been a far more inventive and plausible option than some randomcharacter that we are told was on the scene long before Hoffman andAmanda is too weak in my opinion. I also think, making you believeJigsaw is alive again, only to find out it is scenes from 10 years agois like giving a kid a Christmas present and taking it away again.However clever, leaves you disappointed. Frustrating. I understand theseries needed re-inventing for the new audience, but to forget its oldfan base and not have any mention at all of Hoffman, Amanda or DrGordon is like ordering Chocolate cake and getting trifle. whilsttrifle is nice, its not what you wanted. There are certain rules in asaw film that jigsaw sticks too, well so should the producers.. even ifthose characters aren't appearing, they should have included someone,even if in name only, especially Dr Gordon as he was alive and wellonly 7yrs ago and would have known about Logan surely. All in all, adecent film. For a saw fan though its a little disappointing
