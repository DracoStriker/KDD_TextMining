This movie had everything you would want in a horror movie, it had thecorrect suspense, dramatic elements, and the classic Saw elements thatmakes it unique to other horror movies. The ending of this greatblockbuster left me saying, "Wow.." and wondering how long it took tocompose this great masterpiece.There have been a few minor mistakes and plot holes, such as the timewhen Ryan finds out that there is no escape for either of them when thekey to his shackles are destroyed beyond use, the directors could'veadded something a little better to fill in that part. The CGI was alsoa little off, when Holloran's head was sliced apart, it looked as if itcame out of a Resident Evil Movie.In conclusion, I believe this movie was a good starter to kick off thenew trilogy, bringing in new fans from a new generation.
