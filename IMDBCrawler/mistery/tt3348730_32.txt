I was a huge fan of the original series, although as more films werereleased the thrill lessened. The first is a Classic and may have oneof the best twists of all time, and that's what makes it such a greatfilm. It wasn't about the horror.This one, although entertaining, same awkward acting by manycharacters, same grizzly traps, and most of all a twist, which Ibelieve everyone expects, however I feel there's some major plot holesthat leaves me feeling dissatisfied. Of course I won't ruin for anyone,but this film reaches far, way too far, in my humble opinion.Very reminiscent of the original, but fails in the end. Maybe they'lldo better next time because a new Saw film is always welcome to take aswing.Note: the red headed coroner was super hot, even before she let herhair down and took her glasses off. Way too hot to be a coroner. (notbeing sexist, just keeping it real)
