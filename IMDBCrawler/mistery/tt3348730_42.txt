The awfulness of Saw 5,6,7 are one to take notice to but the surearrogance of there attempt at revamping the franchise that should havedied after Saw 3 is one to take notice how to NOT make a successfulfranchise but the Saw franchise refuses to call it quits and just diethis movies manages to be both slow and awful kinda of like one thetraps that make no sense in the movie and seriously I have never felt amovie that was so long and drawn out about people I didn't care for anda plot so bizarre even for a Saw movie and the twist that it is 10years after Johns death but the twist that the traps he was placed arefrom 10 years ago but then the movie contradicts itself by saying afterthat game he survived they built a legacy together so the time linemakes no sense and also there were no hints that it was 10 years agowith the traps because one the traps has a flat screen TV in it reallyno one would notice that all in all there are very few good moments andeven fewer moments to reward fans of the franchise and unlikablecharacters and slow plot make a great movie heed my advice don't go tosee this movie and as for Saw just stop.
