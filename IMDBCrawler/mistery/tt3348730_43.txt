I'm fan of Saw franchise since I was teenager, so my hype about thisnew entry was so high. The movie has 2 plots, one showing 5 victimsneeding to survive to the dangerous games of Jigsaw and other tellingus the story about a police department investigating some strangerhomicides.The plot about the surviving group is nice, there are some creativetraps, however there's less violence and bloody scenes than in theprevious entries and also has some plot holes, for example Jigsaw seemsto know who would survive since the beginning. During the middle of themovie I was wondering "how's possible Jigsaw recorded a tape with thename of that character? How he knows that character is alive? He coulddie during the beginning of the game". Meanwhile, the plot about thepolices gives us some great twists and I'm sure you won't see themcoming.Jigsaw is a sequel with some reboot elements, doesn't change the horrorgenre, but is funny and I suggest it for who wants to turn off thebrain for 90 minutes and just enjoy a nice movie. It's not the best Sawfilm, however is one of the bests.Rating: 7/10
