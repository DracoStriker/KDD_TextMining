Saw is back and Jigsaw has returned to reclaim Halloween. But, you'llimmediately find yourself confused. After all, Jigsaw has been dead formany years. As soon as you start watching a lot of things just don'tmake even a hint of sense. Everything seems jumbled up... until thefilm's many twists and turns become clear and, with yet another risingcrescendo of the iconic theme tune, a series of flashbacks, big revealsand gory images, a Saw film once more concludes seemingly laughing atits audience and said audience will once more leave feeling sick to thestomach and very confused. Yep, Saw is back... for better or for worse?In this case, for better. Kind of. After the horrendous lastinstallment, the only good part of Jigsaw's legacy was the rollercoaster at Thorpe Park. Now... maybe things could be back on track. Ithasn't redeemed the franchise; the usual bad acting, logic gaps andlack of genuine scares still applies. But at the same time, thisinstallment prioritizes thought provoking moral themes and tension overgore and flashbacks and it is an intense, unsettling experience. Withmemorable death scenes, a reasonable amount of tension and a relativelysolid plot, this should be satisfying enough to most. It doesn'tentirely feel like Saw since virtually no-one, not even those stillalive, returns from the previous films and the grimy, uncleanatmosphere of the old films is replaced by a cleaner, more high-techvibe, but many will like the various nods to the past movies. 6/10
