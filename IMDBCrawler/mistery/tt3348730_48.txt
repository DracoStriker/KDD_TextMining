I have seen the first 3 movies in the series as the reviews of thesuccessors were not good. But I am happy that they made reference tothese movies. And this time no flashbacks!The production design and visuals (gore and blood) were genuine for theviewer to believe. The traps are quite forgettable this time but thetwists and turns were very good as I didn't see that coming in the end.An attempt being made by the directors to make it comparable with thefirst two installments. Though there are some flaws in the middle, butthe ending justified the shortcomings!Worth your money!
