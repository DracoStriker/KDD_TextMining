Although IMDb has demonstrated it as a crime , Horror and Mystery movieafter finishing the movie i personally think that it is a psychothriller movie. It has all those elements of madness and violence thata psycho movie has. But still whatever may be the genre it isundoubtedly an excellent movie to watch. One of the best in 2017. When i first saw it in the upcoming movie list it attracted me with thename. Then i have waited for it to release and finally after a longwaiting i have the opportunity to see the film. And truly after so manyexpectation the movie is quite capable of fulfil those. Always expectedmovies are not good and sometimes they really fail to hold the audience, their expectation. But this one is exceptional.The movie is about a man named Jigsaw who has been dead for ten years.But soon he comes to the light as a murderer as many bodies are foundall over the town. The mystery around the death of jigsaw and also thecauses of mass death is the main attraction of the movie. It leads themovie to a breath taking climax full of action and surprise. You cannot predict the ending and this is the beauty of watching it.Apart from all of its excellent aspect the movie has some limitationsalso. It is full of some violent and bloody killing scene...Manyaudience specially female may find it intolerable and nasty. Thedirector has tried to give it a horror flavour but failed to eliciteit. This movie has no need to be a horror movie . ..It is a thrillermovie..so they should have avoided this horror try.From all these discussion we can come to a decision that Jigsaw isanother success of 2017...
