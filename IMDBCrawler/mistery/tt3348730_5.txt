Very enjoyable saw movie with more backstory. Kinda funny at times butstill just as sick and twisted with plenty of blood and guts. You gottalove the bucket heads, an instant saw classic trap. Ending was mindblowing as always and I'm glad to see saw going back to it's roots.Cant't wait to see where this new trilogy will go. If you have seen thefirst seven saw films you definitely have to see this one!
