characters are really underdeveloped,plot twist at the end does notmake any single senseplot twist was really stupid i am not sure,but i think they even made amistake when it happened,like how did Doctor inspect those patients inpresent when at the end it is revealed that it has happened 10 yearsago,and the doctor is actually taking revenge in present?!So no,thedoctor that was inspecting them was not his past self,i just think theymade a stupid mistakeit fails to keep attention,the only thing that happens is that theysuffer and die,and after five straight minutes of that it just getsboringi think that the casting was okaythe thing that i liked were the effects,but you can't have a good moviewith only good effects and okay casting,can't you?i actually forgot that i watched the movie after an hour,it was areally forgetful movie.it had a potential,but the story was garbage. sorry if i made no senseat the plot twist part.
