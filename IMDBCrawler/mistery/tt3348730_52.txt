Dear readers, so here is I watched Jigsaw as part of millennialgeneration who loves to watch popular Hollywood movie and yes, Jigsawis part of cliché Hollywood horror movie: sadistic, full of surprises,and franchise with no ending series. If I am not mistaken, Jigsaw isthe 8th Saw movies, since the 1st when I was still in high school. Thecenter of this story is just the same, the old man, even I forgot thename, but his face is really amazing as a real psycho: no expression,no smile, and clear sentences. Well, for Jigsaw the plot is not sosurprise because it is connected with previous Saws, but the ending isreally sadistic, that makes me remember about Squid. Okay, that'senough. If not, I will be a spoiler. Enjoy Jigsaw with your friends!!
