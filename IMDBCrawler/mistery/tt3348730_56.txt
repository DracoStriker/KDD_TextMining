I was never a huge fan of the Saw series. I enjoyed the first one whichI thought personally was a pretty excellent horror movie. However afterthe first film, which did have a nice theme about life, the Saw filmsbecame more and more gore over substance. In the sequels the only majorfactor for these films to exist were the violent traps. We had thealleged Final Chapter in 2010, but when there is a chance for thefranchise to make money again, I guess it wasn't. This installment Iwill say is the best Saw sequel we have had up to this point (whichreally doesn't say much). Years after the events of the previouschapter, the Jigsaw killer has returned. However is it John Kramer ornot? This is the question that the main characters of the film try toanswer. However the plot is so uninteresting but also confusing,especially when keeping in mind the other chapters. I will say thoughcontinuity has never been a strength of the Saw films. Thecharacterizations were also unimaginative, and had nothing to say. Theyweren't even interesting. So we have a murder mystery without acompelling story, uninteresting characters and no interesting ideas.The film doesn't even have the luxury of offering any scares. Yea surethere were the easy jump scares, but I was never shivering when seeingthis. The traps are also not that gruesome, so even in that category itfails. The only thing I will say about this film is that everyone istrying. The direction is somewhat competent, all the actors are trying(some work, some don't) and they try to take Saw back to the roots ofthe original.
