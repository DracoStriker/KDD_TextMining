~SPOILERSAW movie looks good and cinematic.It absolutely watchable.I'm a fan of SAW movies but after i watched the film , i disappointedabout something.There is only one question on my mind : Where is Hoffman, Amanda ,Jigsaw's wife , Dr Gordon and Adam ? They were should be in the movie.Seven years later ... and my rating is Seven , too...~SPOILER
