The movie was overall very well directed/written. However, I did havesome issues with how the action played out. In the movie, several actors/actresses got injured in some type of way.The majority of these people seemed to have "forgotten" they wereinjured. You'd see someone gets cut by a saw, then magically have nopain just shortly after (or show no sign of it). The movie, however, was really good! I enjoyed watching and thesurprising twist at the end really threw me for a loop!
