This is a continuation or rebirth of the "SAW" series. I had startedwatching a "SAW" marathon and turned it off in the middle of the thirdfilm. The continuity was gone and it had gotten repetitive and boring.In this film as bodies turn up, it is believed John Kramer is back fromthe dead killing people, but how? The film runs between the policeinvestigation, and the puzzle scenes.The film has a nice little twist and the gore,torture, and blood waswell spaced. The film had some good characters that needed betterdevelopment.Guide: F-word. Brief corpse nudity. Severed body parts. Cool headsplit.
