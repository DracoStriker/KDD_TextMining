. . . is mostly famous for its Pig Farms. If there's a second thingbesides raising swine in which the Canadiayapping Populace specializes,it's serial killing. In fact, every few weeks the Royal CrackpotMounteback Police dig up a new instance of a pig farmer who turns outto be an active serial killer. This makes a lot of sense in the Realmof Canadia, since Science shows that hogs are the most efficient way todispose of slaughtered human corpses. All of JIGSAW was filmed inCanadia--half of it on a Pig Farm! If your fond dream is to grunt andmuck around in pig swill, go see JIGSAW. The term "Hogwash!" would bethe perfect adjective to sum up JIGSAW, if "Hogwash!" were not such anoxymoron. (Has ANYONE EVER successfully "washed" a hog?!) All of myfriends who had the traumatic experience of being raised in U.S.Northern Tier states recall being threatened with Canadiayapping Swinewhile little (as in, "If you don't finish your peas, you'll be truckedto Canadia and fed to the pigs!"). For a country so fixated upon itscarnivorous porkers, it's truly a wonder that Canadia hasn't beentotally over-run by their national rodents, lemmings, while no one waslooking!
