So Jigsaw the new gory horror movie is out and I said hey let's give ita try it had a great trailer with a great soundtrack and some uglytraps!! But don't get convicted by the great trailer the movie doesn't havemuch too offer , it was a mess from start to the end and mostly at theend.... So yeah I won't spoil anything ill just say that the end wasjust pure garbage! The final sequence was one of the worst worst endingever !!! I just don't get how dumb the last sequence was and how coulda director not had a minute to make it better .... the plot twist atthe end was fine but still it was ruined by that awful last sequence.The deaths weren't really good expect maybe one or two. It wasn't scaryat all.... but it still had some really awesome traps! The acting wasjust fine for some .... so overall it pretty bad ...... just like thewhole series.(expect for the first one and maybe the second one) soyeah don't watch it don't waste some money on it like I did. Watch ascary movie at home with your family you will have a better time andyou'll save money !!
