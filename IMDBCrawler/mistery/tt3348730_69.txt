Fun to watch but it's definitely like watching decent quality producedTV shows like CSI with a tiny bit of intelligence, just enough to makeLayman feel like they're smart. Enjoyable but not a masterpiece. Muchbetter than part 7 which was just awful.It was cool to see Scully back at what she does best...
