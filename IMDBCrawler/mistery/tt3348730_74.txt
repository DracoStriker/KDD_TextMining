I love the Saw movies don't get me wrong, but this movie although itwas filmed very well and even had its funny cool moments just seemedlike a repeat of something that was already seen. Do not get me wrong Iloved seeing the new torture devices, but to see how each of them diedand it ended up with no one winning, but finding out Jigsaw saved andtrained another person seemed very predictable and overrated. I thinkthis movie would have been awesome if turned out Jigsaw did notactually die and came back with an even more serious vengeance and didnot give people a chance, but killed them in his own selective way andthe last one to survive had a chance to save their own life. As far asthe ending for this movie I thought was predictable and repeated. Thismovie could have been so much better.
