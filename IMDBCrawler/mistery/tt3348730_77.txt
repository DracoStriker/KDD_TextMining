I've never been a huge fan of the Saw movies but this one was arguableone of the weaker ones (in terms of overall enjoyment). The first onewas great, and so was the one that preceded this very movie. In aperfect world they would've just ended it there. The greatest moviesthat I've seen end just like a well-written book; with unansweredquestions (so that they'll stay in our mind, long after we'veconsumed/watched them). That's where this movie went wrong. Instead ofconcluding the franchise with a little bit of mystery they'll turn thisinto a quick cash-grab. I can already foresee a seemingly endlessdeluge of sequels. I mean, they've already gone this far. It's not likethey'll just come to their senses all the sudden.
