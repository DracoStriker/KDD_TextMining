If you love horror/thriller type of movies you must have seen at leastone of Saw movies. It's been 7 years since the last Saw movie and withthis one Jigsaw makes a great comeback. Like all Saw movies this one isalso tied with the other ones and also gives you a new perspectiveabout the previous ones. The plot looks simple at first. Looking like aclassic John Kramer game where he wants justice and trying to teach alesson to his chosen players. But as the movie continues it gets morecomplicated and it keeps you on the edge of your seat which is great.And as we get to climax part of the movie the legendary Saw musicstarts playing and all of the things that you are confused about isexplained and you're just left with an open mouth. Because the plottwist is really good and a clever one. So i think this is a really mustsee!!
