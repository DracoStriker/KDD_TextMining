While the first Saw movie was the only one that actually scared me atall, the rest have been entertaining and creepy in their own right.This newest entry is given a new spark by the Spierig brothers, whoseawesome last film predestination probably should have gotten them abetter project than this. They still deliver a tonne of style andenergy (and better looking production value) then the last few moviesand still leave their mark on a franchise that could have easily havestayed as dead as Jigsaw's victims. The story itself was relativelyintriguing and the trap scenes are technically superb, and disgusting.You won't be quoting lines of dialogue after seeing it but the visceralimagery is nonetheless impressive and effective. A movie that didn'tneed to exist but is better than it deserves to be, and I'll take that.
