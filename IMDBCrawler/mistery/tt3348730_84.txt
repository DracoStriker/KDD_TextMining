After 7 years 8th saw movie finally arrived. Honestly, I had no bigexpectations and I had no intentions to see it on big screen, but I didit only because my FB movie group chose it for our first real lifegathering. And it was exactly what I expected it to be. Decent additionto cult franchise without bigger flaws, but nothing more than decent.It has nice pace and atmosphere, good acting and satisfying story.Twists did not shock me, but I didn't predict them either. But thistime traps were the weakest link. Some being completely unoriginal,just variations of traps already used in previous movies, some new buttotally unimaginative. Overall, movie is in upper half of the franchisebut traps are the worst so far and movie is for the first timeacceptable even for those with sensitive stomachs.6/10
