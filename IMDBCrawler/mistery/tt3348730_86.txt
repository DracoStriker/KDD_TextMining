I agree that JIGSAW is an unnecessary sequel in the SAW franchise, butif I'm honest the whole series has been unnecessary, aside from thefirst movie. This one's a densely-plotted lukewarm rehash of previoussequels and ideas, with five characters engaging in moreagainst-the-clock deadly traps while the detectives on the outsideattempt to figure out whether the killer Jigsaw really is back and onthe prowl again.As with the sequels, this is pretty confusing stuff although it allmakes sense towards the end, although I wasn't all that convinced bysome of the twists. An aged Tobin Bell returns to his role (thanks toone of the aforementioned twists) and is a welcome presence, and thetraps are gruesome and nasty, although not the most inventive of thefranchise. All together, this is acceptable fare, although not a filmyou'll want to bother revisiting.
