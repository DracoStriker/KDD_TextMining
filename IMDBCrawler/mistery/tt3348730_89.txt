I am giving it a 3 and it does not deserve more.The movie brings absolutely nothing new to the table, and is made likea huge flashback.Its story driven but its largely forgettable in the end and very boringin some parts.The Saw series should have ended with the last SAW 3d movie.This pushes the envelop to far, like the red head pathologist who recreated all of the gadget and has a special lounge with them. Its allgeared toward 2 suspect but you know its not them.The death scene are nothing original, if you seen saw movies you seenthem too.It does not feel like a Saw movie at all, the ambiance and everything.This movie could have gone directly to video not sure why it got atheatrical release.All in all i really hope this was the last SAW movie, everything asbeen done with this franchise.
