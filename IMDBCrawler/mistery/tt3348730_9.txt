Imagine waking up in a room; disoriented and surrounded by panic-stricken strangers, none of whom you recognize. An intimidating yetcalm voice rings over the intercom explaining why everyone is here andwhat is expected of you all if you wish to make it out alive. "I wantto play a game" Is the last thing said by the voice before theunexpected and gruesome first event begins. For avid spectators of thelast seven SAW movies, there was a lot of anticipation for this movie.Would they stick to the same formula used for last series, or createsomething completely new and unique? For those whom have never watchedthe last seven movies, they may generalize the genre as your standardcheesy horror? gore, gore, and more gore. But when it comes to the lastseven SAW movies they are all ingeniously connected with a great levelof complexity. The films are packed full of unique story-tellingtechniques: foreshadow, irony, twists, and turns, constricting timeframes, a question of right and wrong and sometimes asking the viewerto challenge their own morality. I was satisfied to see that JIGSAWvery much so followed the attributes of the old movies, and to thosewhom have never seen the last seven movies, rest assured you can stillbe a viewer and enjoy the complexity this film has to offer along withan understanding of the "why?" Yet if you're simply watching the moviefor a horror experience, you won't be disappointed.
