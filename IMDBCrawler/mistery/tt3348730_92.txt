At the time of writing this movie has a rating of 6.4 and I thinkthat's a bit generous. I have seen all the "Saw" movies but this was myfirst time seeing one during its first run, on the big screen. Whatsurprised me most is that it was such unimpressive viewing. It'sactually fairly dull. Even during the action sequences the film grindsalong at one quite leisurely pace through a fairly unexceptional seriesof "games", alternating - often jarringly - with some clunky andembarrassing dialogue from the stereotypical "investigators" that wouldbe unworthy of most TV movies. I have to say that there is some cleverplotting designed to mislead us and one major reveal that had meapplauding the writers. But they are a long time coming when you arewatching a bunch of quite bland characters meet their fates with adistinct lack of tension about it. Finally, here as in all the other"Saw" movies either the on-set lighting or some post-production makeseverything seem under-lit. I assume that is so the effects are harderto spot but it did get rather wearing to watch every scene through agrey mist. I don't think I shall be rushing back to the cinema for thenext one, but no doubt I shall be tempted back at some point, if onlyto see what happens next! Maybe the guy next to me in the theatre whofell asleep after 20 minutes had the right idea.
