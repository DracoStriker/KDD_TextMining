It would be totally fine if SAW franchise had ended at the 7thinstallment, however, I don't mind that there's a new one, let's breakdown why Jigsaw is the 8th installment, and surprisingly, it's not that bad, butit's kind of unnecessary and doesn't feel warrantedIt does have it's positivesThey have changed some things especially the visual style. When thetrailer came out, i was disappointed that they had done away the grittylook of the previous SAW films and are bringing a new cleaner visualstyle that felt a little less scary but after watching the film, i haveto say, the visual style is a breathe of fresh air and a nice change upAnother good thing is that the film focuses less on the torture pornaspect and instead it focuses more on solving the puzzle aspect of thetraps. They have toned down the violence, but i'm okay with thatbecause they did focus on making the traps more of a challenge insteadof a torture. But if we talk about the traps, yes there were a very fewmaybe one or two original and innovative traps but the rest were veryuninspired and a less gore-y versions of some traps from previous SAWfilms The film does have a cool and unexpected turn of events. There's aninteresting mystery going on and an intriguing "whodunnit" story linethat keeps you guessingLet's get down to negativesI know that the directors of this film, Spierig brothers are good attheir jobs and they know how to make a film and i really liked theirprevious film that was Predestination but here, even though they showedthat they understood the basis and core aspects of SAW franchise, theycould not manage to deliver anything too impressive or anything wehaven't seen before except the overall change of tone and visual styleThe writing is mediocre, but like i said it does have some cool twiststhat you may not see coming, it still is very clichéd and mediocre.Like always, there is excessive use of flashbacks to tell many parts ofthe story, which may not be a negative but excessive use is excessiveand can be considered lazy at timesI've seen critics mentioning the cringe-y acting and i agree that inmany scenes, some acting is very over the top and a bit cringe-y Wrapping up the review, i would say, Jigsaw is not as good as it couldhave been but its not the worst of the franchise. In fact, it may belike the 4th or 5th best film in the SAW series if i had to rank themin terms of quality I do appreciate that Jigsaw combines some of the best ideas of some SAWfilms and delivers some good moments but it barely does anything tojustify its existence beyond making more money for the franchiseIf you like most of the SAW films, you may enjoy this one too. Even ifyou only like the first few SAW films, i would say give this a chanceif you want to, you may end up liking it. It's an easy watch with asmall run time that doesn't drag too much and it's very fast paced.i would give it 6/10
