Why remake Murder On The Orient Express when there are so many titlesfrom Agatha Christie's bibliography that have never been made.Specially this one, directed in 1974 by Sidney Lumet - a genius athaving many great actors within a confined space, think 12 Angry Men -with a cast that was to die for. The 2017 Kenneth Brannagh couldn'tsurvive the comparison and it doesn't. I missed the elegance and thewit. Albert Finney got an Oscar nomination for his Hercules Poirot hereKenneth Brannagh's mustache will get all the attention as well asJohnny Depp's incomprehensible performance. Then, of course, the score.The original Richard Rodney Bennett became a classic. So, I ask you,was this necessary?
