I was a bit skeptical about this movie, but I must say I was pleasantlysurprised. Of course, it's not perfect, and sometimes Branagh overdo ita little, but whoever likes the genre will be captured by the fantasticatmosphere and will not be bored, because Branagh has been able to putsome pepper on the story. His Poirot convinced me and the old glorieslike Judy Dench, Willelm Defoe and Johnny Depp do their job and do itwell, but in my opinion the most interesting notes come from the youngpeople: I personally loved Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, but the realsurprise was Sergei Polunin: I mean, for those who saw him performingas dancer, it's not a real surprise, but it's really hard to believe itwas his first time in a movie! He has given to his character thismelancholy, turbulent and passionate aura, halfway between aShakespearean prince and James Dean. His expressions, his littlegestures, the way he looked at his wife, he made me feel like ateenager who cannot wait to buy his poster and stick it over her bed!And let me say, that guy definitely knows how to "handle" a woman aswell as he can deliver a kick! As usual, more the critics hate a film,more it worth to be seen.
