Although the story remains fairly true to the 1934 novel of the samename by Agatha Christie, this third screen adaptation (followingadaptations in 1974 and 2001) is a bit of a mess. And that's putting itmildly. Worse, and as ironical as it sounds, the film loses steam evenbefore the titular locomotive pulls out of the first act. An all- starcast lead by director Kenneth Branagh himself isn't enough, even withthe latter portraying Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot who turnsout to be more moustache than man. Which is sad, given that literarycrime fiction has Poirot second only to Arthur Conan Doyle's supersleuth on 221B Baker Street. But in this film, Christie's most famouscharacter is reduced to a mumbling idiot who would rather set both feetin horse poop just to make a half-baked point about order and balance. Shot on 65mm film, aerial vistas of a train trudging through the Alpssure looks pretty. The production design also boasts of lavish setpieces, plush backdrops, and costumes tailored to that era. But really,all we want is an old fashioned murder mystery. Perhaps an amazingdisplay of deductive reasoning before arriving at a twist ending?Surely, that isn't too much to ask. Add the mouthwatering cast in aplot that thickens into one of the most ingenious yet baffling casespenned by Christie and we have a first class whodunit in this day andage of cinema. But as it turns out, this was indeed asking for toomuch. Like the bloodied victim, something dies very early in the film.And that's before the story starts juggling the remaining 12 suspectsinto the 12 agonizing labours of Hercules. Or was it Hercule? Eitherway, Agatha would be aghast.
