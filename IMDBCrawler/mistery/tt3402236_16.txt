If you want to see Murder on the Orient Express, check out the 1974version starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot. It is a wonderfulmovie, very close to the book. And guess what.... spoilers...In this movie...Hercule Poirot does not get attacked by *any* of thesuspects, still less shot by one of them who also confesses to themurder.Apparently Brannagh thought modern day audiences couldn't sit through amurder mystery without 3 fist fights - and a shooting.Then of course there's the political correctness. It's set in the righttime period, the 1930s, but the doctor who has nothing to do with thecrime has been morphed with Arbuthnot, one of the killers - and is nowblack.I suppose that's okay, if it's true that one black man per medicalclass is allowed in, in 1930s England...but it's just dumb - and thefact that he actually shoots Poirot - when no matter who he may be,there's no evidence against him or the white woman he's in love with -is just stupid.Then there's the most egregious bit - the opening where an Iman, aRabbi and a Priest are accused of stealing a valuable relic at theWailing Wall where thousands of people of different ethnicities arewaiting. And of course it isn't one of these three religious people -no, it's the head of the British police who steals it in order tofoment discontent and cement British rule, apparently. Stupid stupidstupid.Then there's the fact that Poirot has been turned into Mr. Monk. Hesteps into a pile of dung with one foot. Poirot is a neat freak, and aclean freak, not a 'balance' freak. There is no way in hell he'd stepinto the dung with his *other* foot, to balance everything out. Juststupid.The actors do excellent jobs with what they're given. Unfortunatelywhat they're given is awful. I give 5 stars for the performances, andthat's it.
