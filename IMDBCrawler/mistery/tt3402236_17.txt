I must admit as an Agatha Christie obsessed fan, my initial thoughtswere of pure joy, it's been a while since Agatha Christie was on thebig screen, appealing to new fans, and how magnificent that such astellar cast was assembled. Then I thought, of all the titles, why gofor such an obvious choice, which has been done several times.Firstly, the film is undeniably beautiful, the costumes, sets, filmingetc, the film will undoubtedly win an Oscar for the visuals. You cansee big money was put into the look of the film.My major irritation throughout, was his moustache, just absurdly overthe top, when Depp and Pfeiffer should have been dominating scenes, allI could look at was that moustache. That apart Branagh was excellent, Inever thought he'd carry it off, but he did.I am intrigued as to whether this is a one off film, or if there'll bethe odd appearance on the big screen. Only time will tell.All in all, it was good, I wanted and hoped to absolutely love it,unfortunately I didn't, but no way is it as bad as some say, too muchquality for that.7/10 (hoped for a perfect 10!)
