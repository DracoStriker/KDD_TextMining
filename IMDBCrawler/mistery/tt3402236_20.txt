I haven't seen the 1974 version so this movie easily stands out in allaspects to me, whether it was the camera view or the cast ensemble.While reviewing, people often forget the issue with the original storyi.e. it's set entirely in the train. Considering the limited space thatthey had, Branagh does an amazing job with the direction. This isn'tjust a remake but in fact an entirely different adaptation. Not that itruns away from the main story but it has a sort of different take onit. Apart from that, Branagh easily manages to portray Poirot with allhis eccentricity. (The accent was the pull factor for me). Josh Gaddoes an amazing job with Hector McQueen. Judi Dench shines as PrincessDragomiroff along with Pfeiffer as Mrs. Hubbard. The only bummer wasthe fact that it leaves you wanting for more.
