First of all this review comes from a guy who haven't seen the originalfilm and I'm actually very happy that I didn't, I've seen and read mostof the people reviews and the one thing they had in common that theremake of this film was unnecessary and I think that's just the moststupid thing I've heard, every film that have a remake people just toseem to hate even before watching the film and that's really justsummes up the ignorant of that person.From the novel by Agatha Christie, Murder On The Orient Express isabout a man tries to solve a murder that happened in a train voyagewith thirteen people on board and everyone is a suspect due to anunknown murder that happened at night.I just LOVED everything and every bit of this film, it's just wasamazingly director, one of the best performance I've seen this year,the way the story was delivered was just genius with a greatcinematography that was simple yet breathtaking and of course afantastic score by Patrick Doyle that fitted the film perfectly. Mr.Kenneth Branagh, I really don't know by which way or how to praise agenius that he is and also don't know what exactly do I praise himabout, is it his direction of the film and the fact that he director awonderful looking film with great cinematography or do I praise hisacting performance which is THE BEST I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR ! I reallydon't often praise films like that and I'm the kind of person thatlooks deep in any film just to see any misconceptions or flaws and Ireally was searching in this one but I really didn't see any ! Yes Iwaited for the film for about 5 months but honestly speaking I reallyforgot about the film.I don't recall many films that I've seen and didn't see or faced anyproblems or flaws with, this film was just Perfect, the fact how funnyit was or the fact that the film looked great in a big screen or thesoundtrack that made most of the scenes made more sense and veryemotional especially at the ending !If I'm going to describe the film to anyone I really have only one wordfor he/she and the word is: Perfection.I really wish that the academy awards appreciate this film andespecially to at least nominate Kenneth Branagh FOR AN Oscar !Overall: One of the best films I've seen this year and nearly as THEbest film, Murder On The Orient Express in opinion was just wonderful,beautiful, funny, sentimental and as I said I rarely compliment anyfilm as I've done for this one and it's just simply because the filmwas perfect.
