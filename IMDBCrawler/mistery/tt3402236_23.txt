This is an updated version of the 1970s film version of the AgathaChristie novel. Most people recognize the name Agatha Christie, famousnovelist. Christie wrote mystery novels, very good at that. Her body ofwork consists of things like murder on the orient express, and thenthere were none (also made into a film), the ABC murders.... plus more.I saw the 1970s film when I was probably too young to see it, butremember it being intriguing and having a very unexpected ending. Iwill say that for this remake, both of those things still hold true.There are intriguing parts of this movie, and it has an unexpectedending that I really liked and I thought was cleverly done. OK so let'stalk about the plot and how it was executed. The plot isn't all toooriginal at first glance. There are a number of passengers on a train,none that having any relation to one another, among them is one of themost famous detectives in existence... and one night the train suddenlystops. They check one of the passengers rooms and discover he's beenmurdered, stabbed. Immediately, this detective goes to work at tryingto discover just who might've had an alibi, but what he discoversreally thickens the plot. I won't say what he discovers, just that itmakes the film much more interesting and really makes your ears perkup. The acting was well done mostly. I loved Michelle Pfeiffer in herrole, Penelope Cruz was good in hers, Johnny Depp fit his well, JudiDench was impressive as always, and Kenneth Branagh was just perfectfor the starring role as Hercule Poirot. The dialogue was good for themost part, there were a few parts where things got a bit dull, and myattention did wander a couple times. That is really the only reason therating isn't higher than it is. All in all though, it is a pretty goodfilm that will entertain most people who are fans of this kind ofmovie. 7/10 for Murder on the Orient Express.
