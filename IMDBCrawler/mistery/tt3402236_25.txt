On the whole I think it is a nice, well-done movie, I really enjoyedthe unusual camera perspectives, the acting too, but in some scenes itwas a bit over-dramatic. I have seen only one preceding adaptation ofthis Poirot story, and it was the one in which David Suchet formsHercule Poirot on screen and I have to say that I liked that film muchbetter, than this new one. It's my personal opinion, maybe just becauseI've already seen another perspective I cannot be objective in judgingthe new one. I give still 7 points out of 10 for it, because it is tillenjoyable and I can recommend to watch it - at least once.
