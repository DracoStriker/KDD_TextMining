I went to see Murder on the Orient Express last night and this is myreview. I am rating it 10/10 Cut to the train - at last. We hear thatthe train is full and that Poirot will have to share a cabin for atleast one night. As we discover that there are just 12 passengers onthe whole train I wondered what happened to all the other empty berthson the other carriages. Let's just pass over that one. I really enjoy afilm that keeps you guessing and gives you a few unexpected twists. Theorient certainly delivers that. All the acting was very much splendid.A group of excellent actors together with a fine plot and diffusesuspense has made it a good enjoyable movie. The production is indeedrich and elegant in its production design, and cinematography. Thecostumes however are fine, but lack a certain panache and glamour wehave grown to admire in past Agatha Christie films, such as thosedesigned by Tony Walton, and Anthony Powell. Kenneth Branagh is such agifted filmmaker he created a great film The music score in this filmis at a high level.
