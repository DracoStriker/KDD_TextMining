I was completely unfamiliar with the story of 'Murder on the OrientExpress' going in. I had of course heard of it, however I had neverread it, nor seen any of the previous film adaptions of it. I am verypartial to a murder-mystery however, and so I was very excited for it.Adding to that excitement were a tremendous cast (including my main manJohnny Depp himself) and a trailer that blew me away. Now all the filmhad to do was live up to the hype I had created for it. Did it manageto? You bet it did.The thing that took me off-guard was that Johnny Depp was not only notthe star of the film, he was actually playing one of the leastinteresting characters in the whole film. What also took me by surprisewas how much I enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of thecharacter of 'Hercule Poirot'. He was captivating to watch. He left meundoubtedly wanting more. I would happily welcome a follow-up film(which may or may not have been hinted at in the film).There's a lot of fun to be had in 'Murder on the Orient Express'. Whileit is a dialogue heavy film, it is exquisite dialogue. The amount ofmemorable quotes in this movie are far too plentiful to count. Thetwist at the end (which I'm assuming is the same as the sourcematerial?) was probably my least favourite part of the film, however itdid make sense and I get it. Otherwise though this is a very hard filmto find flaws in. Definitely a film not to missed.
