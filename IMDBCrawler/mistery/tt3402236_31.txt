I really enjoyed this movie even though I adore the original. I went inwith mixed feelings and the fear that this would be a typical horribleHollywood remake, well it wasn't. Especially with a star cast like thisit would have been easy to just let the writing and directing slide byso my fear was not that irrational. Branagh absolutely shone in hisrole as Poirot just like the rest of the cast did in their roles. Surethey added to the background stories of the characters but whyshouldn't they? And are people seriously complaining that they added ablack doctor? Seriously people. I was afraid they would americanize itbut they didn't. This movie is not worse than the original. It is notwithout the Christie Charme. This is the best movie I've seen thisyear. I enjoyed it immensely and will absolutely watch it again.
