Kenneth Branagh does it again. For many years the sniffy set ofGuardian-types would turn up their Metropolitan noses at AgathaChristie. Her writing was, evidently, not high-brow, she churned outtoo many and (horror of horrors) she wrote airport thrillers. But Christie understood human nature in its myriad forms and she wroteaccordingly: at times with brilliance.It is this which Kenneth Branagh so fabulously unveils in his Murder onthe Orient Express. Yes, he has assembled a world class cast ofsuperstar actors, but it's Branagh himself, both as actor and Director,who pulls the real meaning of this story out.This is a tale of loss, sorry, unrequited grief and, above all,revenge. You don't get much more powerful emotions in human existenceand these are wonderfully executed here. It's fantastic, even if you know the plot. Go and see it and watch thiswonderful tale again from a different perspective. Don't go just forlight-hearted entertainment. It is that on one level. But it's also atale which plumbs the depths of human existence: what Poirot calls 'thepoison of deep grief.'Fabulous film.
