I did not mind the digital snow. What I minded was the lack ofcharacter development that reasoned in very shallow characters whichconcluted into a film that dragged more than it deserved. Don't get mewrong. I still liked it. But when you waste a cast of such tremendousactors like Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer and Willem Dafoe it isdestined to end up in a disappointment. I also do not try to compare itto the nearly flawless original of 1974 but if I did and see where theother one succeeded and which this remake failed it comes to one bigthing: The fantastic investigation and interrogation scenes, which werehere rather shallow and unimpressive. But to sum up the good things:Cinematography was fantastic. The images we got were outstanding andunforgettable. It created a nice atmosphere. I did like the score, evenif it was a bit inconstant at times. The Production Design and generallook were extremely satisfying. Some of the acting was good too.Kenneth Branagh for instance did a great performance as Hercule Poirotand perfectly nailed that character. I would not mind to see himrevisiting that roe in the future again. Michelle Pfeiffer was greatand the only time when I say one of the cast was better than itsoriginal counterpart. Johnny Depp held himself very well. No complainsabout him. Penelope Cruz was fine, but she is no Ingrid Bergman. JudiDench was wasted but I did enjoy her scenes. Daisy Ridley also showedsome versatility and I always like Willem Dafoe doing Germans accents.So yeah no complaints about the cast itself, just about the materialsome of them were given. Sometimes I felt they were given the mostemphasize on Branagh' schnauzer than on the characters, who actuallyare what makes the story interesting.
