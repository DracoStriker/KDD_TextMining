I enjoyed the film as it was a night out. It didn't quite meet myexpectations but then again I had heard mixed reviews. I guess what itlacked was just that feeling of atmosphere in the carriage. Did weparticularly see an evening on board with a meal served ? As they saidwe didn't really get to know the characters terribly well beyond a fewcaricatures. I got a little mixed up with the Johnny Depp character andanother man who looked quite similar. But overall a good story-go andsee it - Kenneth Branagh was good but the moustache was over the top !!And the mix of French (with a translation which I guess you had to dobut as I speak French this seemed ridiculous !!) as he spoke a fewwords of French so we know he is Belgian then into English ! Butoverall I enjoyed it. Go and see it - its a good film and I hope to seemore as I love Agatha Christie and all mystery things like this. I hateCGI but can see it probably saves a whole lot of money in a film likethis. Thanks all though - enjoyed the film.
