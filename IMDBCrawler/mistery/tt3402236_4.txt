When I first saw the cast line-up for this film, I thought it was goingto be a masterpiece. Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp etc. Thelist goes on. But, it goes to show that a brilliant cast cannot make-upfor mediocre. I'm being careful to avoid spoilers here! The film starts with arelatively entertaining light-hearted action sequence which bringsPoirot to the forefront of the story-line. But, it quickly goesdownhill from here. We are then introduced to the rest of the cast andwe quickly learn they all have their own stories. After this though, the film becomes incredibly dull and slow. Thisremake is completely unnecessary and tedious I have only given it 5 stars because I have significant respect forAgatha Christie's Poirot and it is only the base story-line whichrescues it. Boring acting and predictable plot-twists. Most definitely mediocre.
