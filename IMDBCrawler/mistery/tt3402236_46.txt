The scope is massive without it being a stupid brain-deadeningsuperhero movie (God, someone shoot Marvel and DC dead...video gamescome to life are not FILMS!!). This is real filmmakers making a realfilm, and by all critics who've bashed this film on this site haveoverlooked, it is as patient of a film you will see. And if we're towish pure storytelling to exist in the future, this is a reason to holdit tightly to your chest. Instead of beating the drum to comic bookheroes. In this case it is a simple detective tale with charactersstuck together in order to solve crime. Director Kenneth Brannagh seemsto have an affinity towards both the source material and the SidneyLumet 1974 version (the train full of stars). So what if you knew theanswer to the who-dun-it. You know how most Thor movies end (here's thehint, with your brain melted and fat from stupidity). This film isphotographed as old Hollywood. Something desperately missing are, lesscuts and more staging. This is the film that showcases it with a greatdeal of zeal. It's exciting to see camera angles from the heavens thatpeep in on a intimate conversation. THIS is filmmaking. Or that we seemultiple characters introduced throughout the train as backgroundcharacters. Or that there is a coziness to this like playing the boardgame "Clue." And to top it all off...there is a deeper idea with thedetective's story that wasn't in the 1974 version. Can I defend this tothe simpleminded film goers today who lambasted this film foreverything making films is all about. Oh right, most of you have orwill never make a film in your lives. That's why you watch movies andnot films. See this movie and re-calibrate your compass to how they'resuppose to be made.
