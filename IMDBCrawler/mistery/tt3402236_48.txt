(This is less a traditional review than some scattered thoughts):First thought/complaint: How in god's name are they out there in whatis supposed to be cold and sub-zero enough to give everyone "exposure"for so long in just regular jackets and coats? Come on, Kenny my man,do better than that. Second thought: while the best Agatha Christie movie of this decadestill is and will likely remain The Hateful Eight, this is engaging,dramatic and full of robust performances (Johnny Depp hasn't been thisgood/sleazy in a decade, even as he has a relatively small role,luckily it's not the size but the keyness of it). It actually helpedthat I hadn't seen another version of this story - yes, shame on me fornot seeing the Lumet one, I'll get on it soon - and the ending wassadder than I expected, which is good. Branaugh keeps his audience onhis toes and there isn't a false note in the performances.Third thought: This is not directorially up to par with Henry V andHamlet, but I'm glad to see Branaugh still has it in in him to make afilm full of vitality and visual ideas that are a little wild and alittle of the usual (black and white flashbacks, really?) But where itcounts, the movie is fully involving and the story shines however youcut it - in that way I'd rank this alongside something like the recentGreat Gatsby adaptation: as long as you really get the goods right, anddon't go TOO crazy stylistically, what works will shine through (also Imean, Pfeiffer, Dafoe, Cruz, even Josh goddamn Gad are stand-outs, andRidley's fine too though now she just like has to do a movie where sheand Kiera Knightley are sisters, right, like that has to happen nowcontractually).Oh, and the CGi... eh.... But my positives outweigh the negatives here.Mostly. It's a wonderful whodunit story that kept me on my toes and hada procedural tone that kept me wholly invested. Not to mention,naturally, that giant mustache that is like a mustache that grew amustache - or, more to the point, the Human Stachipede.
