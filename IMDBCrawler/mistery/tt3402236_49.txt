I thought this movie was great! I love a good thriller/murder mystery,but movies nowadays are all about the gore and horror more than thestrategy. There is a point in the movie where you realize there are toomany coincidences and you can pretty much guess who the killer is, butyou really can't say for sure until the very end. I loved all thescenery and vibrancy of the time. Each character in the film is verymuch their own and unalike others. I have never read Agatha Christienor seen early versions of this movie, but I really enjoyed her plot. Ithink the classic murder mystery needs a revival because very manythese days leave me feeling down about the world, but coming out of thetheater from this one, I felt satisfied. For those wondering, there wasno foul language and no sex scenes, so, besides a scene of violence,it's pretty safe for all ages to see. I hope I see more movies likethis coming out.
