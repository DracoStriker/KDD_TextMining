Why did Kenneth Branagh want to make a third version of this classicAgatha Christie story knowing remakes of classic films rarely aresuccessful?The previous two versions the film in 1974 with Albert Finney asHercule Poirot and the 2010 television version with David Suchet areboth superb.If you haven't seen either you probably may enjoy this as I don'tcriticise the acting or production . It's an interesting cast I enjoyedMichelle Pfeiffer in the role of Caroline Hubbard so classily played inthe original by Lauren Bacall and Branagh gives a credible performanceas Poirot.What I missed was the elegance of the original the original score byRichard Rodney Bennett is one of my all time favourite film scores,used so evocatively in the original film it gave the Orient Express anidentity motif forever etched in film history.The music score in this attempt is bland and the song at the endcredits so saccharine sweet and forgettable I've forgotten it already.If you make a remake film that's so well known you can't help comparingthe original cast and in 1974 we had Albert Finney, Ingrid Bergman,Lauren Bacall , Dame Wendy Huller , Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, JohnGielgud , Rachel Roberts and Vanessa Redgrave to name a few , yet notone of the new cast including Dame Judy Dench eclipses any of theperformances of the original film . The costumes and sets are very goodin this version but again in 1974 even without blue screens and cgieffects the elegance and luxury of the original is not improved withthis version. So to me the good performances and production of thismovie were wasted on this expensive film and the tweaking of the storyline was totally unnecessary and in one instance concerning theCaroline Hubbard role ridiculous.Without giving anything away or spoiling it for audiences who haven'tseen the original, apart from recommending the 1974 version to this oneI was horrified at the hint at the end of the movie that KennethBranagh may remake "Death on the Nile"I sincerely hope not. What nextwill we a have Kenneth Branagh remake of Gone With The Wind startinghimself as Rhett Butler and Anne Hathaway as Scarlett?
