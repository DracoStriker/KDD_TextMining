Kenneth Branagh giveshis performance of Hercule Poirot, an intelligent (seemingly) OCDdetective who separates right from wrong and serves justice to thosevia his deductive reasoning and "little grey cells", which is fantasticdespite the shrub growing off his face (which eventually passes asunnoticeable). In fact, "The Murder on the Orient Express" emitsspectacular performances from all cast members, who all manage toextract perfectly dramatic and interesting performances at appropriatetimes - particularly Josh Gad, who also starred as Olaf in "Frozen",who gave a great performance as Hector MacQueen.
