No I have never read the book, or seen a film that was made over 40years ago, but I do love the 'myster' genre and this film didn'tdisappoint. Beautifully directed and produced. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Ican understand why people might dislike this film after reading somereviews. But I had no expectations of this film. Lovely.
