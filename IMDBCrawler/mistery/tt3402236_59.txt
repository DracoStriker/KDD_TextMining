First of all, are you kidding me? I'm reading all those reviews how the1974 movie was far better, how the ending is ruined and blah, blah,blah... Come on, guys, this is Agatha Christie, it is supposed to beentertaining, funny, clever. And yes while I was reading the book, inmy head, most of the characters looked like this (even Depp). Yes,maybe Walz could be a better choice for Poirot, but Branagh did a finejob. Everything is shot beautifully, the costumes are just marvelous,and the cast is mostly A class which you just can feel through theentire film. In conclusion, I liked it! I've watched a lot of Poirotstories, even the old English TV series and this movie left me with asmile on my face. Job done!
