I went to see Murder on the Orient Express last night and afterwardsthought what was the point? Did Kenneth Branagh do it for selfindulgence. In 1974 it was great to see Albert Finney, Laureen Bacall,Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connerry etc playing the parts. There was a stilla certain mystique about film stars, especially the ones fromyesteryear. Now on the Graham Norton show we can see how vacuous somany of them are. Yes the scenery was spectacular. The costumes weregreat. But honestly, really honestly other than having several AListers or B+ Listers who hardly open their mouths and a HerculesPoirot in Branagh not in the same class as Finney or David Suchet Iwould say that TV does these thrillers much much better these days. Theopening scene in Jerusalem was like something out of Raiders of theLost Ark. But Poirot is no Indiana Jones. The ending which tells usthat we can prepare ourselves for a remake of Death on the Nile. Nothank you, even if Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks are in it!
