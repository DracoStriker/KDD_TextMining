The second act stuff on the train is actually rather well done for themost part, with the dialogue-driven detective 'leg-work' of 'Murder OnThe Orient Express (2017)' being fairly interesting if a littleconvenient, but unfortunately the surrounding material is relativelycontrived and oddly clichéd, with Poirot occasionally coming acrossmore like Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes - complete withalmost clairvoyant levels of 'deduction', especially in his fewextremely out of place action sequences - than a portly and particularBelgian; the ending is especially disappointing, though this is a faultwith the source story more than the flick itself, and leaves thingsseeming rather empty after its ham-fisted attempt at both haphazardlystarting and completing an arc for its perfectionist protagonist,though it doesn't quite sour the film's finer moments - which stillshine through the muddy mess that this finale transforms the narrativeinto - and can't quite ruin what was mostly an intriguing andentertaining journey. 6/10
