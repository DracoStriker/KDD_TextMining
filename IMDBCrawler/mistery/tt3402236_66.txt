This movie was a bit of a shock for me. I saw all the trailers, andsaid to myself each time after seeing them, this is going to be great.For the first half of this movie I was right, it was tension filled andentertaining. It took me right along for the ride and I felt like I wasthe detective solving the mystery. But as I kept watching, my interestkept leaving me, I watched this movie deconstruct itself by the minuteand by the end, I found that I had forgotten the overall point of thismovie. All of the character alibis became more and more convoluted as Icouldn't solve this mystery what so ever. Then once it tells me whatactually happened it seemed so stupid that I felt very unsatisfied withthe final product. I was so excited to see this but I walked out ofthis movie not disappointed but more confused about why I saw it in thefirst place. I couldn't keep up with it all, for those that could, Isalute you.
