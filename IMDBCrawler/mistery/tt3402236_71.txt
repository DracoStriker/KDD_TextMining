Movie Review: "Murder On The Orient Express" (2017)Fully-spiked with Hollywood stars in playful mood to indulge on SidneyLumet's 1974 classic movie adaptation ?Murder On The Orient Express"based on Agatha Christie's novel published on January 1st 1934,Director Kenneth Branagh, who also performs in the leading role ofHercule Poirot, shares his passion for the original film withskillfully designed shotlist of long tracking shot and creative anglechoices by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos accompanied to anemotional, visuals uplifting score composed by the director's long-termcollaborator Patrick Doyle.Major production values of an quality picture produced by ProducerGuild of America (PGA) members Mark Gordon, Simon Kinberg and RidleyScott find their extravaganza in splendid costume design by AlexandreByrne and further production design by Jim Clay, who gets compromisedby budget-restraining digital extension procedures, shaking at timesthe snow-covered exteriors to the otherwise rock solid interior setdecorations to enjoy for the schooled spectre's eye. The pacededitorial of slightly less then two hours leaves no trace of complains,yet Director Kenneth Branagh denies the remake an original exceedingsuspect pursuit scene to play out as center action landmark.Actor Johnny Depp, filling in with dark-siding beats for the originalconceived part of actor Richard Widmark (1914-2008) as the nemesischaracter of Poirot's murder case Edward Ratchett. Together with actorKenneth Branagh, he builds the strongest scene in ?Murder On The OrientExpress" of power struggle proportions in the train wagon's restaurantunder a golden nut cake served with two forks. The ensemble castsurrounding Dame Judi Dench as Princess Dragomiroff, Daisy Ridley asMiss Mary Debenham, presenting herself surprisingly detached from hercareer-defining character of Rey in the ?Star Wars" movie series,Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline Hubbard to challenge antagonist Ratchetthimself.Further supporting actors as Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz, Josh Gad andDerek Jacobi get their moments in the spotlight under Kenneth Branagh'sdirection respectively. Nevertheless a too-close received screenplay byMichael Green comes at no time into nerve-striking regions of anhigh-octane mystery-thriller as should have been for ansuspense-undermining decade of the 2010s. That the picture has becomemotion picture entertainment despite all missed-out opportunities ofinnovative transcended story twists and a sensual acceleration is alonedue to the professionalism of all previously mentioned actors involved,who as the director shared a deep comprehension of classicmovie-making.FAZIT: Picture rejected (supenseless)© 2017 Felix Alexander Dausend (Cinemajesty Entertainments LLC)
