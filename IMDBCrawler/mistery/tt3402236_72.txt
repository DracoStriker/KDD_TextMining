"Murder on the Orient Express" is an enjoyable movie experience. Thefilm has some pacing issues, is very predictable for those that hadn'tseen the original or read the book, and the ending just kinda comes outof nowhere. Besides the flaws, I had a fun time watching this movie anddeciphering who the killer was myself. It is not a perfect movie but anenjoyable one.
