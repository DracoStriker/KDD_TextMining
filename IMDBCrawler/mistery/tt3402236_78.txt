I went into Murder on the Orient Express pretty cynically. AnotherHollywood remake. Another Kenneth Branagh costume drama. Another packedcast getting mediocre reviews. I thought, at best, it would be anempty, simple and silly little way to kill an afternoon. I wasbasically right?but through the high-pitched performances, twistingmystery and loving direction, this captivating yarn slowly but surelyoverwhelmed my doubts and won me over. Master and enigmatic DetectiveHercule Poirot is sucked into a job while on vacation, wherein a man onhis train has been murdered, and one of the other passengers is themurderer. The cast is chockfull of talent, which lends to theaction-packed fun; not "action-packed" like a Marvel flick, but more inthe puzzlement, patter and performances. It's wonderfully old-fashionedin that and so many other ways: the regal look; the wry, almost poeticdialogue ("There was right, there was wrong, and now there is you");the Shakespearean melodrama. The only thing I wish is Branagh and thestudio would've shot it all, not just the flashbacks, inblack-and-white, to really give it that classic, larger-than-lifehutzpah. Now before you think I'm blind to its faults, let me reassureyou. The cinematography, while often beautiful, is just as oftenobnoxious. The CGI train and scenery shots are jarringly cartoonish.The final explanation to the whodunit is more than a bit convoluted.However, the power and fun Branagh imbues in his films and actors makethis a train trip I would love to take myself again and again?thoughonly in movie form. The murder might not be as fun in real life.
