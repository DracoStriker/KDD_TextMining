For a remake it was not bad at all. in fact it was enjoyable....apassable remake which could been a lot better as it was kinda boring attimes until the assassination took place somewhat in the middle of themovie but the movie takes the average grade easily.the real money came at the end of the movie.last 20 minutes were the best and the song called justice from doylewas one of the best music score u ever heard.it reminds me another similar melody from the past but I can't rememberwhich one.this melody is divine.it's worth to buy the cd only for this song.overall a worthy remake but nothing we never watched before.there is a twist if u remember what happened to the 1974 movie but Ileave that to see it for yourself.Grade // c+
