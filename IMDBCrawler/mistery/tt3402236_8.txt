Difficult Kenneth Branagh makes, produces, and stars in good movies,and this version of Murder on the Orient Express features impressivesets, beautiful scenery, and lovely period clothes. An impressive casefeatures Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer,Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, and Kennth Branagh as Hercule Poirot. I thinkthose who are not familiar with Agatha Christie, Poirot, or the storymay very well like this movie.I, on the other hand, was massively disappointed, especially by Branaghas a sort of English upper-class colonel with a stick-on cavalrymoustache and by the needless addition of an introductory scene at theWailing Wall. But I am prejudiced. I read the 1934 novel decades agoand again more recently. I liked the 1974 star-studded version withLauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, JohnGielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, RichardWidmark, and Michael York?despite the fact that Albert Finney was avery poor version of Christie's Hercule Poirot. In my opinion, the 2010 television version of the story starred DavidSuchet as the definitive Poirot, and the ending was far and away thebest of all the versions with which I am familiar. So I think Christiefans may want to skip this edition of the classic.
