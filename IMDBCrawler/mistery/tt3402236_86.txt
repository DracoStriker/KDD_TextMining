I am a big fan of the 1974 version with Albert Finney as Poirot anddirected by Sydney Lumet. I read that Sir Kenneth Branagh wanted to doa fresh version with a different take so he deliberately did not viewthe 1974 film. His Poirot is a bit sweeter and more sentimental thanthe one written for, and acted by, Finney. However, I find him veryconvincing! There are touches of humor, especially in the first half ofthe film. The second half is more serious as Poirot realizes he mustsolve the crime and has limited time to do so. The cast was excellent, and the scenery whether real or CGI wasbeautiful. The opulence and grandeur of this kind of train travel inthe 1930s came across vividly. If anything, these characters are a bitmore touching, a bit less campy and "over the top" than the charactersin Lumet's film. That's not a bad thing, it is just a differentapproach. Even at the end, Poirot displays a little unintentional humorbecause with his perfectionism, he cannot help himself. It is a very enjoyable film, and Branagh is a fine actor, always. Hemakes the film work. That and the sight of alps at sunset!
