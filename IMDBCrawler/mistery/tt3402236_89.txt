Please excuse my EnglishI read with a lot of pleasure A C since i was a teenager , I enjoyedthe first version with such a charismatic casting and a mysteriousatmosphere that respected A C s universe . Alas this film is disappointing. First of all , the opening inJerusalem is disturbing ,ridiculous and -déplacé- The end is sotheatrical , so melodramatic that one seems to attend a Shakespeariantragedy.The choice of K B (that i admire ) is surprising. Tall , blond ,energetic , so -séduisant- , so different from the famous detective!As for the casting ,very mediocre except for M P , always beautiful andsensitive.Nevertheless , i noticed that youngsters in the audience applauded atthe end ...I confess that I suggested the film to my son who is 35 .May be the positive impact of the movie is to encourage people todiscover and read A C .But , please -cher- K B don t do a remake of Murder on the Nile as yousuggested since i won t see it - Désolé -
