As with any film centered around a mystery, there's a thrill infollowing the evidence, trying to figure out the whodunit and the how.If you go back to it afterward, you may find a new tidbit here orthere, but the original thrill is gone.Such is the case with the latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel.This is a beautiful film to look at, as are many modern films, and itis fun to immerse into the period of the 1930s, especially the detailsof the crime (which revolve around a case that is based on the real-life murder of Charles Lindbergh's baby in 1932), and the mystique ofthe Orient Express, for as one character muses, how fascinating it isto see a group of people with nothing in common but the shared need togo from one place to another, forced together, never to see each otheragain.The characters, too, are interesting portraits of the many types ofpersonas familiar to the era, with the most stereotyped personified indirector Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of detective Hercules Poirot. Likethe critically acclaimed 1974 adaptation of Christie's novel, this filmassembles an all-star cast to fill the roles of murder suspects,including Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Judy Dench, Josh Gad, WillemDafoe, and more.The film expertly weaves the tapestry of the crime and the many, manyred herrings that are left by the murderer, as well as Poirot'sattempts to establish a motive to explain the crime. At each turn hefinds links, but something eludes him until the grand reveal at theend.However, it's that grand reveal where the film can feel a bitlackluster, especially if one already knows how the story ends, for asbest as I can tell, this film does not add an new twists or surprisesto the original Christie story, and when the reveal finally happens,not only does it feel somewhat underwhelming because it seemedperfectly obvious all along, but the motivations is played without asufficient amount of weight.That's not to say that the reveal wouldn't be powerful to someoneunfamiliar with the particulars of the story, but for someone who is,this film's replay value is essentially nil.However, this film's brilliant performances and dry wit throughoutmakes this film enjoyable for anyone with a taste for mystery andwonderful theater, for this film feels more like a traditional playthan a film, and it's the better for it.
