Kenneth Branagh has created one of the most unforgettable HerculePoirots imaginable, far more impressive than the other film versions,in my opinion. It is a unique pleasure to spend time with thisexacting, world weary man. And unlike some of the other critics, Iadmire the man's over- the-top mustache which is an ambitious, ifcrazy, work of peerless face art!About two-thirds of the way through, I finally remembered who did it,but this production is done so well, I didn't really care. Far morethan the other renditions, this movie places you in the action verysuccessfully on the Orient Express in a snow storm with an engaginggroup of people ranging from the always formidable Judi Dench to asleazy Johnny Depp to a captivating Michelle Pfeiffer to an annoyingWillem Dafoe, and much more. The whole thing made far more sense thanthe other versions.I think this film deserves multiple rewards and I highly recommend!
