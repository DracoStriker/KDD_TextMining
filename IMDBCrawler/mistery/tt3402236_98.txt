Simply put, a perfect conclusion to an excellent evening.I'm a huge fan of the tradition of "dinner and a movie". A good dinnercan be easily found. A great movie is a bit harder to predict. Murderon the Orient Express is one of those movies in which you can beentertained, saddened, surprised, and unable to avoid discussionafterwards through many conversations.Kenneth Branagh and the accompanying eclectic troop have accomplishedsomething extraordinarily difficult. For 2+ hours, I was not watchingactors and sets, I was experiencing characters and locations. It feltlike I was on the train. It felt a bit claustrophobic. It feltdangerous. It felt like there were so many lies it was hard to knowwhich piece of evidence or statement was a fact. And it felt fun!I saw the first incarnation of this movie about 10 years after itsinitial release when I was 15. I then read the book. It made bothbetter as I could "see" the story that much clearer. Watching thisretelling has again spurred my interest into a genre which clearlyneeds even more additions.One can only hope that Death on the Nile is around the corner.Suggestion: make it a date night, see the early viewing, and then gosomewhere with background music and have a wonderful chat with someonewhose company you deeply enjoy. It's that good.
