This film is s disgrace to the franchise, I really want my moneyback!!!FiretrUCK you Matt Reeves!this film should be called "FAILED INFILTRATION MISSION FOR THE PLANETOF THE APES" or "PRISONER OF THE WAR THAT NEVER HAPPENED IN THE PLANETOF THE APES" or "NO WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES"With Ceasar and his apes in a cave, which is stupid, he should be amilitary commander with generals and ape soldiers, don't make them wantto live in harmony with nature. The apes are smarter now. they shouldwant to at least share the planet andfight for it, don't start them outto be weak and isolated primates with no clothes after what happen inDawn.The apes get attacked by the Colonel where we no nothing about him.which we get a glimpse later which makes little sense why he wants towipe out all the apes.Where are the people like PETA that actually like the apes and supporttheir right to exist?Then 4 apes go on a infiltration mission, no full scale war. which mostget captured anyway except for Murrice and a little girl no one caresabout.The whole movie I could have watched at the zoo because it is just hasapes in cages nearly the whole film.Then the final showdown is muted Colonel who shoots himself. Mostboring f***ing film I have seen in a long time.The writers would find a new day job!
