Oh I tried to ignore the propaganda, I really did, the first two filmsof this trilogy are very good films (and not in a back handed "for asummer blockbuster" sort of compliment), but this is an awful 150million misstep. This is my 2nd review ever and I don't review thingsunless they particularly rub me the wrong way.I'll be spelling certain words wrong to get around word gagging orderson IMDb.War of the Planet of the Apes literally beats you over the head withthis defecation of the human spirit, I'm in awe of how blatantlyforward it is and I love good sci-fi commentary. (Battlestar Galacticaand The Wire are some of my favorite pieces of fiction)Here in this script we have no sympathy for Harrelson's and humanity'sunderstandable dilemma as to how to beat a virus that is causing humansto lose their speech and higher faculties. They don't even have theballs to have the apes wipe out what's left of the human army as thatwould make the apes even more obviously terrible than they already are;so they have a natural disaster do the job. The blond girl/child thatthey carry with them goes to live with the apes, dumb(from the virus)but happy.......and humanity's downfall is complete. Even though exaltthe child's beauty early in the film! But what is beauty without brainsultimately?What great moral lesson was I supposed to glean? That humans are soterrible that we should walk quietly into the night? Oh look the apesare thick.....but some of them are funny Totally worth it!Conversations and plot points are so monosyllabic that it was almostorgasmic when Woody Harrelson turned up to speak more than than the fewgrunts that we hear up to this point and FINALLY gives us a reason tocare.Bonus points for cultural maxisms (spelled wrong to get aroundcensorship) is when the blond child cries over the ape who is killedthat she has known for all of two scenes but doesn't even flinch whenher father is killed by said group of apes.Go out to the beach with your kids, hell even go the beach or lake byyourself, hell go further, go out when its raining and make somememories.Also I'm not the slightest bit Christian and I can see this picture isblatantly not only anti-Christian but to the non religious out there aswell its this......anti human, anti intelligence
