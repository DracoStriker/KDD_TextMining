If you've not seen War of the Planet of Apes, here's a Warning: THEREIS NO WAR IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! What exist are just skirmishes between humans and the imprisoned apeswho were trying to escape.In fact, it is a FLOP movie! Only 15 people were watching the show.The first 75% of the movie is very, very slow and the movie is 30minutes too long (actual length is 2hr 20 mins). This is because thestory-writer hopelessly failed to think of ways to add Thrill and areal War ? but, instead, made the plot move at a snails' pace just toelongate the movie time.In fact, this film could easily have finished in 1 hr and 30 minutes.Not a second more.The movie ends in an "unconvincing" manner: One military faction iseliminated by another military group. And this group is eliminated by aroaring Avalanche. This helps the apes to escape to the dessert theywere planning to relocate on.NOTE: The Avalanche was created because the story-writer could notthink of a way for the apes to attack and defeat the military faction.How Convenient! LOL! The only great thing about this movie is the CGI which makes the apeslook 100% realistic. The Avalanche too looks realistic. The visuals andcinematography is great.WPA is an extremely "unconvincing" end to a trilogy whose first 2episodes are just Moving & Thrilling ? which touched your heart andmind. They made you feel for each of the characters.I feel like giving TIGHT SLAPS across the faces of Writers Matt Reevesand Mark Bomback, just as I felt like giving the same to RolandEmmerich for Independence Day 2.
