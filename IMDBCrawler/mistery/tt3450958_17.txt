a) The most deceptive movie title there is. It tries to hype you up byadding an epic feeling, but the movie was nothing but garbage. Heck,there wasn't a war, a battle, or even combat.b) Characters we can't relate to, the portrayal of the characters waseven worse.c) Can someone tell me what the purpose or meaning of this movie was?I'm having trouble finding one.d) Nothing good about this movie. No action, hardly any story line, nomeaning...please don't waste time and money watching this d) I'm goingto go to the zoo, film some apes jumping around, and call it "War forthe Planet of the Apes". Anyone interested in seeing it?
