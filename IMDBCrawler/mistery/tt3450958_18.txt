I really liked the 1st movie and enjoyed the 2nd so figured the 3rdwould be a good ending except they forgot to write a story. This filmis 140 minutes long -- with at least 45 minutes too many of apecloseups, or should I say CGI closeups. The sad thing is they couldhave soared with the 3rd installment but instead made a $150 milliondud. Soldiers with modern lethal weapons against apes with spears -just crazy. And the moral of the story, well there really wasn't oneexcept all the human soldiers good and bad got killed while a remnantof apes survived along with a mysterious young girl who joined theapes. I think I would have preferred something where the conflict risesto a crescendo and then ends with a fragile peace with apes and humanslearning to live together, not separate. Alas, the "authors" decidedthat apes and humans can't live together. Let's hope there is neveranother plant of the apes, ever.
