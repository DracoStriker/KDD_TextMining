To start, this is the first movie I've ever reviewed. After seeing thismovie I felt the need to get my opinion out. So, what a long journey from the city of Misstreadedville with a finaldestination at Depressingland it was. You're telling me it's not enoughthat he is running for his life to save his people (depressing). Hiswife and one kid get killed (even more depressing). But wait, there'smore, he and his people become slaves (thanks for reminding me aboutthe worst tragedy in the history of the world). So here's our chance for an awesome battle with good apes and goodhumans. Epic action to see Caesar be his hardcore self, right? Nope. Wesee him battle no one and get shot by the person he spared. What anopportunity for mercy to be given back. So that's it right? Wrong again. We see super smart Caesar, not plughis wound and travel through the desert bleeding out. As a father hemust have some small attachment to his soon to be orphan kid right.Wrong again.So finally we arrive at Depressingland. To say I demand analternate/extended ending is an understatement. Please fix this.
