I don't often write reviews, but this was the first movie I walked outon in a long time. I really liked the first two movies in this trilogy, but this movie wasso bad. The story is so cliché and has been told 100 times over. Thedirecting was horrible and most of the music and dialog was so cheesy.They even threw in a Jar Jar Binks character for some cringe worthycomic relief. There was no reason given for the plot and there was no reason to careabout Caesar or the apes. Having to listen to a bunch of apes squawklike 2 year old children while reading subtitles the entire movie wasjust the needle that finally broke this camels back. I want the two hours of my life I wasted on this back!
