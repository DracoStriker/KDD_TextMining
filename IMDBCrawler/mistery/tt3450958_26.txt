The first movie was good. The second was not as good, but still OK. Butthis third movie is shiiiiiiite.How can a movie like this be made? Why are the writers insulting theintelligence of the audience? Looks like the writers had their infantkids write this movie for them.But then the movie has a rating of 8/10 at IMDb. So maybe the plot ofthe movie is partly correct. Maybe humans are all turning intoretards...Final assessment: boring and cheesy. Rating: 2/10 for some quality CGI.
