This is the first time in my life that I walked out of the cinemawithin 5 minutes after the movie started (I have done it before oncebut it was an awful cliché typical Chinese commercial movie and eventhat I survived for nearly half an hour). The start of this movie isterrible with several scenes of pure words shown to inform the audienceof the story background. Why don't you just tell the whole story likethis with some music at the back? It would have been more productive. Ididn't hold up my hope in the first beginning, but it literally reachedthe lowest when the lines, acting and plot are so predictable,superficial and mind-numbing. Nothing in this movie, well the firstfive minutes of the movie, is indicating something in-depth. I wasshocked and appalled to see it has a high rating. I would rather wastemy money for the ticket than sitting there for two hours and get mymind poisoned. It makes me feel sick that people actually make this.
