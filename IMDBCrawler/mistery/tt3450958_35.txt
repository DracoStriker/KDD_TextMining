OK, first the good.- CGIThey were really proud of making the monkeys - sorry, apes! - look goodin CGI.- The beginningGot a Vietnam-vibe going on with the beginning of the movie, and the"Donkeys" felt like South Vietnamese fighting the Vietcong. Ended after10-15 minutes.Now the bad- The storyThere was no story. They were captured, they escaped, the end. Ceasarwanted to get revenge, decided not to since the "Colonel" who killedhis wife and son was broken anyway from "muteness"-virus. They left.- The "war"There was a conflict going on in the background, but that's pretty muchit. Like the apes stumbled on to something we have no idea about. Thisis a non-existing story.- Deus ex machinaSince the Colonel's army lost (the colonel committed suicide) after 5minutes of battle, the "enemies" had to be dealt with somehow. I know!Avalanche kills them all! THE END!The movie has no story, no character development, nothing. Without theother two movies we wouldn't know why Ceasar was the hero of the movieat all.There is no movie here. No movie at all.THE ENDMeh?
