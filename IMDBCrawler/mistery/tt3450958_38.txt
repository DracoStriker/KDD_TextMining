Saw it on opening night.My Girlfriend - An important prequel to the Charleton Heston "Planet ofthe Apes". Explains so much in the original. Fabulous special effects.Loved it.Me - Some really corny stock lines to show apes have feelings too.Action shots that probably look way better in 3D. The ending isreminiscent of Moses crossing the Red Sea.Idle thought while waiting for something to happen in the movie - theapes are nowhere near anatomically correct. But then it would have hadto get an R rating instead of PG-13.I was left distinctly underwhelmed.I suspect the small audience that barely filled 20% of the theater wastoo.
