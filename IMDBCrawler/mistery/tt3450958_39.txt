This has been the first time I've been compelled to write an IMDbreview. This movie should have about 6 stars and hopefully will beforeall is done. There is very little war with the Humans, the actual fight scenes arefull of glaring plot holes. Apparently our army cannot locate and fighta bunch of tribal apes despite having access to all the technology youwould expect. I really wanted to see a more evolved Ape civilization,but they are almost taken backwards to create sympathy. This leaves themovie being a more political movie.I should have watched Spiderman this weekend.
