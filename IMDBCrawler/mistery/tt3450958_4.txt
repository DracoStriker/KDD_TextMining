I am astonished, truly, that a hollow movie like spider-man; homecomingthat is instantly forgettable and fixated on lame themes of stupidfirst-world teenage angst scored better user reviews than thismasterpiece. it really says a lot about the mindlessness of moderncinema audiences, especially when the main argument is that ' thereisn't enough war'. that said, user reviews are moronic. Planet of theapes is a triumph, really touching and thought, provoking on so manylevels. i saw it days ago and the emotion of the film is still veryfresh in my mind. in fact the more it occurs to me, the richer themovie becomes. if this is not nominated in the best film Oscarscategory, then the Academy is as daft as so many IMDb users.
