This is a complete let down!! The first movie was the best and thesecond felt like a war movie which was great and full of action.This 3rd entry is slow from the beginning and seems like it willdeliver an epic showdown but never does. Woody Harrelson's Character iswasted. Such a shame. Where's the action, seriously the second entrywas packed full of action, this unfortunately is waste of time. Itslike recycled scenes from other movies that have depicted slavery.Nothing great. The only good thing in this movie I found was thecomedic relief, he was fun. But that's all. 1/10. Waste
