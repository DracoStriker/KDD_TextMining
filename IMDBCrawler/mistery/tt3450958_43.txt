I loved the first movie. Second movie was good. This third movie wasawful. Why? PLOT CONVENIENCES GALORE Examples: a) Group wants to rescue Caesar but don't know how to get into thefacility. At that very second, one of them accidentally falls through ahole in the ground and into a sewer system which conveniently leadsthem into the facility.b) The apes make their move to escape from the facility which isoccupied with hundreds of soldiers and guards. They only had to takedown the one guard who was responsible for watching hundreds of theapes.c) Caesar is about to get shot by the opposing army -- An avalanchecomes down on them at that very second.d) Caesar and his clan finally arrive at their new home -- Caesar diesright on the spot and becomes a martyr. I understand they want toelevate Caesar's greatness with him dying but he went from looking okayafter miles of walking to being dead within a minute (all due to awound that was never patched up for some reason) There are many more of these. I'm not asking for 100% realisticscenarios, otherwise there would be no movie but this movie was full oflazy writing. Ceasar is a great character but his presence alone cannotcarry this movie. There is also the issue of the extremely bad pacingand character inconsistencies (like the girl who wept for a dead apeshe only knew for a day but was alright seeing her father dead on theground)
