The first two movies begin with the slow pacing that were eventually toled to this finale. Turns out, it's the worst in the series, continuingthe pattern of being 'the third and the turd' of the trilogy moviefranchises. The movie and its fans pretend like it's something not ofwar, but of a greater story based adventure, which it definitely isnot. The first and second movie, more importantly, second movie'sending, led us to believe that this movie will have the ultimatepromised war that was looming since the ending of the first movie. Thismovie does far less than deliver the promise. It's not called beingshallow to expect war from a movie like this, instead we got is slowpaced movie with terribly clichéd ending.
