This movie was beyond boring. It was also very pretentious. There wereso many plot holes in this film. Way more plot holes than Dawn of thePlanet of the Apes. The cinematography was very mediocre. It's the samebland, darkly lit look from the previous Dawn of the Planet of the Apesfilm. Camera placement wasn't very good and it had no use of thequadrant system when it came to framing either. The CGI is probably thebest it's ever been, but it's nothing special. It's just a bunch oftalking apes riding horses and shooting machine guns with one arm. Thedirection had no style, it had weak action sequences that were verystupid with very little inventive camera work. The OST composed byMichael Giacchino might be one of the most laziest OST I have everheard. It tries to be deep and biblical, but it just ends up beinglaughable. This is one of the worst films of the year and probably oneof the worst films I have ever seen. Highly overrated.0/10.
