Drama and special effects with an incoherent story line and caricaturesinstead of characters. This could have been a good movie but has gonebeyond credibility to the point of absurdity. Where are the technicaladviser? Did anyone think to consult one soldier about protocol?Especially after watching the originals, this does not even comparewith Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Summation: White man pure evil, ape and stupid human good.
