I'm not sure what the intention was behind this movie but from start tofinished I was disappointed. I don't think I've posted a review ever onIMDb but this movie was so bad I felt a need to be a voice of reason.As an audience, we are coming into this movie already aware of thesituation. Instead we are presented with a CinemaSin cliché almostimmediately with the wonderful use of explaining the previous twomovies in two paragraphs. Based on the trailers the audience is misled into believing that thereis going to be a "war" that happens at some point. What we arepresented with is Jerry Horne esque character that the audience is justsupposed to believe is now an integral part of the story.There was nothing redeeming about this movie.
