This has to be humanity's low point. Not the movie, the people givingit glowing reviews. What a mindless crowd of 'bots parroting paidcommercial hype about something that has NO STORY, NO WAR and NOPURPOSE other than making money off of total morons. The way peoplemindlessly react to marketing cues like trained poodles is disturbingin the extreme. Could be useful as a first date movie or a new friend that you're notreally sure about. Anyone that thinks this is a great movie is notworth associating with beyond what it takes for you to drive them homeafter the movie.It's almost like English panto. The play isn't funny, everyone knowswhat will happen, and the audience reacts on cue with as stereotypicaldialogue as the actors. Seriously, targeted at gen Y? Have millennialsactually been raised to react like little 'bots to particularcommercial stimuli? I fear so, for there is no other reason thatsomeone would rave about this kind of big budget, Hollyweird CRAP!And they need to be sued. The screen writing is so lazy as to be non-existent, and when they do come up with a character...it's a completerip-off of Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. I can just hear the banter amongthe makers of this one. "Uh...he's a total rip-off of Kurtz." "Yeah,but just stick a goatee on him and it'll be OK".And did I mention that it was boring to the point of torture? Slow?It's stops more often than a school bus, whilst running twice as slow.Even if you're totally marketing addled and wouldn't mind this, youwill mind what you pay to see it. It's simply not worth it at anyprice. Free. If it were free and you're mindless...maybe. Otherwise,forget it!
