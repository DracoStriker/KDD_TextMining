Shocking. Absolutely shocking.It's rare that I've actually wanted to leave a film before it ends. Thewriters tried to pull the wool over our eyes and recycle scenes frommultiple classics such as Schindler's List, Lord of the Rings andArrival staring Jeremy Renner. Every emotional scene with that annoying piano score made me want togouge my eyes out. In comparison, the masterful aerial shots of DenisVilleneuve's 2016 blockbuster Arrival were mesmerising and visuallyrich. 1 out of 10 (And that's generous).Ron
