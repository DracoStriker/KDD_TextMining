I write this review in the hopes of stopping people wasting their timeand money on this terrible movie. It was boring, cliché, predictable and drawn out to the point that Iwas hoping for it to end. I have no idea how this movie got such a high score and it honestlymakes me suspicious. I was with two other people who agreed that thiswas one of the worst movies they had ever seen.
