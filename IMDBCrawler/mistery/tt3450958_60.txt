You know, the first movies were fantastic. This onE is just ORDINARYbut worse, clichéd ordinary!!! Actually, I'll call this movie badmediocre.You keep hoping for the first one and a quarter hours that somethingspecial will reveal itself but don't worry, it won't, you can restassured that if you find yourself yawning, scratching, hoping it willend soon, that it won't do that either... it just goes on and on and onin dark, broody, miserable, depressing, nothingness with a bad dialogueto match.And the thing about the little girl... the apes kill her father butthat doesn't seem to sink in... actually, this movie is just plainstupid, filled with silly blunders and ordinary acting. How the heck,after the brilliance of the other movies, did they get this one sowrong? And there's no war. Just a dark, broody mess and lots of bloodand dead things. Save your money. Spend on a coffee or a cuppa tea andcake.The only reason I rated it as high as 4 is because I have always likedCesar so much and the lovey big orange guy who talks to him.
