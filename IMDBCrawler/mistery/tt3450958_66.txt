After the first 2 movies expectations were high, unfortunately thisweak sadly non story episode is beyond the pale.There is no engagement with the characters, no real plot, no good guyin the human side, no mitigation of characters. Basically apes are good attacked and abused by warlike humans andeventually escape and make good. That's it. Throw in a bunch ofillogical mumbo jumbo about the virus and motives (if any) amongst thebad guys and away they go.What a crock......
