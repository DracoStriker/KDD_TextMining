Anybody who thinks that the left doesn't influence movie content shouldconsider this ridicules film. Here the bad guys are the American army,this is made apparent in a scene where all the poor lovable apes arejailed and starved in a large area with an American flag is on display,and just to get the point across the Star Spangled Banner is played.The chief badest of the bad guys is The Colonel, and just to put theliberal icing on the hate cake they show a Christian cross in hisquarters. We certainly don't want to show the bad guys as those whoslam passenger jets into buildings, or who behead anyone who doesn'tadhere to their brand of religion, or stone women to death who commitadultery, or drive trucks into innocent pedestrians in Europe. No,don't show them as bad guys, that would be politically incorrect andmight hurt their feelings, the radical left movie makers would neverallow it.
