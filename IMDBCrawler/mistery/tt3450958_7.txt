Pierre Boulle the French novelist wrote Planet of the Apes (OriginallyThe Monkey Planet). A classic SF novel. In 1968 it was filmed and sostarted the cinematic journey which leads to this. I watched Battle forthe Planet of the apes as a young man. I thought that this movie wasgoing to be along the same lines as that movie. After all, all of thetrailers pitch it as a war between the apes and man. I was reallylooking forward to it. I liked the last two movies. They were not asgood as the original series but were still interesting SF movies intheir own right. Also, everything has been better than the Tim BurtonPlanet of the apes.So I put on my 3d glasses and sat down in Wood Green London to watchthe war that would change the face of the planet. So there is a briefskirmish. Then the head ape Corny (as the plot is) sets out to findthose responsible for doing wrong to him (yawn). Bring on the WAR Ithought. Then they ride around for a bit. Next, we get Escape fromColditz, the great escape or Prison Break. I am still waiting for thepromised war. At that end, there is a battle. Not against the apes asthey are all escaping. Though unfortunately none of them get on amotorcycle and try to jump over barriers.I walked out of the cinema and thought what a pile of dung.The 3d is pathetic. Really this is a movie that could have been good in3d but wasn't. It is at least 40 minutes too long. Also, it is not themovie they promised. There are no wars in it. It is littered withmistakes. My favourite is the 350-pound gorilla on a horse. No, thathorse would have been dead.Lastly and this is my normal grump. Why did it not say it was based onPlanet of the apes by Pierre Boulle? No mention of him in thisshamefully bad movie.I really wanted to like this movie. What I got was a movie thatsurpassed Burton's POTA's for the worst one in the series.
