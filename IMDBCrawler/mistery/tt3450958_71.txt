This movie is good. It shows how much greedy and animals humans are.The apes were human and not just like us but fully human. Caeser onlycared for his pride, and family. For us it shows how much we don't careif we make others suffers and the greed to rule is madness. I like badape he made the movie not about action he showed we can laugh in toughsituations because if you are always serious you'll never thinkpositive. Marcie shows the kindness and caring of what humans don'thave. Donkey showed even being selfish to your own kind is pain andmeaningless. We should never be against our own but doesn't mean goagainst others. Ceaser only wanted to be in peace to live the life WillRodman gave him. But humans will always think the worst of a differentkind that has the same advancement as a enemy. Its not wrong to thinkthe worst but should we take action when they knew Caeser shows mercy?
