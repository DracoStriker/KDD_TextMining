I am literally astonished of the reviews and ratings of thismasterpiece . I am sad to see so many people in here rate this movie asbad and write a awful reviews about a movie that should at leastcompete for the best film Oscars category of this year in my opinion.Planet of the apes is a triumph, really touching on so many levels. Theemotions of this film are better than I have ever seen in any moviebefore .
