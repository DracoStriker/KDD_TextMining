Visuals are absolutely stunning. Period. I can't write too much aboutit because the movie looks great!Too bad that the story is stunningly stupid, though. I am a big fan ofthe first two parts of this sequel and I had high expectations againstthe final episode as well.Without going into all the details you will face: - Ceasar who's unableto understand the concept of war - a little girl who became instantfriends of the apes, no matter that she was probably raised tohate/fear the apes and the monkeys just killed his father 5 minutes ago- a supposedly high security military camp where this girl could justwalk in without anybody seeing her - a supposedly high securitymilitary camp which has unguarded, not exploded pipelines underneathwhere anybody can simply walk in - a supposedly high security militarycamp with ground thick as 10in so anybody can just dig up fromunderneath - evil Colonel building a completely useless wall - Jar JarBinks of the apes. Thats on its own deserves a face punch! - a trainwagon full of gasoline capable to destroy the entire military base. -Ridiculous distances traveled in minutes (from sunny, probably warmbeach to snowstorm) - Ceasar got an arrow shot in the final battle.Then he travels with his tribe thru deserts and lands which should takeat least a year. Once they arrived to a lake they will call "home",Ceasar dies from the bleeding arrow shot... stupid! That would havekilled him in days if not hours.and so on, and so on.These "little" things completely ruined the movie for me and I onlystayed because my girlfriend refused to walk out. At the end sheadmitted that it was a mistake.
