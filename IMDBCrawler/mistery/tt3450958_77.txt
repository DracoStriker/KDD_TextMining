Being a huge fan of the modern planet of the apes franchise I wasextremely disappointed in this one, first off the title is "war for theplanet of the apes" so I was expecting at least a little more war butall you get is a a beginning maybe 10 min of what I guess some woulddescribe as war where plot kind of gets set up but it felt rushed, likethey were in a hurry to set up the plot, then you get an hour of justfiller where nothing is really going on, nothing to keep the viewerentertained or at least a little interested then the ending, don't evenget me started in the ending, awful ending where they were clearlysetting the stage for a new beginning where his son is going tocontinue on with Caesar legacy, the whole Movie from beginning to endjust felt rushed, like the writers were in a hurry to get the viewerthrough it as quickly as possible just to set it up for the next movieand through woody Harrelson to attract more of an audience, the last 2didn't even need any star power to be entertaining, this one justfailed miserably in every aspect and am vert disappointed, this was theone and only remake franchise that Hollywood didn't seem to slaughterand now that's gone, if you're goal is to be lazy, unimaginative,greedy Hollywood you get an A+ unfortunately that's not what you shouldbe going for
