Unsurprisingly the third part in this second reboot of the franchisewas one of the big films this summer. In being so, it has it deliver inthe scale of a blockbuster and in this way it certainly does. The jumpsin technology over just the last decade is there on the screen to beseen, and it is consistently impressive regardless of the specifics ofthe shot. The large battle sequences and wide shots are the obviousexamples, but in the close-up and expressions of the main characters iswhere you will be most impressed with what is possible now.The scale of the technology is one thing, but the other element is thescale of the story. On one hand it is expansive, but on the other itmakes it a personal and small in its focus on the two mainprotagonists. This allows a lot of internal drama to play out,particularly in Caesar. Mostly this works well enough to support theblockbuster and stop it feeling like an expensive video game, but thatis not to say that it always manages to make it work. There isconflict, inner turmoil, and some character, but it doesn't transformthe film or elevate it significantly above the level of still being apretty function (and good) blockbuster. Within the writing there isstill a lot of convenience, a lot of artificial construction, and manyfairly obvious narrative arcs. They all engage and do the job, but theydon't stand up to reflection or turn the film into something smarter ordeeper. The ending, meanwhile, feels dropped in from a totallydifferent film, but yet obvious and clunky at the same time.As a blockbuster, it has plenty to enjoy and to make it stand out fromthe pack, but at the same time the epic scale doesn't justify thelength, and the content is not as sharp or engaging as it suggests.
