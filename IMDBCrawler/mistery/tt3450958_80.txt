This movie reminds me of really bad fantasy B-movies from the 80s and90s ? you know when the mere fact that the movie had fantasticalelements made you watch it no matter how bad it was? Those movies hadpaper thin plots with a lot of moronic plot holes, badly written dialogand almost no action because that was expensive to shoot. They had somelimited special effects, were shot in the wilderness with a limitedcast and one or two scenes with a lot of extras that they splashed mostof their cash on. Everything about this movie is like that except offcourse it's not cheap and the effects are superb. Odd that it turnedout this way since the other two movies in the series are legitimatelygood. I could have enjoyed this for what it was it if had any businessbeing this bad, but it really hasn't. And besides: fantasy and sci-fimovies are made a lot more frequently and at a much better qualitytoday. We can afford to be a bit more picky than we were 20 years ago.
