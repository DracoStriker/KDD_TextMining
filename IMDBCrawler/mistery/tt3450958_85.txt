This installment in the series felt like a mixture of Schindlers List,Star Wars, The Great Escape and the previous Planet Of The Apesinstallments. It was about leadership, ensuring the future generationswell-being, family, revenge, cowards, traitors, friendship, espionage,escape, slavery and so on. The list of the themes that are present inthis movie is pretty impressive for such a "short" film.Also the execution is beautiful. The visuals are, as expected,astonishing! The sets, the cinematography, the motion-capture & acting,the CGI and even the editing (letting the characters breathe andthink)...all of it is brilliant. I was in awe how real the apesactually looked. In some cases I was even sure that they used practicalapes and masks. The CGI was THAT good. (I wonder how long it will taketo actually see believable CGI-humans though)My only issue with this movie is the fact that IT IS a movie. Everysituation and every consequence feels (to me) just a little tooimpact-less. It does not hit my feels the way it should. The mainreason for that is, in my opinion, the limited time we spend with allthe characters. I think it is a rare case where the movie would havebenefited by being an eight episodes long TV show. The additionalrunning time could be used to further explore the characters, thusmaking everything that happens to them more impactful.But that is just personal complaining on a high-level. The movie isgreat and I definitely recommend seeing it. It is for sure a well spentshort time.
