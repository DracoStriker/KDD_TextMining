I am not sure how anyone who enjoyed the first two movies in thistrilogy could be disappointed with "War for the Planet of the Apes". Ithas the same heart and soul and intelligence as the first two. Mr.Gerkis does another masterful turn portraying Caeser, the ape who ismore "human" than the humans who are all trying to exterminate him.Woody Harrelson is also a good choice as the mad colonel. I especiallyenjoyed the early scenes, which were shot amidst towering waterfallsand dark caves, as the humans tried to flush out the apes in theirwoods. The plot and story line are both first-rate science fictiondrama--it's all very believable that apes could someday rule theplanet.
