I could go over every single point, there were so many mistakes in theplot that was meant to be delivered, but even being uncertain, themelody of movie feels nice. I know what we all were expecting.Something great, something never done before (or new experiments).Something we all experienced while watching the first one. Maybe itsnot that but:Please do not let all commentary words discharge you from watching thisvery well made movie. Its obvious that tremendous work was delivered toshape it and its well worth a watch. Don't let obvious critics foolyou, but the same time, don't expect the tingle of the mind... Overall,great movie, but most likely will cause lots of debates.Despite somewhat negative review, giving 6.7+, very well deserved!
