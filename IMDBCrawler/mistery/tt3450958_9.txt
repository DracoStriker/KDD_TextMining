I should have read the reviews here before going to the theatre, wouldhave saved me the ticket, petrol, and parking.I must have dozed off at least four times and the plot has more holesthan a slice of Emmental cheese.No war whatsoever, nada, zero, zilch. Some guerrilla combat(?) and thatwas it. The only war I saw was me fighting to keep awake.Go read a book instead 1/10
