In the genre war drama countless movies were made with a commonmessage, war brings no good to anyone. War has always been taken as aweapon to show power, to create domination over the weak. Countlesslives are lost in the said process."War for the Planet of the apes" is made under the direction of MattReeves with the same tone as other war movies convey. With theinfluence of a accidentally created virus, Men are evolving into Apes.The remaining population of human beings seemed to have lost the basicquality "humanity". Instead, apes are appeared to have possess thesame. This is clear in a scene when apes are releasing the humanprisoners they looked shocked by the "humanity" shown to them and said"you are letting us go?"Like any other world war movies, concentration camp is shown here whereinstead of having human prisoners, apes are seen. The protagonistCaesar, played tremendously by relatively unknown face Andy Serkis,taking method acting at its high, making an escape plan with the helpof his group to free the prisoners. And the satisfying fact is thatultimately "humanity" wins.
