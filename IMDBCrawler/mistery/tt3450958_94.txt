I truly feel the pain inside me when I see so many negative reviewabout this movie on IMDb. Growing up watching the 2nd remake (2001, andall of them are bull dung), and later on watch the original (theoriginal are masterpieces), now I find this trilogy amazing. Peoplecomplain there is no "war". Oh cmon, this is not like call of duty war,or Destiny war, this is evolution war, this is mental war. It isserious on so many level that the movie doesn't talk about war is justpeople shoot people, people shoot apes or apes shoot ape, this is themovie about mental pain (ceaser's family is killed), PTSD (ceaser keepsseeing the ghost of Koba), and metal fight (ceaser keeps fighting backhis own will of revenge). This movie is touchy on so many level and themore I watch it, the more I feel fascinating about how the director canput so many content in just like 2h of watching. Truly masterpiece, inmy opinion, this movie deserve 7/10 for some rush action and plot hole,but I have vowed to give any ape movie 9/10 so here you go. Stop hatingand start loving the monkey.
