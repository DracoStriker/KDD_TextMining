Believe it or not, I debated for a long time as to whether or not I wasgoing to watch this. I found the original (in this genre's reboot) tobe better than the original, but found its sequel to be simply boring,overrated, and almost unwatchable. And then, there's the thirdinstallment.I cannot believe how involved I became in this film. I found thewriting, the story, the pace, the directing--everything--to be leapsand bounds above the other two films. The casting for this film wasperfect. What really blew me away, though, was the actual story.Everything is tied up and all questions answered in the third chapter.What's even more amazing is it all makes sense! When the film opens, the humans are trying to flush out Caesar and hisminions. After years of battle, it seems a certain faction of thehumans have found a Messiah; someone who will lead them to the retakingof their land. Known only as "The Colonel," and delightfully portrayedby Woody Harrellson, I cannot think of too many characters on film Ihave despised more. On his way in search of The Colonel, Caesar beginsto discover something may not be right in the community of humans.Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and torture, this is one of the bestfilms of this year. I highly recommend it.
