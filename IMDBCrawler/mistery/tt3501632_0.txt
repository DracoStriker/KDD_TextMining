Ragnarok is a neon-infused fantasy of what superhero films could looklike. There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armiesand a big spooky dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn'tjust a wacky movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is thechild of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thorfranchise could have always been.It takes a character that could have always been more and makes good onthat promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasmfor the world. This is exactly how we should be rewarded for theirfandom. There has never been a clearer example of throwing the entirekitchen sink at a single title and having every single washer andlug-nut of that porcelain mechanism land in perfect order thanRagnarok.
