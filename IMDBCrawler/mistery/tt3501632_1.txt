Real or not this movie is one hell of a journey! The story is trulyserious and great, the fun moments are tons! The cinematography ofaction scenes is just unrealistic good. Hela is one of the best MCUvillain so far! Cate Blanchett just killing in it in this role. Shelooks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is bigstep, thinking about previous Thor movies. Hulk got so many epicmoments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the ne"Revengers" team such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again!Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome. The movie it's so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch itagain and again and again! The score of the movie, the intense scenes,I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the threeThor movies. Firstly because it feels like whole new story telling, andsecondly it's also one of the best MCU movies. Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies,and like a die hard MARVEL fan I appreciate that.I will not reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want youto enjoy yourself first, but you'll not be disappointed at all! Hela isepic, Odin got his role in Ragnarok and there are some HUGE detailsthat'll lead to Infinity War and you'll lose your mind when you seethem. MINOR SPOILER: Someone is coming!
