First of all I wanna say,Hela is amazing.Best villain I ve ever seensince the Joker(Of course not the God awful joker from s.squad.Thejoker from dark knight)Action scenes were so incredible.Fenrir,Surtur,Hela,Sakaar,Hulk,Thor,Gladiator-battle arena,demolition of Asgard etc..so damn epic.I am gladthey put comedy on this last Thor movie cause the Thor 1 and 2 were allserious movies,especially Thor was a serious character.This didn't workout so they tried to make a funnier,more entertaining movie.In myopinion it was a great move.Cause there were so many emotional momentsand deaths in this movie.Btw,be ready for very surprising deaths and cameos.I didn't mind the comedy cause they put all the jokes in rightplaces.Just like they did in Guardians of the Galaxy,Ant man and FOXdid in Deadpool.Also I am not allergic to comedy or having fun if they make it right.Iam not one of those moody,goth/emo,depressing people with boring,dulllife.I am very satisfied with this movie.Now it is time for JUSTICE LEAGUE.Ireally hope that movie will be great too. I liked WONDER WOMAN alot,hope J.L will be as good as that.
