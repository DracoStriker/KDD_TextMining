The concept of Ragnarok for a Thor finale was unexpected and amazingespecially since the Norse myths on which the event is based on and thecomic arc is based on were great sources for this movie and I thinkTaika read exactly none of them.The whole grandiose Ragnarok was the 5minutes Surtur trashed Asgard.As for the characters:1)Thor:Had some development,learned to work together with people,trustin his power and the responsibility of a leader,after 3 movies he justlearned that.His attitude towards the whole situation was unnecessaryto be honest,most of the times he felt like he either didn't care orwas unaware of the real danger.I liked that for once he could stand hisown against Hela(for a while),defeated Hulk and the monsters in Helland Hela's army of the dead.I loved his version of Thorforce(his truepotential).2)Hulk/Banner:It finally gave the big guy some development,someconciseness,some feelings of his own,it was good to see him caring forhis friends and acting like a sentient being for once.It was refreshingto see the man and the beast coming at terms with their mutual need foreach other.I don't really understand yet why Banner would disappearforever if he ever should turn into Hulk again,which he did.So is Bruceforever gone? 3)Hela:Blanchett by far was the best part of the movie,her stellarperformance and her look were amazingly accurate to the comics,shelooked convincing and acted royal and for once I saw an evil characterenjoying her colors and proudly wearing them.Personality wise she wasHela mixed with Angela and Gorr and her powers were mostly drawn fromGorr which while cool was disappointing,her action scenes were cutshort,her screen time was unfairly small for the one supposed to be THEVILLAIN of the movie and despite all this she was the best developedcharacter in the movie in my mind.The most disappointing thing abouther and Valkyrie was that their epic fight was reduced to a few shotsand that was all,not event a small 3 minutes scene.Her getting stabbedor kicked by the asgardians felt weird since she is presented as Odin'sright hand,not that it damages her but looks pretty careless for thegeneral who helped conquer the 9 realms.Also Fenris was reduced to herpet gal dog,while nice to see her it was a very stupid decision.Even ifher scenes were meaningful,she was super underutilized. 4)Odin:His death was rushed and I didn't't really feel the tragedy init,his joke about the God of Hammers was good tho,I would also like topoint out that I liked him giving Thor that extra boost of confidenceto let his power loose for once.I also loved seeing his true face,a warhungry powerful being,who along his daughter knelled the 9 realms intosubmission but after all,had a limit which made him question Hela'ssanity and purpose in all that.5)Loki:Arounded character since the Avengers,he is in the movie to addto Thor's relationship,has a few good jokes and some nice moments.6)Valkyrie:Thessa did an amazing job playing a legendary warrior,huntedby the past who succumbed to alcohol and man hunting to bury her painand loss but it was weird how she was so easily convinced to join theRevengers.I loved her suit and her action sequences. 7)Surtur:2nd best addition to the movie,it was great to see him in thebeginning,his design was superb but even in his weakened state I felthe was defeated too easily.Him being reborn and fulfilling his destinywhile facing Hela was pretty epic but short lived,the true meaning ofthe movie was brought to life by this guy and he was at his job for 3minutes or so.8)Grand Master:The character seemed like a Psychotic ruler of a trashyplanet,didn't't feel powerful or truly evil,just mad,if that was theintention than bravo to Golblum but I feel the best parts that came ofthe characters like his speech at the end,the talk in the arena,etcwere his work and not the script.I liked his way of dressing and howquick he would switch between moods and ironically how he hatedviolence. CGI:Looked very good sometimes like Hela vs Surtur scene,Hela vs theValkyrior,Thor vs Hulk,everyone vs the army of the dead but the scenethey changed,where Hela emerged from her prison was bad in terms ofeffects,they filmed a new sequence and then added the old,alley onereaction when she caught the hammer. Soundtrack:It was formidable,especially the Immigrant song added to thebiggest action pieces throughout the movie. Landscapes:I was beyond happy with what we got,Skar,Asgard,ruins of theold cemetery below the Throne room,the secret fortress,Hell,Hela'sprison,Norway,Sanctum Sanctorum and of course New York. Personal observations:1)Hela as a mix of characters I felt ended up doing more bad for herthan good,her comic self is so much superior to this mixed bag theydid,it ended up being good thanks to Blanchett's acting.I was sodisappointing we got no throne in Niffelheim but a cheap prison set upby her father,powered by his life force. 2)The Asgard scenes while more meaningful than Skar were too short,veryinsightful but short. 3)Taika's directing was wrong for this movie,the comedy was good but itneeded more seriousness,more cosmic action,more Ragnarok and lessimprovisation,because not everyone is Goldblum or Blanchett to rock atthese things.4)I sure Hope Hela takes over Death's role in MCU and we will get herback,she deserves this,both her and Cate unless they want to wasteanother Oscar actress...
