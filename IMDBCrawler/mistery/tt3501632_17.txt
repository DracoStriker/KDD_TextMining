(There might be some spoilers ahead but very vague.)I grew up with Marvel comics and Thor was always my favorite. None ofthe Thor movies were really up to the standard but as a huge fan I likethem. Combined with other MCU movies which were getting better andbetter I had big hopes for the last Thor movie. I can't even begin to describe the disappointment. I wanted to leavethe theater by the beginning of the second act. Disney effectivelydestroyed everything Marvel was building all these years!I was warned by some friends that movie was terrible but still I hopedI would like something. The Story has immense potential but it wasruined beyond belief. The Ragnarok ... the ultimate doom .... and theymade a joke of it!?!?!? Sir Anthony Hopkins (Hanibal Lecter) and CateBlanchett (Galadriel) making fools out of themselves made it evenworse. If this movie was made by someone else like the Monthy Python crew itmight be fun but like this ...I would have given it 0/10 if possible. After this movie I willcertainly not going to watch Infinty Wars. Even more I will skip TheLast Jedy and anything that has Disney label in the future.This is blatant attempt to attract new fans among younger generationsby appealing to their shallowness, selling them cheap tricks anddistractions instead of a good story and directing.
