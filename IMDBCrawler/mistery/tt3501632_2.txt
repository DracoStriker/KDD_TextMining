I know some people are worried about the humour on this movie.But theyused it excellently in this flick.This movie to me,is at least on thesame level with Guardians of the Galaxy 1.I mean both guardians andThor 3 made me laugh but never felt cringe or sensed any forcedjokes.There were also very intense and emotional moments in this Thormovie.The fight sequences were so damn epic.When it comes toaction,this movie is close to Lord of the Rings 2.They did a good jobon reflecting the epicness of the Ragnarok event. The last trailer ofthe movie got my attention.And I made one of the best decisions of mylife by watching it.Hela,Valkyrie,Hulk,Thor,Loki,Grandmaster they all did pretty goodjob.Especially Hela.She was so gorgeous and menacing at the same time.Tessa Thompson kinda surprised me with her great performance btw.
