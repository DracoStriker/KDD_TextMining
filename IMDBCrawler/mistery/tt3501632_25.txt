Don't listen to the purist cry babies. This is a non-stop joy ride ofcolor, humor and action. All the characters are great and CateBlanchett as the villain is epic. Hulk is the best Hulk yet, Loki isgood, and Thor is the best Thor yet. There is plenty of laughs and theCGI is so good. A couple of cameos and just so many great subtleties.Go see it, and if Im right, which I am, come back and give it thereview it deserves, because its at least an 8.5 out of 10 if you'reconservative, but I gave it a 10.
