This film tells the story of the God of Thunder, who is trapped on awaste planet and has to win a tournament in order to gain back hisfreedom. In the meantime, he has to race against time to stop an evilforce destroying Asgard.Perhaps inspired by the success of "Deadpool", "Thor: Ragnarok" hascomedic elements beefed way up. It gets to a point where I think thereis too much comedy and not enough heroic demeanor. Fortunately, thebalance of comedy and heroic action is successfully struck by themiddle of the film. The jokes in the second half of the film inducesgiggles, but do not distract viewers from the story. The story isintense and the visuals are great. Cate Blanchett is stylish and yetchill inducing in her new look and feel that I have not seen in any ofher previous film. I feel a little sad about what happens to the maincharacter, and I wish it did not turn out that way. I enjoyed watchingit, even though I wish the superhero elements is emphasised more.
