Thor has always been a little too serious and self-important. AndDisney-Marvel have decided enough is enough.Storyline, Blah. Baddie, Blah. Action sequences, Blah. Length, Groan.But it's FUNNN!! This should have been a summer flick coz it's purepopcorn fun.Hulk is a hoot but for me, Jeff GoldBlum steals the show.Go have a blast.
