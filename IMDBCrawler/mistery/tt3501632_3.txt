This movie really exceeded my expectation.For me it is already thesecond best comic book movie,right after Logan.When I ve watched the both of the trailers,I ve thought Thor 3 has thebest trailer in this genre so far.Trailers really met with myexpectations.You are gonna see epic showdowns just like the way you imagined.Glad they didn't go on serious,boring mode like they did in Thor2.Cause that movie bored me to death just like man of steel did.Lastly,I just wanna say that Taika Watiti is pretty damn good directorwho can make both good stories/plots and brilliantjokes/references(just like deadpool's humor).Thanks again for all the joy you gave me Marvel.
