First things first, if you like Marvel Studio films then you're goingto enjoy this one. If you dislike Marvel Studio films (why?) then thisone isn't going to convince you to jump on board with the MCU. Thor andHulk/Banner team up and the banter between the two is at times veryfunny. Tessa Thompson did give a decent performance as Brunnhilde, butto be honest, I'd rather have had Jaimie Alexander's Sif in this flickas we've got history with that character. However, I definitely seeBrunnhilde becoming integral part of the MCU and can see her characterbeing expanded upon if they make a Thor 4.The soundtrack (which I loved), CGI, and action all complement themovie. Taika Waititi directing was, as always superb and I would loveto see Marvel Studios give him more projects to work on. I think hishumor would fit Spider-Man or Iron Man pretty well. The reason this doesn't get ten stars because yet again the villain isunderdeveloped and although we're told time and time again that Hela isthis all powerful Goddess I don't quite feel it. I can't really discussit without going into spoilers, but I found the character underwhelminga bit. However, Cate Blanchett was amazing both to look at and herperformance. I would highly recommend you go see this. Probably best Superhero movieof the year in my opinion.
