If we judge the quality of Marvel movies regarding pure entertainment,Ragnarok is easily one of the best Marvel movie yet. It is filled withLaugh Out Loud moments and stuffed with emotions. This movie alsosolves the villain problems of Marvel, all thanks to the brilliantperformance by Cate Blanchett. This is probably best portrayal fromChris Hemsworth yet after his movie Rush. One of the biggest positivesof the movie is it has the right amount of known/beloved characters andnew/exciting characters. However, as a negative aspect of this movie, Iwould say this is the most Marvelish movie yet. They treat everythingas an opportunity for a goof. However, thanks to the chemistry betweenHulk-Thor-Loki, it will be a stand-out movie in the highly crowded MCU.To sum it up this movie was a riot from start to finish. Audiences aregoing to love this movie. I hope it sustains its run when JusticeLeague drops in the theaters.
