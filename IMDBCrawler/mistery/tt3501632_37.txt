I just got home from Thor: Rganarock and boy, it was a fun movie. I amreally happy that they went in a different direction with comedy ratherthen with the boring suffering and seriousness of Thor 1 and 2.Thor has short hair which works, mjollnir getting destroyed does notaffect the story, and maybe will be a future objective for Thor torestore it in upcoming movies.They made the Hulk talk which is awesome, this also makes him have apersonality and he becomes quite likable.Cate Blanchett is amazing as usual, also heads up for Idris Elba andTom as usual, he being regarded as a fan favorite.As I mentioned there is a lot of comedy, but its not overused and thistime it actually works, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 style, which gives agreat tone to the movie.The end is maybe a little confusing, where Asgard is being destroyed. Imean Thor can't defeat Hela, but the fire monster can, but Thor at thebeginning of the movie destroyed the fire monster ? Maybe cuz he hadMjollnir ? Whatever. I reckon they needed to destroy somehow Asgard tomove the story forward, but they could have done it in a different way.Also very good visuals all around, but heads up for the scavenger trashplanet looks absolutely amazing, they they made it look really sci-filooking, the city, spaceships etc, like something you would see maybein star wars, or blade-runner, well not actually but sort of, which iskinda good.The action is very good, the story is simple so there is not much notto like.All in all a very good viewing, if you like humour, good action go andsee it.I give it a 9/10.
