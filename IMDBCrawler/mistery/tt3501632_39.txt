I mean seriously, no kidding! that breathtaking opening action scene,that exhilarating fight scene between Thor and Hulk on the arena, thosecountless hilarious scenes that literally made me laugh out loud(seriously!), that touching moment with Odin, that sad but satisfyingending, that shocking first post-credit scene, and the list goes on andon and on made this movie the greatest, the most epic, and the mostawesome superhero movie of the year! (whether or not "Justice League"could live up to that title, I guess we'll never know until Novemberthe 17th arrives) Some critics (or maybe just one, I dunno) say that "Thor Ragnarok" isthe boldest Marvel movie to date, in which I say it's true! I mean, howthey stir and twist one of the greatest and the most well- knownmythology in the world into a super-hilarious comic book movie (thatperhaps upsets some people in the Scandinavian countries, from whichthe epic tales of Thor originated) that people and fans love is the keyto Marvel Studios success. I never knew who Taika Waititi was before,but after I saw his movie yesterday, I can confidently say that he isone of the most promising new names in fully-packed- action-movie genrein the history of Hollywood.now that I have watched this movie yesterday, I'm now looking forwardto watching other Marvel Studio movies in the years to come such asBlack Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3,Captain Marvel, and the most importantly, Avengers: Infinity War andits sequel. The wait is killing me, wake me up when those movies arriveon the theater, will ya?
