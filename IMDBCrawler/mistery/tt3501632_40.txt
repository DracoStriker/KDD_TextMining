I saw the premier last night. This is definitely the best Thor movie,but let's face it... that's not a difficult thing to achieve. It's fun from the beginning to the end. It's lightning fast, therearen't any dull moments at all, but it's missing a little gravitas. TheThor character has suddenly become the complete opposite of what he'salways been. There's hardly any transition. The same goes for Loki. Itworks though, it just seems a bit off.The supporting characters are fun. Hulk/Banner is great as always.Valkyrie, Korg, Grandmaster they are all colorful joys to watch. The villains however were (as always) underwhelming. Skurge, though hegets his minute in spotlight, feels wasted. Hela, though I love the wayBlanchett played her, is just a ruthless powermonger. There's hardlyany background or reason to some of her actions. And Surtur well, he'sjust a means to an end (pun intended).Conclusion: It's good. It really is. You'll laugh, but you'll miss alittle seriousness at certain moments in the movie. And like mostMarvel movies, the villains don't marvel.
