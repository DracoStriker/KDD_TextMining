Three Thor movies, three quite different films. On this occasion, afterthe much lauded success of other films in the franchise like Guardiansand Deadpool. (Which I love.) It is easy to see why they would chooseto duplicate the comedic style.This is my favourite of the three Thor films by a clear margin. I waschuckling quite regularly from the very first scene. However I didthink are they taking the balance of comedy and drama a bit too far attimes. Often you feel yourself hanging on waiting to see if there is apunchline coming even in the more dramatic moments. Even when thebodies are piling up. (The Sokovia Accords have no jurisdiction in thewider universe.) For the most part the directors approach of encouraging improvisationdoes appear to work very well. But sometimes it does feel like there isa real lack of the "straight man" to add structure to the chain gun ofgags.On the whole I enjoyed Thor Ragnarok. It falls into the top five of myfav Marvel movies.
