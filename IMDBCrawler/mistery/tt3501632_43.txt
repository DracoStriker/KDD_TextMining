My God..what is going on in Marvel Studios HQ.They really improvedthemselves in CGI and in color palette.By the way,I am glad they movedthe place of "hammer destruction" scene from city to field.Cause in thefirst trailer it came to my attention that while hela was destroyingthe hammer the blast that came from it didn't effect the alley atall.Now it made more sense that they are doing in a field. The conceptis one of the best you can see in superhero movies.They balanced thehumor and seriousness perfectly.There were also brutal moments whichwill surprise you.Especially the 3rd act is pretty brutal.I heard thelaughter of audience almost on every funny moment of the movie. I neverthought a Thor movie would have an awesome soundtrack.I can tell thatit really gives you the Guardians of the Galaxy 1 vibes. So ingeneral,the movie is one of its kind in this genre and very unique.
