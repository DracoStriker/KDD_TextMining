*** This review may contain spoilers ***Thor Ragnarok directed by Taika Waititi that brought you What We Do inthe Shadows definitely gave me the perfect ending to Asgard. There isso many emotions that was brilliantly executed by Waititi. Worthyinclusion of Led Zeppelin The Immigrant Song that plays through firstbattle scene of Thor. Anytime the song plays it give me chills and fullof epicness while grinning the entire time. People complains the movieis full of jokes and not having the stakes. Well, let me tell you thatis not true. Thor Ragnarok actually managed to pull serious and brutalmoments when it needs to. You know what??? I had have never felt themovie is full of comedy at all. Now, let's talk about the villain. Helathe goddess of death is definitely ranked at my top 5 Marvel villains.Valkyrie steal the show for me as a badass drunk warrior. Inconclusion, it is a memorable movie for me and it is worth watching. Imight go watching it again.
