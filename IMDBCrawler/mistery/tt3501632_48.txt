In this Taika Waititi (Boy, What we do in the Shadows) directed film,written by Eric Pearson (Marvel One Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on theWay to Thor's Hammer, Marvel One Shot: The Consultant), Craig Kyle(Ultimate Avengers, Hulk Vs.), Christopher Yost (Teenage Mutant NinjaTurtles, Star Wars: Rebels), based on comics by Stan Lee (Iron Man,Thor), Larry Lieber (Iron Man, Thor) and Jack Kirby (Captain America:The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron) and starring ChrisHemsworth (Rush, Ghostbusters) as Thor.After taking the crown from Surtur (Clancy Brown: The ShawshankRedemption, TVs Daredevil), he returns it to his homeland where Thorfinds that his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston: Thor, TVs TheNight Manager) has taken over Asgard and hidden Odin (Anthony Hopkins:Silence of the Lambs, Thor) on Earth, but upon his death, Hela (CateBlanchett: The Lord of the Rings, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button)God of Death and their powerful sister, comes to take the throne forherself. Thrown across the Universe, Thor is first captured by Valkyrie(Tessa Thompson: Selma, TVs Westworld), sold to Grandmaster (JeffGoldblum: Jurassic Park, Independence Day) and held captive on theplanet Sakaar where he and other warriors, including Korg (an inspiredturn by director Taiki Waititi), are forced to fight for hisentertainment. Ultimately Thor is pitted against The Incredible Hulk(Mark Ruffalo: Avengers Assemble, Now You See Me), but without hishammer, can Thor not only win his gladiatorial duel against his formerAvenger friend but also convince and assemble a team (Hulk, Valkyrieand his untrustworthy brother) to stop Hela and prevent Ragnarok, thedoom of the Asgarian civilisation? This action, adventure, comedy filmhit all the right notes for me. The humour was spot on, right up mystreet (think Deadpool), and this and the action never felt forced. Allthe actors were on their A game and for me, a huge Loki fan, I have toadmit that in his own small way, Korg stole the movie like Loki did inThor. Not even the turn from Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch: TheHobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, TVs Sherlock) could beat it.I was pleased that Hela, the main villain, got her character arc asthis has been lacking in some previous Marvel films and has for me leftthe baddies flat, and this time the epic fight scenes bookend theserious moments well. As perturbing as it was for a fan of themythology for Hela and Fenrir to be used not as Loki's children, itworked for the film and Goldblum's wackiness gelled as well as Samuel LJackson's bad guy Valentine in Kingsman. Yes it is awful when theysummarily kill off some favourite characters, in some cases notablywithout even giving them a line, and concentrate more on Skurge (KarlUrban: Star Trek, The Bourne Supremacy) but here too they give him ameaningful character arc, he wants to be worthy and he gets his chance.Heimdall (Idris Elba: Prometheus, Pacific Rim) is busy trying to hideand save as many innocent Asgardians as he can while Hela searches forthe sword that will help her start the apocalypse for other worlds. Andthough Banner worries that allowing himself to turn back into the Hulkmay leave him that way forever, he too gets his emotional scenes whenwe see the cameo of Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson: We Bought a Zoo,Lucy) and his chance to shine against the terrifying Fenrir.The soundtrack is epic in its own right, up there with GOTG1, and thefilm does not feel like more of the same (as some of the superheromovies have sadly started feeling), it feels back to its best. If thisis to be the last Thor movie, then they gave him a great one to bowout.Yes the movie had a few flaws (e.g. Thor has never wanted the power ofruling, Banner may stay as the Hulk), but as the best way to describethe film is pure fun, I am going to give it 10/10 despite these becausethat is just what most people need at the moment, joyous escapism.
