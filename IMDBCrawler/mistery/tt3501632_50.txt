Under the direction of New Zealand director, Taiki Waititi, Thor:Ragnarok is Marvel's most audacious film in their cinematic universe todate. Not only does it supersede the previous Thor films, but does soin the funniest and entertaining of ways. By far the most unorthodoxcharacter change within the Marvel universe, the new direction for Thoris pleasantly unique and sought-after, filled with Waititi's trademarkhumor and exuberance from start to finish. However, Thor: Ragnarok ismore than just a comedic act. There are dark undertones that prevailthroughout the core plot of the story, and the fundamentals of asuperhero movie are all present. From the opening sequence, the actionand visuals are on point, the quality never deterred for a second. Andit has now become quite clear that Chris Hemsworth has embraced therole as Thor Odinson, showing off his comedic range and immediatelymaking the character much more compelling than the darker and least funof the Avengers that we were previously used to. In the film, Thor mustprevent Hela (Cate Blanchett) from unleashing Ragnarok, the end ofeverything, and in doing so, must assemble a team to face her head- onand save the Universe because-as he quotes-"that's what heroes do". The"Revengers" as he names them includes the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), "hisfriend from work", Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a hard-drinking formerwarrior, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the mischievous brother who no- oneshould trust by now. And it is not a Waititi film without an appearanceby the man himself, which came in the form of Korg, a hilariouslyvoiced rock-monster who was the champion of cracking a joke whenever hepopped up. Waititi's style of filmmaking is palpable to the point whereit becomes evident that everyone had so much fun making this movie,that is carried through to what audiences were seeing. This is whyThor: Ragnarok works so well and is so fun.
