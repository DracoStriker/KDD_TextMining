*TWO* POST CREDIT SCENES TO WATCH!Great starting sequence was pure magic, the banter, cinematography andthe ACTION! What I admired about this film is Taika Waititis brillianthumor, being from New Zealand appreciating it even more so. The actionsequences were slick, crisp, and actually watchable - as opposed tomany other movies who cover up the action with motion blur, too muchcamera work or just not enough scene time to appreciate the spectacle. Hulk and Thor were brilliant in this film, CGI was the best I've seenfor the Hulk, and his scenes with Thor are hilariously funny. Hella washellish and I loved it, her story interestingly made sense tying herinto the movie and not making it feel forced. Supporting cast ofValkyrie, Skurge, Korg, Grandmaster, Loki, Odin etc... all had theirplace and they all had their moments to shine, which is hard to do in amovie with a plethora of characters. Only thing to note is the pacing is sometimes a bit abrupt going to andfrom other stories happening within the movie, but it's not a biggy atall. One small thing is some impactful and emotional scenes (whichyou'll know what I'm talking about) didn't feel like it had the depthor impact that it should of ? Maybe it's just me, but I'll see thismovie a few more times over and maybe edit this as I would have hadmore time to reflect on it. All in all, from start to finish Ragnarok is a roller coaster ride ofbeautiful action pieces, quirky and snappy humor and a flagship forother Superhero movies to strive Thor!
