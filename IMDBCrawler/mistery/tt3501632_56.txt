The third film of Thor, the God of Thunder, finds him assembling a teamof "Ravengers" (which here means he's reuniting with his brother Lokiand another avenger, Hulk) in order to save Asgard from Hela, theGoddess of Death and the coming Ragnarök.What director Taika Waititi brings to the table is very unique andinteresting. Not only is this the funniest movie in the MCU, it's alsothe most entertaining and the most emotional one. It has plenty ofjokes (all of which are hilarious) but it also has some emotional depththat I wasn't expecting.The cast is obviously perfect. Hemsworth's comedic talent is insane andhe has great chemistry with Ruffalo's Hulk. Cate Blanchett's Helaoffers a great cbm villain. The rest of the cast is great too. Thevisuals are out of this world, the action is some of the best I've seenall year and the movie as a whole is a must-see event. For what seemedlike a filler movie until "Infinity War", Ragnarok more than blew meaway. I can't wait to experience it again.
