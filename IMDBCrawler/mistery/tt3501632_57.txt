There are some beautiful shots and colours in this film! Especially aslow scene with the Valkyrie girl, just visually stunning. The posterfor this film being one of my favourites of the year.This one contains a lot more action and comedy, similar in tone toguardians of the galaxy. Could be considered a good or bad thing but Iliked it. Furthermore some minor characters like Heimdall are expandedupon, which is great because I really enjoy his character. However you need to be a marvel fan to understand some scenes, don'twatch this if it is your first as you may be confused. It moves quitefast in the beginning but gradually the pace gets a bit better. OverallI would hold this in high regard, just under Captain America: civil warand The Avengers.
