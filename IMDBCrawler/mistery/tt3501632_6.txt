"Fun" isn't a dirty word. It's also not a word that means "not art" or"lacking drama." And the word "funny" likewise doesn't negate artisticintegrity or drama. Anyone who thinks these words are contrary to greatfilmmaking or "true art" simply doesn't know what they're talkingabout, and should probably stop trying to discuss cinema. Humor,comedy, and satire not only have a long and glorious history in art andexpression, they are in fact very hard to do correctly. Writing comedyand directing comedy is every bit as difficult, if not more so, thanstraightforward drama in many ways. And to whatever extent fun andcomedy in films can also serve to purely entertain sometimes and to addlevity to situations, that's not bad nor limiting of art either.It speaks to the absurdity of modern film debate and fandom that I evenneed to point out such glaringly obvious, fundamental truths aboutstorytelling, movies, and art. But such is the nature of rabid, narrowpersonal preference driven by bizarre loyalty to one publishingcorporation over another. Fandom is always -- generally speaking --turning everything into "us versus them," but the extent to which it'sdevolved into outrageously uninformed and limited claims of what is orisn't "art," is a newer development and a sign of the shallowness of somuch of our modern discussion of cinema when it comes to genrestorytelling.Thor: Ragnarok is fun, and it's also funny. It is also dramatic, it isalso terrific art, it is also the best Thor movie by a wide margin, andit is one of the best Marvel sequels released so far.If thosestatements or words bug you, then get over it and grow up
