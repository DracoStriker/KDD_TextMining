Marvel did it again! The best thing about Marvel movies:I know what toexpect and I get what I expected. Thor Ragnarok is just 2 hours of fun.The plot may be simple, the characters may be undeveloped, but I didn'tgo into the cinema for a Oscar best picture nominee. The constantjokes, the beautiful visual effects, the amazing soundtrack, evenbetter than the Guardians I think, are just the things I paid for.Totally worth the money and the time. And spoiler alert, some may wonder how the fire monster beats Hela butThor beats him at the beginning of the movie. My theory is that thefire monster is brought back by the eternal fire at the end, so itmakes him much bigger, hence maybe more powerful.Anyway, one of Marvel's best movies, the very definition ofentertainment, I will see it in cinema again.
