I just came back from seeing it and this movie is awesome man.1) the action scenes were top notch in this movie. Thor has never beenthis epic in the MCU. He does some pretty epic sh*t in this movie andhe is definitely not under-powered anymore. Thor in unleashed in this,I love that.2) Marvel did a damn good job in hiding some spoilers in the trailers.3) design-wise, the movie is totally beautiful. not a single bad effectin the movie. even the scene that changed from city to field looksbetter on the actual big screen.4) the freaking soundtrack. absolutely perfect. Immigrant Song FTW.5) Hela is totally bad-ass too. powerful, commanding, with just theright amount of scenery-chewing. hell, a lot of characters are sodelightfully over-the-top in this.6) great supporting cast too. Valkyrie owns everything the moment sheenters the movie. even Surtur was pretty darn hardcore. and Korg isfreaking hysterical. Man I loved Korg!7) the movie's got a lot of humor. that may be a problem to some?..but,when it's time to take things seriously, the movie does exactly that.specially towards the spectacular third act, when real sh*t is goingdown, the humor dials back a ton. It is only during the Sakaar portionsof the movie where most of the humour is, not without several momentsof sincere character interaction of course.8) I thought what they did with the "Ragnarok" part was kind of genius.this may not be the Winter Soldier of Phase 3 they told us, but it doesmake some significant changes to the overall MCU, or at least, the Thorsection of the MCU.9) The pacing of the movie was perfect. Plus there wasn't a singlescene in which I felt bored.Overall this was one of Marvel's best films for me. It would definitelybe in my top 5 marvel movies along with civil war, winter soldier,guardians of the galaxy and iron man 1. I'll probably rank it at 2nd or3rd!!!
