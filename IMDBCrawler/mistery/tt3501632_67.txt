I read through some of the hate reviews and they must be purists ofThor and Ragnarok and by the looks of things they are in the minorityfor now.I had high hopes for this film after the disappointment of Blade Runner2049 and all I can say is it didn't disappoint.For me personally this is the best film I've seen this year and by farthe best Thor film, great visuals, great action and very, very funny.Some great cameos at the beginning that I wasn't expecting, excellentinvolvement of Dr Strange to get the ball rolling. my son thoroughlyenjoyed and he's quite reserved when sitting watching a movie with mebut he was laughing away and some of the scenes.Again as usual sit right to the end the very last credit Roll onInfinity War
