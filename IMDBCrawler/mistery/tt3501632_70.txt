The film started off with more than I expected. A few issues I didnotice was that several trailer bits were cut out of the film. Thethree warriors could have had a bit more to do before dying. Sif shouldhave been in the film as a hero but as long as Marvel still use her.The new characters Korg, Skurge, Hela and Valkryie were veryinteresting. Another clever thing the film did was put the DoctorStrange post credit scene into the film which was quite clever. This film was way better than the first Avengers. A lot of the filmsare better than Avengers but people just don't get that. Ultron wasbetter, Doctor Strange, Captain America and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol2 should be rated higher than Avengers so I expect any true fans torate Thor Ragnarok higher.It deserves 10 or 9 but certainly no lowerthan 8. Avengers Infinity War I fear may ruin the ending for this film,especially if all the surviving Asgardians are killed by Thanos likethe Infinity War trailer showed.Loki and Thor did some funny things like the "get help" thing. BruceBanner remained as Hulk for two years is a bit bizarre. If he does nowpermanently stay as Hulk then it suggests that his actor is quitting.Korg and Heimdall need to return some day for more action. Now that you know some viewpoints, go and watch this. You'll definitelybe pleased if you do.
