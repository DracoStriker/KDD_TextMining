This is a fantastic look back to how movies used to be made. Withoutthe three hour snore fest and when Cinema was at its peak. Its funnyand smart with comedy that is not in your face so much as all aroundit. It really is a brilliant debut in the big time by this kiwidirector. It is up there with logan for my all time favourite move. Allyou have to do is sit back and enjoy.
