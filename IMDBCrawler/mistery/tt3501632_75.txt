Thor: Ragnarok did not disappoint! On the contrary, it actually blew meaway. Out of the 3 Thor movies, this is without doubt the best one.Some say the humour is futile and aimed at 12 year olds. Well I ammid-30s and I had some really good laughs throughout the movie. It is cool to see the other Marvel superheroes pop up. If you're likeme and not reading too much about the films and what characters they'llfeature, before going to see them then you'll get a nice surprise. Alsosome new characters are being introduced. Korg is bound to crack youup. Everyone does a good job in this film though. Loke is still a bit of ascene stealer, but not like in the other films where he rules the roostcompletely. 130minutes flew by. As always the CGI is astonishing. And the Valkyriesflashback scene is beautiful. Fight scenes have you excited! Andfrankly, any film that opens and closes with Led Zeppelin deserves anextra star! I have no problem giving Thor: Ragnarok 9 out of 10. It isup there with Guardians of the Galaxy.Pleasantly surprised! A great addition to the MCU.
