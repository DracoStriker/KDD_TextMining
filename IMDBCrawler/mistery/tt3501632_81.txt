One of the biggest challenges with an ongoing series is crafting astory that is on par or better than the prior offering and that thecharacters continue to grow so audiences do not get a rehash of whatthey have seen before.With "Thor Ragnarok" Chris Hemsworth has returned for his third soloouting, and fifth outing overall as the heroic Asgardian warrior Thor.This time out Thor is on his quest to track down the Infinity Stonesand finds himself plagued by visions of Ragnarok: a legend detailingthe fiery destruction of his home of Asgard.With an action laden opening, Thor believes he has ended the threat andreturns home to find his father Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), has beensent to Earth and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assuming hisplace.Thor ventures to Earth with his brother which sets a series of eventsinto motion, the result of which unleashes the long imprisoned Hela(Cate Blanchett), who plans the subjugation of Thor and Asgard.Naturally Thor is not going to put up with this, but finds himself midbattle knocked out of his transit home and on a remote world calledSakaar.As if being stranded far from home is not enough of a challenge, Thoris forced to become a gladiator for the erratic Grandmaster (JeffGoldblum), whom Loki has managed to charm and become a part of hisinner circle.As fate has it, Thor becomes matched with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), andmust find a way to survive and make his way home before Hella candestroy all that he holds precious.The film is the best of the Thor films and it is engaging from start tofinish. There is a significant amount of humor in the film but it doesnot feel forced and is very appropriate to many of the scenes. The filmalso has plenty of action and the blend between comedy and action isdeftly handed by Director TaiKa Waititi who never lets the film becomea parody of itself nor take itself too seriously at times. He knowswhen there is a time to laugh and when there is a time to be deathlyserious.This allows for a deeper and more enjoyable and engaging Thor than hasbeen previously seen. He is not as one-dimensional as he has been inthe past as the strong, quick to anger muscle that I would love to seeexplored in further outings.I had worried from the trailers that the movie might be more of a videogame as it seemed heavily dependent on retro style CGI and camp humorwhich made it seem like something out of the 80s. While there areelements of that, the film mixes the old and new to create one of themost authentic and enjoyable comic adaptations seen to date. Itcontinues the winning formula of Marvel Studios and of course, sets upthe next outing for Thor in "Avengers: Infinity War" as well as thelarger Marvel Universe as we a whole. The film also has some greatcameos and I am curious to see how the addition of the newly introducedcharacters will be explored down the road. The return of Hiddleston wasalso a real treat as he is so good as the mercurial but always sly anddangerous Loki that he commands your complete attention every time heappears on screen.Marvel has once again set very high standards for comic based moviesand has again delivered another winner that you will not want to miss.4.5 stars out of 5.
