Ah, 2017. What a wonderful year in superhero movies, from Lego Batman,Logan, and Guardians Volume 2, to Wonder Woman and Homecoming. Thisyear couldn't get any better, until Thor Ragnarok. With the first twoThor movies having dark tones, it's nice to see some color in the worldaround the god of thunder. This movie is funnier than the Guardians,has a better villain than the Avengers, and has cleaner action than,well, any of the MCU films. It is my favorite MCU film, and finallyproves that you can make a good Thor movie, even a great Thor movie. Ijust can't wait until the Hulk trilogy is finished, because it's off toan amazing start. Go see this movie. FINAL RATING: Great, surprising,and expectation- exceeding.
