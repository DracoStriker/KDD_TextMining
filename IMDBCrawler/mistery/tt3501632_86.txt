I am very surprised and disappointed to see some negative reviews hereon IMDb. OK, this is not the first time IMDb lets me down, but cmonpeople, this is really fun. All the actors, especially Jeff Goldblumobviously had great fun in this movie. Don't miss it! P.S: I also cannot understand the hype around Guardians of the Galaxy.OK it's fun too - but saying this movie is "GotG wannabe" is seriouslyunfair. It may rather be other way around!
