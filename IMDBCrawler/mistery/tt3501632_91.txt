Here it is, our God of Thunder is back after AoU.As many reviews said that this movie is light-humored movie, I canconfirm that's true. However, for me, it didn't reduce much essence ofthe theme. It's well delivered. Other than this, I do very like thevisualization and cinematographic, especially on bifrost fight. Itbeats GoTG for sure.Okay, the characters. FFS, Hela is OP. Thor didn't have any chanceagainst her. She is unstoppable and cannot f-word die. She is goddessof death, after all. Maybe I can put her in the third position ofstrongest villain on MCU below big-purple man and Surtur. I didn't listDormammu because we have not see his true strength.So, conclusion. Nearly cry tears for joy by seeing the original powerof Thor, Valkyrie is awesome, Loki is still God of Mischief, Heimdalldidn't have Soul Stone neither nor Hela, there is a character whototally change in Infinity War later, and we get a tiny glimpse on howThor get stranded in Star Lord's ship in first post end credit scene.It's a 8.0 of 10
