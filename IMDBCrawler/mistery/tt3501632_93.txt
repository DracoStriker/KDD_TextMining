This word couldn't get out of my mind during the final scene, the onewith the Battle of Asgard. Thor: Ragnarok exceeded my expectations,some low ones, considering the last two mediocre films. Ragnarok,however, is pure entertainment, I smiled all the way through, I caughtsome laughing out-loud moments... Marvel did it again.OK, let's begin. So far, Thor (2011) and The Dark World (2013) are theworst of the MCU, but Ragnarok totally is one of the best. Is the firstof the Thor movies that left me wanting more Thor movies, if youbelieve it or not. It has a great idea, supported by great performancesfrom a stellar cast and some great direction, all thanks to Mr. TaikaWaititi. I expected it to be just a setup for Infinity War.. and boy,I'm glad that I was wrong.The director Taika Waititi managed to bring to the movie a colorfulfunny tint. Ragnarok is weird, but in a good way. I believe it has theopportunity to become a classic of its genre, alongside with The DarkKnight and Logan.Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Ruffalo have some great lines, but myfavorite character of the movie was Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie.. such agreat way to introduce a character. Ragnarok is by far the most fun of the Marvel movies. The chemistrybetween Ruffalo's Hulk and Hemsworth's Thor will make you smile all thetime. The movie also has some great action moments.Even if Cate Blanchett was great in the role of Hela, I didn't find hera very intimidating villain... that's where Marvel must work on.. andwhere DC got it right.All in all, with the help of an unforgettable soundtrack, plenty ofaction, and laughing out-loud moments, you won't have a better time atmovies this year.7.8/10
