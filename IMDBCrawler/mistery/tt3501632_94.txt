Superb Experience and characters to make even a non fanboy geek out onthem totally. While DC have destroyed classic concepts and Charactersby employing c-grade writers both in comics (JL:Gods among Us) andmovies (Batman Vs Superman, a wasted opportunity) while time and againMarvel really produce one roller-coaster after another.The way they create old stories with new addition and mix up and slowlypresent awesome surprising characters to create new story-line to enjoyis just unbelievable. I hope they will keep entertaining us. KudosMarvel Team.
