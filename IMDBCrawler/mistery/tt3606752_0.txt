Not what I was expecting, *spoiler alert* franchise killed lightningMcQueen, he never recovers to race again. Huge disappointment for myson, it was literally the death of lightning McQueen.Lightning McQueen then goes on to become the youngest trainer inhistory bringing to an end his career as lightning McQueen. McQueengives his position to a trainer that is older than the newer modelJackson Storm, she happens to be a girl. So my son is waiting for heroto pull through and then gets shot down by McQueen giving up. The spotMcQueen gives up is won by a trick and not by speed. My son is notgoing to cheer for a new when the old is no more. Definitely earlydeath of number 95. Very depressing movie. The trailer was definitelymisleading.
