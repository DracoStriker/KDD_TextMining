Let me start by saying I love the Cars movie franchise, so when I firstsaw the trailer and the poster for this latest instalment, I was veryexcited.To start off with, I was thoroughly enjoying the film and loved thiswhole Cars version of the Rocky Balboa films. It was great. Theyincluded Doc Hudson as a vital part of the story of Cars too, which Iloved. Great character. Then comes along this new piece of crap, Cruz.I didn't like her character from the get go. Dull, annoying and aboutas funny as a funeral. Anyway, that was fine. Sometimes you just haveto accept annoying, two dimensional characters in a film. However, what I can not bare to see is PC bullcrap. It turns out that***SPOILER ALERT*** rather than making this miraculous comeback afterall his training, Lightening McQueen quits the race. He quits andallows his trainer, Cruz (a female character of course) to finish therace. Of course she wins, of course she is the hero, of course thecamera switches to other female Cars characters celebrating (wooooowomen empowerment!!!!!!). I am all for equality. I really am. But thisis not the case. It is so in your face and as soon as Cruz took overfrom Lightening, I actually wanted to leave the cinema. They havebasically retired lightening and made the new Cars hero, a woman. Imean, what is that about, seriously? completely goes against the plotof the film and basically b***h slaps its viewers and fans. "Hey folks,you think your hero Lightening, the character that makes the films, thecharacter we know and love is going to win?! *B***H SLAP* NO! he isgoing to crash out and you now have a woman hero!!! yay pc guys,yaaaay!". Literally ruined the film. Tell you what Disney, next time you want toshove some PC rubbish in our faces, write a whole new film and make thehero a woman. Don't dump on our old beloved heroes. Dicks.
