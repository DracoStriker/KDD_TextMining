In this one, Lighting struggles to keep up with the new young technocars on the circuit and has to go find his racing mojo. Along the wayhe meets a young racing car who is ironically his trainer, it turns outshe is the one who needs the training from Lighting. Lighting teachesher his techniques, whilst trying to improve himself. For me it was a bit of a poor excuse for a Pixar film, and the endingis probably one of the worst I've seen in an animated flick. It justfeels so unfulfilling and so not like Lighting McQueen. (If you do not want to know the ending do not read on!!!!)In the end, lighting makes his return to racing after training in theoff season. During his big comeback race, halfway through he decidesthat the car he has been training deserves to try and finish the race?So instead of it being make or break for lightning, it turns intomaking a name for the young race car that he has been mentoring. I think the ending will be Marmite for people, some will love it andsome will hate it. I personally didn't like it at all.Everything up to the ending is quite slow paced and a tad boring. Sadly Cars is another franchise that has suffered through the making ofsequels. Shame.
