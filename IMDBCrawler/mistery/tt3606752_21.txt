Took the kids to see this early after release, figuring I'd enjoymyself as well since the original was pretty well done. Sadly, I wasmistaken.The premise of technology evolving makes sense as a core story elementand had potential to be interesting, but was used for nothing beyondplaying into the franchise's nostalgia for the good ol' days of racing,on which the first Cars movie hung its hat.Lightning's various training methods were all obvious setups for amontage of critical moments in the big race, and for a movie whichoften embraces reality regarding what real cars can *actually* do, CruzRamirez' big finish with a literal 360 flip seemed forced andunoriginal (didn't Lightning do one in the first movie?)Speaking of Cruz, her switch into the race came completely out of leftfield, and seemed like another brutally forced story element. Imho, itwould have been better to end the movie with "Well, Lightning lost buthey kids, here's why it's going to be OK" rather than "Look how theseguys can exploit a loophole in the rules! Yay, winning is all thatmatters!"At least the kids enjoyed their popcorn.
