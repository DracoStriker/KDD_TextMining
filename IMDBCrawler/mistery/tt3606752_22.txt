** Possible Spoilers **First off, I have no idea what these other reviewers are talking aboutwith this "alternate universe" theory. The fact is this movies tiesperfectly with the first one. All the same characters are in the moviefrom the first one and many references are made to Doc, so not sure howthis thought came about. This movie is essentially a version of cars where Lightning McQueenactually aged, meaning he is not the same age as in the first one. Withage, especially in sports, comes new, and younger, talent. In thismovie lighning McQueen is faced with this same challenge, new, younger,talent who are training in new, more advanced, ways. With this youngertalent and better training methods (Lightning McQueen still trains likehe did under Doc) Lightning is having a tough time competing againstthe new guys. He essentially has to make a choice, adapt with newtraining or retire. I won't go into the details of his choice as Idon't want to spoil it for anyone. However, this movie was very good and, I thought, a fitting end to thefranchise. Can you imagine a Rocky movie where Rocky never ages andjust keeps fighting and beating everyone? No, and that is not how theRocky series ended. Rocky retired and helped the new up and comingfighter. That is somewhat what happened here. I can only assume the others making the reviews wanted Lightning to beperpetually young and just keep racing and racing and beating everyone,movie after movie. The writers wisely chose not to follow that formula.Yes, I will agree, there is a bit more of a story here than just pureracing, and perhaps that is what people didn't like. However, thatdidn't make it a bad movie. I hated Cars 2 but I did really like Cars 3. It's not a perfect moviebut also isn't what people are making it out to be. Give it a chanceand I think you will like it.
