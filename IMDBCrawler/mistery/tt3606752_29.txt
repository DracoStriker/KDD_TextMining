To be honest the story started really solid and quite interesting with(by what the trailer told to be) a more mature and unorthodox approachto the cars franchise. After Cars 2 I personally expected a largeimprovement, and for the most part, there was.The characters themselves are the same we know and love, and though theplot was quite rushed and a little lackluster due to the let-down DocHudsons' mentor turned out to be, it was quite enjoyable.I was ready to settle on a seven or extend to an eight, but then theending came around. It's a kids movie, so it was to be expected a twistlike in the original Cars was to occur, but the problem with this isthat Cars 1 had a rookie lightning McQueen, ready to take on anotherday. But in this movie- not only is the purpose denied, but formsLightning into a defeatist unlike the confident yet respected characterhe grew to be.The problem in Cars 3, mainly- is purely that the built up rivalrybetween an actual challenge to the now veteran McQueen, is easilydefeated, after McQueen literally gives up the race to 'give thechance' to Cruz.The gesture is meant to be kind and all, but honestly- it ruined a good80% of the movie and its' build-up of the rivalry. A simple andpredictable, yet well executed plot, is far better than a rushedattempt at a morally acceptable ending aimed to teach kids the meaningof maturity whilst ruining the point of the title.Lightning's final race, turned into him giving up half-way to let acomplete rookie beat what seemed to be an extremely fast and talentedsuper car.The cinematography was well-executed, and the comedy quite nice, allthe while holding to the main issue but ultimately ruined by what mostand myself consider to be one of the biggest anti-climaxes I have seento date.Though I enjoyed the depth on Doc, and his background- as well asLightning's growth- the ending and plot choice ruined a potentialmasterpiece of a film.Better luck next time Pixar.
