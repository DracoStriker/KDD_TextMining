My kids feel asleep. Does that say it all. It was slow pace and verylittle funny moments. We saw despicable me 3 last week and it was greatand they laughed forever. This was a wast of money and time. My kidssaid they felt like we was in the theater for days later. They can'ttell me one single moment from the movie.
