This moving was really boring. The plot was slow and there was noaction. There were several particularly slow scenes. Even my kid gotbored and we left the theater early. Turns out I forgot my keys, so wehad to go back in. My kid changed her mind and we watched until the endand it still sucked. What a letdown. She has no interest in carsanymore. I guess it's more Paw Patrol and Doc McStuffins for us.
