I warning you all right now SPOILER ALERT. So one might believe thatthis film would be about lightning feeling bad after his big wreck andwanting to train and work hard to beat the car that made him feel thatway but no it's about him training while everyone is tearing him downwith the excessive old age jokes, and telling him that he will never befast enough to beat the car who caused him to feel that way in thefirst place but despite that lightning continues to train and failingat every point which by this time who would think he would see someprogress but no it's quite the opposite he gets slower and the cherryon it all toward the end of the movie it's the big race against thecharacter Storm so lightning starts the race after the first lap hequits and sends in this flat character Cruz to take lightning's numberand finish the race despite the character Cruz has no racing experienceand she magically beats all the new racers including lightning's rivalStorm but it gets worse after the race lightning retires fromracing(despite throughout the whole movie him saying that he will neverretire) and lightning becomes Cruz's coach. It gave no closure tolightning's story and not to mention the character Doc is dead withoutany explanation but magically the truck that trained Doc and was olderthan Doc was still alive which again makes no sense. So to sum it uplightning retires and becomes a defeatist. Don't watch unless you wantyour kids to be disappointed.
