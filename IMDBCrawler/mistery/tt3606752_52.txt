As for a kid's movie, it is a good way to teach how to give up. Hey, ifyou feel you're not up to the task, instead of trying harder, stepaside and let other people do the job for you. Then surf on theirsuccess. Everyone is a cute and special snowflake and even if it wasn'tyou to do the hard work, you still get a medal...Way to go Disney/Pixar. Hard work probably never payed up anyway... Ohwait!...The movie had potential. Gave 1 star because it was completely wasted.
