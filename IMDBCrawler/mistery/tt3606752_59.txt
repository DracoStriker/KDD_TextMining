Cars 3 is probably just as good as the first one. Way better than Cars2! It is really emotional. It has some good laughs! The story isamazing! The characters are great. I liked the new trainer CruzRameriez's character. We get some older cars and new youngergenerations like Jackson Storm. Good Ending (NO SPOILERS I PROMISE!).If you really like Cars 1, you're gonna love Cars 3!
