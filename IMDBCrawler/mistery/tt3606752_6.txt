Even my son was asking throughout then entire 1 hour middle portion ofthe movie , "why aren't they racing, is he gonna race Jackson storm...". I just kept saying yeah son eventually. Then it's the female thatends up racing in the end and my 5 year old son experience his firstepisode of disappointment and fraud. How do you explain to a 5 year oldthat it's politics and the moral of the story is no longer innocentheroic comebacks but now it's about equal opportunity and forcing ideason young minds. Kids just want to see a good , animated race movie ASADVERTISED!!! Instead it's 10 minutes of racing, and an hour and a halfof training and build up that leaves you asking yourself... did thishave to be nearly two hours long?! Garbage
