This was made with feminism in mind. I assume these movie in 2016-2017were so far in production, they were already enthralled in the feministagenda, and had Hillary Clinton invested in their movies and wanted topush that agenda.Sad how this series shows the state of progressive Hollywood, but itwas a decent movie but pushed identity politics.Essentially Lightning is now the old racer, being replaced by themodern generation and meets a young female race car, who is just asgood as the male racers, but misogyny and lack of belief in herself isthe ONLY reason she never races.If you can stomach the feminism and the overtones, it's not that bad.But this movie is not subtle in its message, women can be as good asmen, gender is a construct and virtue signal and men are bad.5 out of 10, if you can stomach the feminism.
