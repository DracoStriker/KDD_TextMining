Overall this movie was, to be honest, I don't even know how to describeit. If I could remove the ending of this film I would give cars 3, 8 to10 stars but, sadly you can't do that. The movie does a great jobsetting up this underdog story where lighting must overcome incredibleodds or his career as a racer is over. I like how in the movie lightingtries to improve his chances first by technology but when that doesn'twork, he goes back to what helped him in the first movie, DOC. Themovie does a great job with these two acts but the third one completelysh**s on itself. Lighting, from the very beginning of this film hasbeen fighting left and right to keep his career as a racer. He saysmultiple times how racing isn't about money, or stuff, its about thethrill, its about going 200 mph, its about the fun, and its about thelove for the sport, and this is why he will never stop. He trains andlearns all he can for the big race at the end of the movie and then,wait for it, he....... QUITS so some another car (Cruz) can have her chance as a racer, WAIT, WAIT,WAIT. Okay, I get why lighting did it, the movie was slowly telling usabout Cruz and how she wants to be a racer so badly but no one takesher seriously, and shes too scared to do it by herself, but after aroad trip with lighting, lighting sees her for who she truly is, aracer. Now this would make a good story, if Cars 3 actually focused onthis from the very beginning instead of focusing and marketing on acomeback story, only to be replaced right at the end by a completelydifferent story. The way they did it in the film was forced, sloppy,and just plain bad. The movie gave about 10 mins for this new storyabout Cruz, 10 MINSSSSS. In the trailers and for about 90% of Cars 3,the story is about lighting and his struggle to get back to the topeven though everyone is telling him to quit. He does this because heloves to race and doesn't want to stop. That was the main focus of themajority of the film. However at the end, after lighting tapped intoDoc's legacy, learned new tricks and trained very hard, the storychanges to lighting training a car who wants to be a racer, LITERALLYDURING THE LAST RACE. Thats how rushed and bad it is. If they keptlighting in this race, made him win and then start teaching cruz(making her like the new lighting and making lighting like the newdoc), that would of been great, but nope. To sum it up, Cars 3, to be honest, left me sad, deprived, unsatisfied,confused and kind of angry. For me, Cars 3 hasn't ended yet. Its likethe first 2 acts in Cars 3 were slammed together with the last part ofCars 4. I don't know why they did what they did in the last act but itruined the movie, left the whole comeback story hanging and madelighting quit racing, even though he would never do that. I wouldrecommend watching this movie and then turning it off when lightingmakes his first pit stop in the final race, and just imagine thatlighting won using the new skills, and tricks he learned from themasters.*********************************************************************editttt (After Watching it for the second time)*********************************************************************So after writing this review, I was wondering if I missed anythinghinting, or leaning to the final act where Cruz becomes a champion. SoI decided to watch it again. Going through the movie again, I noticed two things. The big one waswhen Lighting realized that the best part of Doc's life was teachingLighting, not racing himself. Making Lighting realize that He doesn'tneed to race to keep on racing, he can pass the torch to someone elseand still get the joy of racing, if not more. As I said above, thewhole Cruz story makes sense and I get it but, I still don't like howLighting dropped out of the biggest race of his career. This is becausethe second thing I noticed. Lighting said he isn't done racing. So whywould he give up that raceee. What they should of done was allowedlighting to win or lose (I have some cool ideas for him losing) andafter Lighting shows that he is the best, or some other message, thenhe trains Cruz on how to go against these new gen racers, and soonracing isn't just about tech anyone, its about heart and the will towin.
