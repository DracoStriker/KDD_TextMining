Cars 3 is directed by Brian Fee and stars Owen Wilson once again asLightning McQueen, we also see Armie Hammer join the cast along withChris Cooper and Cristela Alonzo. The story takes place some yearsafter Cars 2 and focuses on an aging Lightning McQueen fighting for hisplace in the modern racing sport, when a next generation of racing carsbegins to emerge. I have quite nostalgic feelings about the originalCars film since I was a kid when I first saw it. Of course now I do seeit's not one of the best Pixar movies but I still enjoy it. As for Cars2 I don't really care for it. For me it's a very mediocre film thatbring nothing new to the table. Is Cars 3 an improvement then? I thinkit is due to one very important thing, the racing! Racing is finallyback along with McQueen as the focus of the film and for that reasonalone it's better than Cars 2. Cars 3 also successfully introduce somenew characters, Cruz Ramirez(Cristela Alonzo) is a welcome addition tothe universe and Jackson Storm(Armie Hammer serves as a decent villain.Also the animation is, as expected from Pixar, really great especiallyin the second act. The few points i've mentioned are what in my opinionmakes this film an improvement over Cars 2 but unfortunately it's avery mediocre film. Although the focus of the film is on Racing it'sstill unfocused and feel like 2-3 movies slammed into one. And due tothis it's hard to grow emotionally attached to any of the characters.But up until the third act I was fine with the film and thought it wasas good as the original, but when a specific choice is made in thethird act the movie lost me. I could have been fine with the directionthe film took if I had been invested in the characters but I wasn't.Cars 3 is a fine kids film that adults also can find entertaining, butdoesn't hold up compared to the other Pixar films. Final rating: 6/10??
