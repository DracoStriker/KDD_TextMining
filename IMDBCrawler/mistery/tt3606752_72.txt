Jay And Nick both enjoyed the first Cars Movie. It was not Pixar's bestwork, but it was still enjoyable. The second one was horrible. It waspointless and there was just no reason for it to be made. This one,however...while it's better than the 2nd Movie it's still not as goodas the first. It leaves off where the 2nd one left off...LightningMcqueen is still in action and is still stronger and faster thanever...until the day someone by the name of Jackson Storm (voiced byArmie Hammer) turns up and is beating Mcqueen at every race and everystep of the way! Mcqueen needs to train harder if he is to beat Storm,and it wont be as simple as he thought! All the characters were good,mostly the new ones. Don't go in expecting for all he old characterslike Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) to be in it much. Mater and all theother characters were only in it for 8 mins! That's not to say that allthe new characters are bad, they are actually likable and pretty good.The problem with the film is it's not paced well enough for kids andit's not quite likable enough for adults, so it's a tricky movie torate. The movie is decent at every second that clicks, and it neverreally gives you anything emotional like so many other Pixar Movies do,but it's probably worth a rent. Only go to see this if you have nothingbetter to do or you just want to kill 100 minutes. Could have been somuch more! 2.5/5 stars- Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers.
