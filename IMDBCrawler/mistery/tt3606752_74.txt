The movie in general was a great movie, it had a great story line and agreat ending. I love the fact how they brought back the old memories ofDoc Hudson in the movie, it was like the story was really based aroundhim! The movie ended perfectly when lightning came in the pits andswitched with Cruiz to give her the chance that she always wanted. Itended perfectly, I would 100% give this movie a 10 and in my opinion isthe best out of all 3.
