This is the BEST story ever among all series, but yes this story is NOTfor children. The children will not understand how the world works whenthe young replace the old and the old are supposed to give space andsupport the youth. This is the fact, how good the old but they cannotbeat the youth in term of physical matter. Cars film tells about theathlete's life when the senior have to retire when they get old. It'snormal but children cannot accept this easily of course. It will makethem down! And Disney failed to bring this story more interesting forchildren. Even the new yellow car character is lack of charismacompared to McQueen.However, I'm impressed when Disney tried to capture modernization eraand they called it as "Future". The fact that Disney brought McQueen tohis old age it makes the movie more realistic. When the viewer watchthis movie since the beginning and they grew up so the story won't be ahuge problem. But yeah, this is not good at all for children who watchCars in a raw, we can say "Movie Marathon" as these children haven'tgrown up yet.
