This is the decent ending to a great first movie. I wasn't very surethat bringing my 12 yo son to this would be a good idea.I was wrong. He really enjoyed it and we cried like babies when Mcqueencrashed (no spoil eh it's in the trailer). This is no car race movielike fast and furious, haters got it wrong IMHO. This is a movie aboutsport spirit and generations.As usual from Pixar , this movie is technically perfect. Thanks to them!
