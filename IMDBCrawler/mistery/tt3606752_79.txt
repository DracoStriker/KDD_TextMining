Inspiring, exhilarating, exciting, humorous, and more, all that wasCars 1 you will find in Cars 3. The classic is back. Love the sounds,exhaust, the reflections, shadows, smoke from the tires, the feel ofthe race track, down to the debris found on a hard run road, it's allthere. Back to the country, the roots, receiving life lessons from theOld Pros. Finding what's important in life, the good in people,inspiring others. No political agenda like that in Cars 2, which was aflop. Simply put, if you loved Cars 1 you're going to love cars 3.After reading so many bad reviews, much of which comes down to theending of the movie. People expect a classic come back, a Rocky Balboamoment and didn't get it, there has been much disappointment, broke myheart too. I would have liked to have seen that come back, then letMcQueen move on to inspiring others like Doc Hudson, in the next move,example Cars 4. If you payed attention to Doc Hudson, "you got a lot ofstuff kid", "all I see is a bunch of empty cups", "When was the lasttime you cared about something except yourself, hot rod?", etc. Doctaught life lessons, one of which it's not all about YOU! Cars 3instills that teaching. Doc Hudson would have been proud of McQueen forinspiring others.
