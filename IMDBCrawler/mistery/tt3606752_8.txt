My son was born in 2006, we watched first movie maybe a hundred times,and second one several times. Cars was like Star Wars for us. And 3rdmovie? At the end of the movie my 11 years old son was so upset to seeMc Queen as a retiring loser car, he only said: "I'll never talk aboutMc Queen, this is the end". Bugs Bunny does not get old, why did youhave to retire Mc Queen so early? And we hate that yellow car, Cruz, itcan never replace Mc Queen. Mc Queen is red, how could you turn it toblue?! This movie is a big disappointment, we'll try to forget it
