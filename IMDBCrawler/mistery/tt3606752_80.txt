When I was a bit younger all I could think about was how cool LightningMcQueen was and how great the first Cars movie was. Being a little bitolder now, Disney tried to keep up with the kids who saw it when theywere younger. They did a great job of that.I don't get the bad reviews. The visuals were stunning. The charactersfelt real. (The nods back to Doc Hudson got me a little emotional andit's hard for movies to get to me!) The humor was more than I expectedout of a Disney movie for kids. It put a huge grin on my face.I haven't really been too very impressed with Pixar's latest films butthis one is a true winner. It isn't pretentious and it makes you feelgood. People were saying this feeds into the PC demographic. (McQueenletting the female character come and win the race for him.) Now whenthose sorts of things happen in movies I am the first one to call itout. It's always silly and forced and never done well but this wasn'tthat. They weren't just being PC. Lightning grows up. He passes thebaton and gets to be Doc Hudson for the next kid in line and I lovedthat. It really just warms you up. And like I said, that's hard.Cars 3 brings in the stunning visuals that the first two didn't haveand brings in the old backwoods feel we got in the first one. This isone good film to sit down and watch for a fun night. I give it a goodol' 9/10.
