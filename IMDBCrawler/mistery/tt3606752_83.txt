This animated film tells the story of a tracing legend, who is losingluster because youngsters are rising fast in the leagues."Cars 3" is still fun and lively, with a lot of races to deliverthrills of speed. I think it is entertaining for children, as the carsare happy and the motivational teacher is full of energy. The plotfocuses on the new character, the motivational teacher who has anunresolved issue, and the plot sets out to resolve it. The story isnice and fun for children.
