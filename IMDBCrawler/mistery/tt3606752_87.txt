I thought the Cars movies were alright, being about talking cars andjust racing and zooming around. Still, I saw this anyway and wasimpressed. Though I've seen a ton of CGI movies, I was blown away bythe CGI in this one. The voice acting was good (trust me; I've heardbad voicing in the past) and plot well-done, even though you couldpredict the end. Speaking of the ending, though, it didn't make much sense to me. Theproblem wasn't quite fully fixed.The movie, in my opinion, was better than the second (where cars, whichare basically people, were being smashed and murdered) but impossibleto live up to the first. It's a nice movie that is worth watching.
