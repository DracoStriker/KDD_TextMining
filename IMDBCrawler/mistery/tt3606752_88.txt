I saw many of us criticizing the film. They may seems OK, yet i doubtwith that. It reminds me a change in generation. I first saw the firstsequel being a student, with not that rationality in my mind regardingthe meaning of life or how its gonna go through the paradigm of shift.Now i see the last one keeping me on the red car character whose hightime is about to an end. Movie finishes with a fresh set up on stage.We might see in the next sequel where the new car (of third sequel)will be the hot rod like the second sequel. I will dream my new bornbaby kid on that character. :)
