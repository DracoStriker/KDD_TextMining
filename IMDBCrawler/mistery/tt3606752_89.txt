After seeing this film with my two siblings, we claimed that it waswell worth our time and agreed that it was better than both of the twoprevious Cars installments. When I returned to IMDb, I felt that thisfilm was being robbed with the stream of over-exaggerated 1 starreviews that I saw.I feel that I should probably tidy up the situation here.The main reason for all of the hate towards this film is directedtowards the final race; instead of finishing the race alone, LightningMcQueen allows his former trainer, Cruz Ramirez, to finally have her"first race" by letting her complete and win the last half for him.Admittedly, I was quite surprised at this ending myself, but I feelthat giving the whole film "1 star" without regarding the rest of thefilm, which is excellent, is kind of immature. This is deliberate sothat Cruz can finally see herself as a "racer" and not a "trainer",linking to her dream from halfway in the film. Furthermore, if you lookat the alternative, I don't think it would have been much better: IfLightning McQueen completed the whole race and beat "Jackson Storm",despite the fact that not even a day before the race he was nowherenear reaching his speeds. This would have made the ending unrealisticand confusing.As for the rest of the film, I thought it was almost perfectly done. Iam so thankful that the director decided to implement references fromthe original Cars instead of trying to continue from the lesssuccessful Cars 2, which was a bit of a spin off from the original. Forexample, Lightning McQueen's opening monologue is repeated: "I AmSpeed". Parts like these added a real touch which my siblings and Irelate to well.In conclusion, Cars 3 has really put the heart and soul of the originalCars film back in action, with good humour, such as Mater, a good plotand memorable characters. I believe this 1 star reviews are overdramatic- if you have seen the original Cars, this film will beenjoyable for you.
