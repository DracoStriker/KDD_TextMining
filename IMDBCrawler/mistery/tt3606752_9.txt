I went to see Cars 3 with my younger sister and, as a long-time Pixarfan, I guess I have to finally face the music: Pixar movies are simplynot as good as before anymore. The first installment of Cars, eventhough not as beloved as some of the studio's other efforts, was aheartfelt and entertaining story for kids and adults alike. This, onthe other hand, was an incoherent mess with so much boring andunnecessary dialogue it makes your head hurt after leaving the theater(but you're still happy it's all over)The movie kicks off with something I bet most kids won't evenunderstand: Lightning McQueen is old. Yup, right. Even though he looksand sounds exactly the same, we have to accept he's old and can'tcompete against modern, shiny race cars. Now I don't think that's agood premise for a kids' movie, but it could give us adults somethingto chew on, right? Well, no. Apparently what we have to do is spend our time observingrace simulators and a whole bunch of absolutely indistinguishablesecondary characters telling McQueen what to do in his situation, withsome race scenes thrown into the mix to keep us awake (although it hada reverse effect on me). One of them (the Thunder Hollow Speedway) wasparticularly messy and disturbing. It left my sister bewildered andconstantly asking why are these cars so evil and why they want to killeach other.Oh, and about an hour into the movie we understand that Cruz, anannoying yellowish "coach" car who apparently doesn't know how to raceat all, is a main character, too, and the story isn't even aboutMcQueen proving he still got it, but about this new car, who isn't evena race car at all, magically defeating all those big bad new racerssimply because girl power. Well, I'm a girl and I'm not impressed. Boring story, boring characters, and an ending that defies logic evenin the world of sentient vehicles; I'm pretty sure that's the end ofCars franchise, and despite fond memories of the first movie, all Ihave to say is good riddance.
