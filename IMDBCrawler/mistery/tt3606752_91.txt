When It comes to the Cars franchise, these films aren't week receivedand people say It's their worst film, to me I did love these films whenI was young, to this day I still like the first movie, sure It hasproblems like how the world was created and It's predictable, but Itdoesn't turn It In a bad movie, I didn't take everything around thefilm seriously like how cars are now people, how they eat andjokes/Visual gags all that stuff, I seen films where I don't askquestions and I just enjoy the ride.Now the first Cars I thought was a re latable and relaxing movie, Cars2 Is just okay.. but the worst Pixar film I seen, It does have coolaction scenes and fantastic animation as always, but It felt likesomething out of Dreamworks, BlueSky or Illumination, It's adisappointment coming from a wonderful Animation studio.BUT! they seem to have take the hate from Cars 2 and made a new teaserfor Cars 3 and saying "Well If you don't like Cars 2, how would youlike It If you saw the main character getting destroyed and gettingtorn and really dark, now you'll want to see Cars 3 now", well from therest of trailers they do seem to take a more serious tone with the newone but still being a comedy at the same time, I was pretty worried atthe point but excited because Cars was a good childhood movie.I went to see It on Wedensday the 19th of July In a nearly empty cinemasince I did see It on a weekday and let me tell you how Pixarcompletely outdone themselves with this one, It's everything I wantedCars 3 to be, not any spy stuff like Cars 2, but more like what thefirst Cars was, racing, the plot Is executed fantastically while allthat original at all but It does It's job very well.Most of the characters I ended up like the remaking ones like LightingMcQueen and yes I still find Mater funny, but for the new ones the onlyone I ended up liking Is Cruz who Is like the Inscure trainer forMcQueen but It does turn around as the film goes on, I won't give Itaway but I ended up relating to the characters, others like JacksonStorm, Sterling, Miss. Fritter and Smokey are just basic charactersthat you'll except them to be, although I like Smokey out of the rest,besides Cruz, but Jackson Storm ended up as a generic villain which wasdisappointing because I wanted to like the villain because he did lookcool.The animation coming from Pixar Is still top notch giving us wellcrafted car designs, beautiful and realistic backgrounds and reallygreat racing scenes, so not much to say but still remains fantastic forPixar.The score composer once again by the Randy Newman like the first movieand while the film does reuse some of the music from the first movieand at the moments where It's expected, but what he did here Is stillgreat as usually, while sounding a little whimsy, It can be beautifulto listen to, even some of the song choices are really good as well.I do have one minor issue and that Is the film can be repeatable fromthe first movie making It a bit predictable, but at least they arerespecting the first movie and the late Paul Newman.So overall, Cars 3 Is one of the most pleasantly surprising films ofthe summer and this year, another well-crafted sequel from Pixar, whilenot as well written as Finding Dory and Toy Story 2 and 3, but It dideverything that I liked about the first Cars, this Is a must watch forPixar/Cars fans, It's my favorite In the franchise, I'm happy for Pixarto return to the first movie and make It even, so for that I say thankyou Pixar for doing the right thing and sticking to It and I can't waitto see Coco when It comes out.... In 2018...I'm going to give Cars 3 a nice 9.9/10.
