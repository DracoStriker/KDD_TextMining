I watched this movie without much expectation after the 2nd one, but inthe end, it turned out to be better than I expected. In the firstmovie, McQueen has gone through a great transformation, from a youngracer full of passion but also vanity to a calm, thoughtful andrespectable one. We have Doc Houston to thank for that. Then again, inthe third movie, he has gone through a second major transformation,something you may experience at your 40s. He is lost, desperate and hasno clue how to carry on. Yet, in the dark time, he found hope, not theway he imagined but way much more. He realizes who he is right now,what can he do, and what he should do. If the first movie is aboutMcQueen realizing the meaning of life, this one is about he buildinghis own legacy, just like his respectable mentor Doc Houston. And now,his life is complete. The visual are awesome, the scene are good and the old folks arecharming in their own way even though the story are not quite naturalas the first one. Every bit of the movie is a reference to thelegendary Houston Hornet, and to help me visualize the future LightningMcQueen. It is the time for our beloved champion to take a step back,enjoy his life with pride and leave the spotlight for younger racers.In movie, I feel like Pixar has gone back to its root: making a "feeltrain" instead of summer super hero movie (yep, I'm talking about the2nd one). Life is never easy or hard, it just the way it is. Sometimeyou are lost, stumble, but you will get back on your feet and move on.Sometime, things have to change and you can not keep them the way theyare, you have to accept it. And once accept it, you 'll find out thatyou have earned something instead of losing, you 've become a betterperson that you can be proud of. This is the perfect ending forLightning McQueen. I 'd give this movie a 7 out of 10. definitely watchit again.
