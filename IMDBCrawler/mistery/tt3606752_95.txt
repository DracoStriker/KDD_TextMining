(Flash Review)I was impressed not only with the spectacular animation quality (Ireally do think some of the dirt backgrounds were real footage withanimation layered on top) but also with the depth of the story. It wascertainly a tale with more obvious morals for kids than with Cars 2where little kids probably aren't old enough to care about environmentvs big oil issues. Cars 3 focused on character, not giving up andconsideration for others. The core of the plot was that a new era ofracers have become more dominant then the last era's models causingsome older racers to retire. These new racers have advanced trainingand technology at their disposal. How will McQueen response to the newchallenge? For those familiar with Rocky vs the technically trained andyounger Drago, the story line will appear familiar with McQueen lookingto his roots for his advantage. However, the writers put in aheartwarming twist to their story. There were many fun scenes, goodcharacter development (maybe some new character merchandise) and athoughtful story. More appropriate to younger kids than the last movie.
