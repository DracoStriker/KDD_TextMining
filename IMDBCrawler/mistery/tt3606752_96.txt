What we liked about the first one (and not the second) was thesimplicity and innocence in the story with a good heart and intentionmade for younger audience. This installment carries all that, one mightsay this is the sequel the original cars movie deserved. The themesthis movie carries is very much similar to the original and at timesfeels like you are watching the first movie itself with certaincharacters switching places, but nevertheless its much better than thelast one and worthy of a sequel. And as always Pixar's animation isbeautiful to watch.Verdict: Worthy of existence.
