I love Pixar films. Movies like Toy Story and Monsters Inc createstories with characters we admire and love. Now after two movies, it'stime for Cars to have its third and final film.The big question was lingering on mine and everyone else's mind: How doyou create a third Cars movie after that second one? Don't get mewrong, I loved the second movie and it's plot and flashy atmosphere,but it had a lot of bugs under its hood. Cars 3 goes back to its rootsand focuses back on Lightning McQueen as he faces off against the newmovie antagonist Jackson Storm (A.K.A Chick Hicks 2.0) Finally, afteran action spy flick that should've been rated PG, we get a Cars movieabout racing again!The way they brought back Doc Hudson and had the storytelling and feelof the first really shines in this movie, I love the characters. Italso gives a good laugh and I smile through 98% of the movie. Thecherry on top is that Mater is back to his old self! Same Silly oldMater, no spy guns, no sudden intelligence and no girlfriend! Just likeToy Story 3, Cars 3 shows us that this franchise can still pull off anemotion filled blockbuster. This movie proves the franchise hasn't runout of gas! If you loved the first Cars film, watch this one. You will not regretit, I promise.
