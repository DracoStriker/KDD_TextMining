There is a lot of bad reviews for this movie and i don't even get ifpeople understood what was going on in the movie. Lots of people talkabout taking their younger sons in the cinema and etc. The movie wasmade for the generation that saw the movie 11 years ago. Most of thosepeople are grown ups now. The movie show the ending of the great storyof Lightning McQueen. The graphics where awesome for an animated moviesome parts of the crashing of Lightning McQueen felt real and the storywas breathtaking. Its a happy ending for Lightning McQueen.
