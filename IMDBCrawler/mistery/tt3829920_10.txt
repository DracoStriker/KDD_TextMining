There have only been a few movies in which the theater I was in wentcompletely silent as the credits rolled. Only the Brave tells the truestory of the Granite Mountain Hotshots who risked their lives to stopwildfires across the country. It's films like this that always move methe most. A group of people who you grow fond of during the course of afilm band together in the most dangerous of circumstances for a commoncause. When done right, they can be extremely powerful.Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Josh Brolin, Miles Teller,Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Connelly, and Taylor Kitsch among others; all ofthem do a great job of creating a chemistry and realness between eachother. In order to feel anything when these men are entering theflames, there has to be real friendships and relationships builtbetween the actors as these real life heroes. Perhaps more thananything else, Only the Brave completely nailed the bond between theteam of hotshots.Going along with the bonds they have with each other, the film focusesheavily on a few of the men's personal lives, which is where the realemotion lied for me. Jennifer Connelly had the biggest supporting role,as the wife of Brolin's character, but that was far from the onlycharacter's personal life I felt attached to. As much as this a tributeto the men on the team, it's also a great film to honor those lives whowere affected by the team in any way shape or form.Kosinski's directing, the team of writers, the ensemble of actors andactresses, and of course everyone else doing the dirty work should becommended for the work here. Only the Brave is a deeply moving filmthat never takes advantage of the fiery source material to bombasticresults, instead only using it to honor the lives impacted. Truly oneof the best films of the year.9.4/10
