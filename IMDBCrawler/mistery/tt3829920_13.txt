I dreaded going to see this but I couldn't not. It's one of thosemovies you feel you need to see to get a dose of historic reality, like"Schindler's List, "United 93" or "World Trade Center", so that youunderstand better what happened, and remember. But for me at least,it's only the once. The reality of it is incredibly evident.
