For me, a movie is mostly about escapism. I see a movie to forget abouta bad day at work or global turmoil. If I can learn something in amove, all the better. This movie achieved both for me. Being fromNevada, I was familiar with the tragedy and I have visited Prescottseveral times, so I was eager to watch the movie. What I didn't expectwas the fine acting in the film. Brolin really played his part well andthe other characters are certainly those you will begin to care aboutand relate to. This movie was not about fighting fires it was aboutbrotherhood and courage. I learned that confronting a fire is similarto being in a war zone and the comradery among the men just as strong.It's a seriously emotional experience, but worth every one of the 134minutes. See it.
