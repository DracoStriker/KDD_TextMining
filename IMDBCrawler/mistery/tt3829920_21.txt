Opening night, 1055 p.m I went to see the only movie I wanted to see,Only The Brave, To all who sacrifice their lives, to do what they needto do, you have greatest gratitude, and thanks, Only the Brave gavethat to me and possible all of us, It's a must see film to all who feelthat kind of thoughts. An Academy performance by all.
