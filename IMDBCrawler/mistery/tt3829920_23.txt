I give the film 10/10 because how often do you go into a film, alreadyknowing the story and the ending and yet remain engaged throughout theentire film? I expected Josh Brolin, Bridges & Connelly to be great,they always are but Miles Teller is stand out. He was amazing. Veryriveting and realistic depiction of how the Granite Mountain Hotshotscame to be and the events leading up to the fateful day that claimedthe lives of 19 of the 20 member team. I had no idea of the extremelyphysical nature of terrain firefighting versus structure. Additionallythe toll it takes on the lives of the firefighters and their families.My Dad was home almost every night, these guys, during fire season areprobably gone 90% of the time, traveling where the fires are. There wasnot a dry eye in the theater at the climax of the film. The music,editing, dialogue, scenery and special effects were phenomenal. A mustsee movie. God bless our First Responders and prayers for theirfamilies.
