Based on the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots firefightersdivision, this film strikes a very emotional and moving chord. What'ssurprising is the fact that it's every bit a character piece andfocuses as much if not more on relationships as it does on fightingwildfires. The main focus is on Eric and Amanda Marsh (Josh Brolin andJennifer Connelly) and Brendan (Miles Teller). It successfully dealswith marital issues as well as redemption arcs. Honestly, if you make it through this movie without shedding a tearthen start questioning your empathy level. The final act is flat outemotionally wrecking. All three lead actors are deliver soul turningperformances and really should be in awards consideration. Thesupporting cast is also very good, especially Jeff Bridges. Overall,this a worthy lasting tribute to some very brave men.
