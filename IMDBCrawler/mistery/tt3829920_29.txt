I went into the theater that day not knowing very much about the actualhistorical event. I left that theater completely and utterly in awe ofMiles Teller and the entire crew. The tragic reality that this movie isbased on makes you feel so incredibly grateful for those who arerisking their lives while saving this country. I cannot urge viewersenough to go out and watch the film, all the while educating yourselfon these reoccurring environmental issues. The sacrifice these men makeday after day in attempt to preserve our country in very eye opening,and a week later something I am still thinking about it.
