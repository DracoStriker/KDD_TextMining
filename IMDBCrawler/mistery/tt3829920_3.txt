Personally I found nothing wrong with this movie which is something Irarely say when I go to the theaters now days. The cast was great andreally got you interested in the characters. It stayed mostly true tothe actual story of these brave men whilst throwing in a little bitmore drama and action to "Hollywood" it. The ending will have youshedding a tear even though we all knew what happens going into it. Waswell worth the money spent and deserves a higher rating than criticshave given it.
