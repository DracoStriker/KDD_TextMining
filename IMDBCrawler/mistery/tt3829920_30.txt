Only the Brave is a movie directed by Joseph Kosinski and stars JoshBrolin, Miles Teller and Jeff Bridges. The movie is essentially abiography about the the rise of the Granite Mountain Hotshots and howthey come together to put their entire lives at risk to protect theirtown from a dangerous wildfire.This managed to be a very interesting movie that brings you in veryquickly when the movie starts. It is very well acted from beginning toend with interesting characters and motives. It's interesting to seehow the members of the Hotshots' lives have changed as the organizationforms and grows big. The movie isn't fully character driven,fortunately. The movie does have a large focus on dealing with thearea's large wildfires, which are also highly engaging. It's admittedlyhard to critique the execution of certain scenes like the firefightingscenes in Only the Brave when it's based on true events. If I wouldlike to point out an issue that I have with the movie, it's that Ithought the story structure was a bit all over the place, but again,it's hard to properly critique a biography movie due to the fact thatit is based on true events.8/10
