I grew up in a forested area that was often ravaged my fires. I stillremember seeing the line around my childhood home where heroes likethose depicted in this film stopped a brutal fire in 2003. I found the acting in Only The Brave to be superb in that it is oftenunnoticeable - it's as though you're watching real people live throughtheir day to day lives. The story methodically engages you with thecharacters so that it does justice to the real-life heroes that arebeing portrayed. If you haven't watched this yet, do yourself a favor and go see it. Ithought this was a phenomenal tribute to the granite mountain hotshotsand all those who step into harms way for the good of others.
