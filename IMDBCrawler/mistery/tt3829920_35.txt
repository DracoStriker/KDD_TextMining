'ONLY THE BRAVE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) An action drama biopic based on the Granite Mountain Hotshots; an eliteteam of firefighters that fought to control the Yarnell Hill Fire, inJune of 2013 (the film is dedicated to their memory). It was directedby Joseph Kosinski (who also helmed 'TRON: LEGACY' and 'OBLIVION'), andit was written by Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer. The script is basedon the GQ article 'No Exit', by Sean Flynn. The movie stars JoshBrolin, Miles Teller, Taylor Kitsch, James Badge Dale, JenniferConnelly, Jeff Bridges and Andie MacDowell. It's received mostly ravereviews from critics, but it's also disappointed at the Box Office sofar. I really enjoyed it.The film tells the story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a team offirefighters granted the status of 'Hotshots', who heroically foughtthe Yarnell Hill Fire, in June of 2013. It focuses on Eric Marsh(Brolin), the leader of the team, and Brendan McDonough (Teller), ayoung father looking to get a new start on life. Each firefighter dealswith his own personal issues, while also risking their lives to protecttheir surrounding communities. The movie is dedicated to the realheroes that inspired this film too.The movie is a really passionate, emotionally charged tearjerker (Ithink almost anyone could cry watching the climax of this film). It'salso a really well acted and directed character study too, and at timesit's pretty suspenseful also. The movie is just a totally involvinglook into a firefighter's life (it's a superior film to 'BACKDRAFT' inmy opinion too), and really who's more admirable than a firefighter!There's no politics or prejudices involved, they just do what they doto protect others. It's just a really well made and inspirational film,that almost everyone should see (in my opinion).Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://youtu.be/eoAny_TuUM4
