This is a fitting tribute to the brave men who risk immense danger tofight wild fires on a daily basis and their supporting families. Thecinematography of the mountain scenery and vistas is stunninglybeautiful. I didn't know the story or anything at all about the filmand saw it on a pre-view screening before general release in the UK.Josh Brolin had a stand out performance and was totally believable. Thefilm was patiently put together to show the camaraderie and emotionalstruggles behind the heroics, but this dragged the film to a pedestrianpace when more action shots would have had more appeal. I was shockedby the final scenes especially as this was based on true events. I hopethe movie does well.
