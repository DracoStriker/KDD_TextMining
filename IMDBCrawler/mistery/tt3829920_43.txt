This had all the ingredients to make it a 10/10 but sadly it failed todeliver . I wouldn't want to take anything away from the brave firefighters onwhich this story is based and I feel now compelled to learn about theactual events . If I use THE PERFECT STORM as the benchmark for a film of this nature ,this fell short on too many levels . This is the type of film that should make you feel emotional and cry .The only characters and relationship that I felt any attachment werethe Eminem looking chap and Jenifer Connolly . Jeff Bridges looked morelike Beau Bridges ! Ultimately it spent too long getting to the finale - the build shouldhave engaged you more , the final half hour was the strongest part ofthe film but it was an uphill struggle to get there But the good news is it has got the story out there and shows the debtof gratitude owed to those who put their lives on the line to protectothers . I had no idea of the actual story and I definitely recommendyou DO NOT look it up before seeing the film as it will spoil thesuspense . Pad.A 5.5/10'
