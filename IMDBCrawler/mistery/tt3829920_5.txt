With the recent fires in Napa & Sonoma this movie is even moreinvolving and relevant. It's well made and filmed. And the story isfirstly interesting then exciting and tragic. It doesn't feel like itis over 2 hours long.There have been many movies about fighting fires in buildings in citiesbut not many about tackling wildfires in the country side. What isdifferent to see is they actually stop fires by controlled burning. anduse portable bags as fire shelters. There is quite a lot of back storyabout some of the characters mainly Josh Brolin the head of the unitand his quest to get the team certified Hotshot. His lovely wife playedby the mesmerizing Jennifer Connelly. Sometimes she is so slim on thehorse she looks like she is in a photo shoot. Glad they gave her alarge role. Miles Teller's character as a reformed drug addict also hasa pretty wife played by Natalie Hall. Miles is quite different lookinghere and acts well. Taylor Kitsch is the comic relief. Could have donewith a some more background about the others in the team though. There are a couple of small faults. The words on screen to show thelocations was in small white letters and hard to discern. The dialogwasn't always easy to make out. Some of the accents were a bit thick.Jeff Bridges always had sketchy diction. There isn't too much lingeringon the tragic deaths but would have been better with a bit more shownabout how they got actually got trapped. The part about gettingcertified as hotshots could have been swapped for more of this.The reaction of loved ones is handled in a straightforward way.It's good to see a movie about heroes that are just pure heroes withoutany question mark of war or politics hanging over their actions. One ofthe better movies about firefighting.
