Superb acting with a story line that'll draw you in and really make youfeel like you're part of the crew. Loved it. Can't believe someonewould rate this poorly and call it cliché. It's based on a true storyso I'm not sure how that's cliché. Either way - it's amazing and I'mglad they made the movie so the world can honor these brave heroes.
