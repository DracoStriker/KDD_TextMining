Only the Brave is another movie that is based on a true story. This onetells the tale of the brave volunteer firefighters known as The GraniteMountain Hotshots, who risk their lives to protect their remotecommunity. Josh Brolin (No Country For Old Men) stars are Fire Chief Eric Marsh, agrizzly old man who loves both his job and his men. Miles Teller(Whiplash) is the young new recruit who finds the support he needs inthe tight fraternity of firemen. Jennifer Connelly plays Teller's wife,Amanda, who keeps the home fires burning while her husband is outputting fires out.Only the Brave does an excellent job of showing the danger that thevolunteers have to endure and it also shows the bond between the tightgroup of men who put their lives on the line each day. The movie alsogoes out of its way to show the stress that the job puts on the men'shome life. The movie is based on an actual incident where 19 firefighters losttheir lives defending their small town against a wildfire. DirectorJoseph Kosinski, who's directed a couple of Tom Cruise's action films,puts you at ground zero of the raging wildfire and, using CGI effects,gives you the incredibly scary feeling that the men must have facedwhile running to the raging fire instead of away from it. That is anamazing feat of courage.The movie has many quotable lines. My favorite among them was, "Wedon't see things as they are; we see things the way that WE are." Thismovie is a fitting tribute to the brave men who died, from theirperspective, doing what they were only thought was right, because itwas their job.Only the Brave runs a little over 2 hours and it's rated PG-13. On my"Hollywood Popcorn Scale" I rate this amazingly inspiring movie aJUMBO.
