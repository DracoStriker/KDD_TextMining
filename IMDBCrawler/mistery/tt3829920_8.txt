"Only the Brave" conveys the true story of the heroic firefighters fromArizona, known as the Granite Mountain Hotshots. This movie isdefinitely relevant and timely, considering the recent disastrous firesin California. I know that there have been other movies based onfirefighting stories, but none of them have tackled the issue offighting and controlling a wildfire in the countryside. "Only theBrave" does that, which makes it so special and outstanding.Josh Brolin plays the role of the team leader of this brave group offirefighters. Mr Brolin has definitely given one of the finest, andperhaps one of the best performances of his career in this movie. Apartfrom him, there is the legendary Jeff Bridges ("The Dude") to add tothe star value of this flick. The rest of the star-cast have also givencommendable performances.The director, Mr Kosinski , has done an excellent job to depict thistrue story of firefighters on screen. He has delved quite deeply intothe mechanics of firefighting, and viewers will definitely appreciateand give more respect to firefighters after watching this movie. Iwould love to become a story-screenplay writer for movies becauseintriguing stories keep developing in my mind all the time. Employerscan contact me at svhot34@gmail.com
