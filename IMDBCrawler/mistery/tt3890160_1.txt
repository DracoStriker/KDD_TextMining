This movie had a lot of potential. It started out great, but it beganto fall apart rapidly just after the halfway mark. A more complicated plot could have developed, but the second half justseems rushed. The movie could have gone in several different and morefulfilling directions, but it went full cheese instead. Disappointing.It ends up being just a variation of "The Last Ride" (2004). SPOILER ALERT It's a given that being in debt to a crime boss means your debt willnever really be cleared, so that's okay for a movie.And you can suspend disbelief for driving physics and non-deployingairbags...But...Doc sending the third crew to meet with arms dealers was totallyunnecessary for the job they had the next day, because they already hadall the equipment they needed, so that whole scene was forced just fora plot device.Bats proved he was willing to kill for no reason, so there's really noreason he would have left Joe alive.There is no way Buddy would have been able to escape all those copsswarming him downtown. Then Buddy shows up again later after gettingshot in the chest. Superhuman villains in a non-superhero movie tend toruin the whole thing.Doc remaining in the place from where the heist was launched at risk ofbeing caught for no reason (even though he knew it was botched) made nosense, just like his sudden change of heart in "helping" Baby made nosense.Oh and Jon Bernthal is only in the movie for about 10 minutes, so notsure why he was given top billing, when he's pretty much just an extrawith a couple of lines. Baby's deaf foster dad had more lines (signlanguage) than Bernthal, yet he's not considered a main character.
