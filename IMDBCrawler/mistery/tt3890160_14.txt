With all the hype over this movie, I had to come in here and try and beone little island of reason amidst the ocean of insanity. For the lifeof me, I cannot understand how it's getting any praise at all, letalone heaps of it. The premise/plot is colossally stupid, so it'scheck-your-brain-at-the-door stuff from the get-go. But even withinthose cartoonish parameters, there is not one interesting story elementnor compelling character to be found. The movie is cliché after cliché.It has this one parlor trick, which surely you've heard about, where itoften syncopates the (ridiculous) action with the music track. To whichI reply, okay, fine. In no way do I see how this somehow elevates theterrible script and two-dimensional characters. At no point did I careabout what happened to anyone. I hate to overuse simple descriptorslike "dumb" or "pointless," but honestly, I can't use them enough aboutthis movie. If I can save one over-13 person the waste of time, I willfeel like a hero. Please save your money!
