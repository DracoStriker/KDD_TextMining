I can't believe this movie has an 8.1 IMDb rating at the time of myreview! The characters are weak and the plot is nonexistent. This isn'ta movie - it's a collections of scenes that do not quite mesh togetherto make it even remotely interesting. Despite all the action scenes, Iwas quickly bored. And it never got better - there was no plot twist,no interesting character development, nothing! Save your money and gobe bored somewhere else, for free!
