I read an early tweet that described Baby Driver as 'a mix-tape with afilm attached to it' and that proved to be an accurate comment. Thetweeter may have thought this was a good thing, but I certainly don't.Yes, there are some good tracks and the action sequences are elaborateand frenetic (a little too frenetic, actually), but the characters aredull, unlikeable and bear very little relation to the real world. Isimply did not believe in them, especially Darling, the sassy, kick assstock character that only a fool would consider to be a strong femalecharacter.Then there's Baby, whose laconic, boyish demeanour makes him a ratheruninspiring protagonist. His romance with Debbie, a cute littlewaitress, is yawn-inducingly clichéd, too.If you want a stylish heist film that isn't so bloody try-hard, thenwatch Drive. It's an exercise of style over substance much like thisfilm, but it has suspense, atmosphere and characters that couldactually exist rather than blaring music, mind-numbing action and flat,hateful comic book characters.
