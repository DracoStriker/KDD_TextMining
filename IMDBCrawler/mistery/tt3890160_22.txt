The film stars Ansel Elgort as the titular character in deep with someundesirables from the criminal underworld. To pay them back, he mustuse his driving skills to help with a number of heists. During allthis, he becomes smitten with a waitress (Lily James) who makes himfeel like he's more than just a criminal. He then decides to try andescape his life of crime, but he soon realizes that it's much easiersaid than done.I must say, Edgar Wright did a fantastic job with this film. All themusic fit so well in their respective scenes, combined with the greatacting all around to make one of the most entertaining films I've seenin a long time.Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, and Eiza González did their partswell and portrayed convincing mentally unstable killers. This is thefirst time Wright has worked with this much star power, specificallyAmerican star power. The actors played well off of each other,especially in scenes involving comedy where they nailed the punchlines.The music was good, not all of it recognizable by the average viewer,but effective nonetheless. Supposedly Edgar Wright based the wholemovie idea around the Baby Driver song by Simon & Garfunkel, which isan accomplishment all on it's own. Baby Driver was paced well, was never boring, and made me want sit backdown in my seat and watch it over again. I wanted to keep this review kind of short, but I did want to give youenough information to hopefully convince you to go out and see thisfilm if you get the chance.My suggestion: Do yourself a favor, go enjoy a night out at the moviesand go see Baby Driver!Seen at a advance screening in Roseville, Minnesota.
