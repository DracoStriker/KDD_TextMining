I really don't know if this is a spoiler, as the way I get it,everybody is going to watch this film because of this "device": actionon screen is synchronised with the soundtrack songs... And nobody havedone that before... Oh, except they have, they even call it a name:"musical" (and not only the ones in which people stop talking to startsinging, like "Singing in The Rain", but also those in which the musicis a fundamental part of the story, like "Saturday Night Fever"...) Andbefore that, there was something called "dance", but that's not thesubject here. Of course, some could argue that it's a non-musical filmwith synchronised action to music... Once again, it's been done before,like the Diva's on-stage performance matching Leeloo's fight in a hotelroom in "The Fifth Element", or the EVE and WALL-E open-space maneuversin Pixar's "WALL-E"...There are no twists (worth it, I mean), there is a granted happy ending(but then again, everybody could tell that from the trailer alone,that's no spoiler, really), and a bad guy (with a stupid name) to whompeople should sympathise, except that he's too dumb for that.The car chases are better than those from any of "The TransFormers"franchise, but I'm not sure it's a fair comparison (choreographed lamechases versus computer generated physical-laws-ignoring graphics...)I have to say, I was really surprised to see such high rating on IMDband Rotten Tomatoes. Either they developed a much better voting bot, orpeople are getting way dumber than the films they are watching...
