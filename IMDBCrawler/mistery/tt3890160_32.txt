How many chase scenes can you put in a single movie?Baby Driver. Can't believe the 8.2 rating on IMDb. I should give this a4 Star rating but I'm trying to offset all of the grade inflation here.Stick with music videos if that's your thing.First scene: Is the kid some sort of retard? I LOVE to watch someoneplay air guitar. He drives away like a maniac so, of course, the copsare going to chase him. Had he driven like an old lady they would havecruised away unnoticed. It morphs into a completely stupid-as-can-bechase scene. He loses one car in some far-fetched manner only to haveanother car immediately on his bumper.Scene 2: They divvy up the money from the bank and one criminal, who isobviously a tough guy because he is wearing a black leather jacketwhich is what all tough guys wear, messes with the silent kid while thegirl puts on a clinic of really bad acting and Kevin Spacey does histhing being the boss. Scenes after those two: Lip synching? Do criminals plan stuff out on a chalk board? The plan on the boardlooked like what an eight year old boy would imagine a criminal plan tobe but the movie version of the heist of the truck looked like a fiveyear old kid wrote it.A stylish shootout scene topped with what they think is witty banter:murder as art.And then the Post Office job got seriously stupid. What I like to calla Chinese Downhill.
