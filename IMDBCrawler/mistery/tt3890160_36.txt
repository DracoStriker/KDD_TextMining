This is the glossiest, over-produced action film that I've seen inages. So cringe-worthy are some of the "music video" style momentsthroughout the film, that I often came close to just giving up andturning it off. Once one removes all the catchy ear/eye candy music moments, the actionfilm that's left is really nothing terribly entertaining or original.However, on the bright side of things, Jamie Foxx needs to build acareer playing villains! He really stood out among a mostly tepid cast(even Kevin Spacey seemed bored to be involved). Really, save your precious time and go back and re-watch some 70s caperfilms. You'll be happier in the end.
