Everyone's gushing about how the music matched a few scenes and I meanlike.... Yeah? Welcome to movies, where sound is designed to match thescenes.There wasn't anything amazing.Bad acting from the main character. Bad writing as well, he makes a lotof stupid decisions which I suppose are the reason the story exists.Lazy and unrealistic writing. No chemistry between him and his "love"who are in love and run away after a date which entails going fordinner and then ending. This girl must be lonely as hell despite being a good looking waitress.She wants to leave her job and her friends behind for a man she doesn'tknow at all, except that he's friends with some criminal elements...And she's like hell yeah lets do this!OH and I assume she remains celibate for 5 years for him at a point. Again... They have had one date and barely any conversation, and nonookie.Just a lot of terrible writing in this like that which bothered me. Theaction and music scenes were okay. You can find much better looking atany top-lists.
