I went to watch this movie yesterday and I really liked it. What Iliked the most was the perfect combination between the music and thescenes. Everything seemed to match. I felt it was like a constantdance. The music picked was really good. So was the car scenes. Not100% realistic, however really good (not like F&F stuff). I totallyrecommend it. I will probably go again.
