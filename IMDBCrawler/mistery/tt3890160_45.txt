Baby Driver (2017)Beautifully edited and choreographed. Exactly would expect from EdgarWright. The soundtrack is superbly varied and overall an excellentselection. My only real negative is that the characters are generallyunderdeveloped and the story a little generic. This is all forgiventhough as it simply is beautiful to look at. Definitely watch this filmat least twice (to see all the hidden things in the background).9/10
