Wrote a big write-up, but unfortunately, this stupid site somehow atemy comment, so I'll just summarize and say, Lily James did a great job,I hated Ansel Elgort, I hated the writing, I hated most of the otherperformances, there were numerous plot holes and that Jon Hamm andJamie Foxx's roles got incredibly annoying and unbelievable as the filmwent on. This was also another film where you can tell the writer grewup rich and does not understand how working class people behave. Onepart in the movie, Baby works off his debt and just walks away tobecome a pizza delivery driver and Doc never says anything like, "Youexcited to make real money now?" There was just a lot about Baby thatreminded me more of a trust fund kid than a real lower-class personstruggling to make it.I just can't recommend this movie until it comes out on DVD. You'llthank me around the last third of the movie.
