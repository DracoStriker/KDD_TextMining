Not as good as the reviews would have you believe. But I still think it's probably a very cool film for teenagers. I think they might get avibe similar to what Grease did for us when we were teenagers. And that's high praise. Still not a good film for adults. We were expectingmore from a movie that has been said to be one of the best if not thebest movie of 2017.
