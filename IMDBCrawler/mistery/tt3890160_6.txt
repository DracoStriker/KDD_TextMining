I may have been more generous with the rating I chose, however due tothe overwhelming number of highly positive reviews, I feel that somebrutal honesty is required here.The main themes in most of the reviews I've stumbled across are thatthis movie has a refreshingly original story and that the car chasescenes were exceptional. Neither circumstance holds true. The story wasas cut and dry as any in this genre and the car chase scenes werebland, boring, and made no sense to me. Compared to a movie like Drive,where the protagonist's backstory actually lends to his driving skills(stunt car driver, motorsports participant), in Baby Driver, we'resupposed to believe that some kid somehow acquired exceptional getawaydriver abilities because of...tinnitus? There is no connection here,not to me anyway. And as for the chase scenes, utterly boring andunoriginal. The cars were completely lame too. Taking Drive as a pointof contention again, the cars in Drive even have some degree ofbackstory to make the seemingly unbelievable chase scenes morebelievable...upgraded chassis, suspension, and souped up engines. InBaby Driver, we're given nothing more than showroom stock grocerygetters...not even the top end models of the cars were chosen to takeon the challenges. It was just all around stupid to me and I was leftdisappointed.OK so the soundtrack was good. But this is not Forrest Gump where acompelling, original story is amplified by a perfectly curatedsoundtrack. Instead, it's a collection of good music used in campyfashion. If what you're after is the soundtrack, get a Spotify account.Dollar for dollar you'll get a lot more out of it, I promise.
