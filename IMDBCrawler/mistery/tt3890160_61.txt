Baby Driver is Edger Wrights new's Movie and I would say that it is upthere with the Cornetto trilogy and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World as hisbest films The Movie has an interesting rhythm and it feels that everything thathappens in the movie syncs up to the music. and thankfully the musicwas fantastic The action is well paced well shot with lots of wide angles and singletakes that's refreshing in a world where most big budget action moviesare shot awfully (I'm looking at you Mummy) The Movie also has a great sense of humor and never takes itself tooseriously and surprisingly for an action comedy, the movie had a great story thatwas very well toldmy only problem with the film was Jamie Foxx didn't do a good job withhis role but I can't explain that cause I don't want to spoil the moviein this review But that didn't ruin the movie at all for me
