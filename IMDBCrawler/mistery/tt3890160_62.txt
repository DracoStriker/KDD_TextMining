Woooow what an experience!!If you only watch one film at the cinema this year,so far,then this isdefinitely worth going for for that buzz you won't get from a homeviewing i guarantee! The marrying of sound, songs and visuals is of anoutstanding beauty and originality!If like me you enjoy the unrelenting excitement of the recent batch ofFast And Furious films then you will love this film too. And thissprinkles a bit more viciousness on top from its characters as well.This film is just cool as F@$%!The music chosen works brilliantly throughout.The car action is jaw dropping. The performances from all the cast aregreat, the only change i would have made was having Griff(Jon Bernthal)play the Bats character instead of Jamie Foxx. I found Jon Bernthal tobe way more menacing and threatening like the Bats role demanded, butthats not taking anything away from J.Foxx, he made it work too.I highly recommend this film for people in search of adrenaline pumpingcar action sequences, some pumping gun battles, some badass criminalcharacters in that pulp style and for people who don't mind a hint ofromance in the vein of films like True Romance, The Getaway, etc, as itworks brilliantly in this too.Highly original, never been done before and unless they do a sequelwill never be done again i reckon, so do yourself a favour and go watchit.10/10
