I went in this movie not knowing anything about it other than the factthat it was probably going to be a bank robbery type of movie. Now ithad that, but it was simplified. The action scenes had a comedic aspectto them that just didn't feel right to me along with a lot of actionhappening behind closed doors. It does make sense since he is a driverand can't see what's going on, but there was one scene where the camerapurposefully gets out of the way so we can't see. It really takes outthe suspense in everything, which would've added a whole lot more tothe movie.This movie could've been so much more had they not gone the comedicroute. Unfortunately though, nothing was believable because of that.You have cops coming out of nowhere and action scenes that areunrealistic. I guess a big mistake of mine is comparing it to the movieHeat, because that's what I was expecting from what little I knew. Itwas still a decent movie with an interesting story, but it falls shortbecause it resorted to comedy for the action sequences. If you go innot expecting Heat or A Dog Day Afternoon, you may enjoy it slightlymore than me.
