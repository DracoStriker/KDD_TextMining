Before even looking at what makes this film special, Baby Driveralready succeeds on its own as a hodgepodge of action, crime, heist,comedy, romance and drama that balances all elements pretty evenly anddeftly. The pacing is nearly perfect and it's very simple andstraightforward, but at the same time cleverly and engagingly plotted.What takes this film to a special place is a literally unprecedentedlevel of sound design detail. In several places, you can see elementsof the lyrics in the song interacting with background elements andextras in the scene backgrounds. Not only is pretty much every gun shotand door slam and overall action element rhythm-synced to theever-present soundtrack, but even less noticeable audio tricks fullyimmerse the audience in the shoes of our main character. For instance,in one dialogue-driven scene, the main character is listening to someother characters speak while keeping in one ear bud (headphone). I wassitting on the left hand side of the theater and the music seemedextremely faint, almost to where one can barely hear it. At first, Ithought some inconsiderate asshole in the audience had a phone gamewith an instrumental loop running, and then I realized: they have themusic turned down low and panned hard right as if we are hearing itexactly how the main character would. If this movie doesn't take theOscar for sound design, something is clearly wrong.The humor style and relentless pacing won't click with 100% of people,but I think the type of person that this film was intended for willlove the film and that it also has some crossover appeal to those thataren't big action fans, as well. It also helps that it effortlesslycovers so many bases in terms of defying genre conventions. Even theinclusion of certain genre clichés in this film feel more like a winkat the audience than a lack of creativity. Strongly recommended for allfans of action, comedy and music!
