The execution and quality of the film making was great, but overall Iquickly got bored watching this movie as none of the character'smotivations seemed realistic or made sense to me. The action sequenceswere great, but didn't do anything especially unique or carry anysuspenseful weight with the plot that I found myself yawning duringmuch of it. Perhaps it needed more shocking gore.The movie seemed to be a bit confused in its tone, mixing stylizedviolence with comedy and serious heist elements. It was set in arealistic world, but the characters and their motivations were not. Itfelt like it was trying to rekindle the essence of a Tarantino cool badguy heist film like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but missed themark. I found myself not believing the heist scenarios enough or havingenough of a stake in them. It needed a stronger overall macguffin.The use of Music was unique, but I would've have got more out of it ifmore obscure music was used, like what the GTA video game series doescurating amazing forgotten B-side gems from famous artists.I felt like Jamie Foxx's acting talent was a bit wasted, and the blandAtlanta backdrop seemed like a production budget restraint. I wonderwhat city was written in the original script? I doubt anyone writes forAtlanta. Rather than transporting us to a cool city that feels lived inand feels like a real location, this just felt like a boring block ofdowntown brick buildings to shoot car chases and shootouts in.I love most of Edgar Wright's other films, so I'm not sure why this wasso boring for me. It just didn't do anything new for me and willprobably be forgotten from my film memory years from now.
