I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. At first Ithought it was going to be another run of the mill cliché teen moviewith teenagers outsmarting the grownups. That is not the case at all.It's about a teen messing around with grownups and realizing he is outof his league and trying to GTFOH.This movie has star power with Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx and JonHamm; and they deliver the goods. The supporting cast also knocks itout of the park; but the real star is the soundtrack. I was jamming inmy seat.
