Similar to Dunkirk, this movie is overrated. But Dunkirk at least hassome good parts, but Baby Driver is a complete mess all around. 1. Themain guy Baby is irritating. Moronic 2000+ born kid with ear pods andglasses. A bit autistic, no charisma, no acting skills. Terrible 2. Theplot is a mess full of holes. Some guy (Spacey) rents a crew for hisdirty jobs. OK, I can live with this. But the escape scenes seem toeasy, you cant get away so easy from police these days. 3. The lovestory. OH MY GOD. Autistic kid and stupid waitress. No chemistrywhatsoever. They like music and that's it. Their plan is to get awayand listen to songs with word "Baby" in them??? 4. Motivation of maincharacters. We don't know much, but all the villains seem generic, wedon't know what Baby did to Spacey, we don't know why Foxx attackedundercover cops or why Spacey didn't told them that they were on hispayroll? We don't know why Foxx kills everyone in plain sight? 5.Music. Very bad actually. Irritating kid who you wanna slap and somekinda good but average music. Also this mix of musical+action doesn'twork. Absolute rubbish, I've walked away from cinema.
