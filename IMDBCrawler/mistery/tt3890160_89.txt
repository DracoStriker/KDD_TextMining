Enduring this movie was a pain - i mean literal physical pain. Predictable plot would be an understatement if there were any. Character motivations are non-existent. It's just a random mess of pointless violence in the universe where every police officer has an IQ of a carrot. The main protagonist is mix of typical "my mommy died" and "save the girl" motivations. Please - do everyone a favor. Don't watch this movie. Let Hollywood starve themselves to death. Maybe then they will move on from cookie cutter plots and characters. It's awful. But it will probably sit fine with 14-22 year old "Twilight" fans.
