Baby Driver is the newest film by director Edgar Wright, who is famousfor making some of the arguably best British comedies of all time withthe Three Flavours of Cornetto Trilogy. After a four-year break fromdirecting following the conclusion to the trilogy in the World's End,Wright resurfaces with 'Baby Driver', a worthy addition to hisfilmography. The film follows the story of 'Baby', a young man who works as agetaway driver for a mob boss to whom he owes a debt. Music is a hugepart of Baby's life and this is used as a central plot point: a lot ofthe time the music he listens to is used as the soundtrack and thescenes are filmed accordingly. This is a very ambitious and arguablyunique concept which Wright pulls off well and which helps to keep thefilm moving throughout. Wright went with a cast of mostly small-scale actors but with theaddition of the two stars Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. This combinationworks very well and all of them, especially Ansel Elgort (Baby),deliver very convincing performances.There is a good blend of tension and humour in the film and coupledwith Wright's unique and captivating cinematography it makes the film avery fun but at the same time engaging ride. Both the scripting and thepacing are good and the film does not get particularly boring at anypoint. However, the thing that undoubtedly stands out the most is thesoundtrack. Wright uses a kaleidoscope of different genres yet all thesongs seem to blend together seamlessly. From Egyptian reggae to Queen,from Hans Zimmer to Simon & Garfunkel, each song has its place and fitsperfectly into its respective scene. Baby's dancing performances,especially in the brilliant one-take shot at the beginning, only manageto add to the already great atmosphere created by the soundtrack.Overall, Baby Driver is one of Edgar Wright's best films to date andthrough a combination of great cinematography, good acting, humour anda unique, well applied soundtrack, it is most certainly a film worthseeing.
