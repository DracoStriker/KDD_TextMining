Baby Driver has a fantastic sense of momentum. From walking down ablock to evading the police in a high stakes chase, everything Babydoes is well choreographed and high impact. The opening heists serveboth as the best action sequences in the film, and as a clever framingtechnique to introduce a colorful and twisted cast of criminals.Unfortunately most every character in this film ends up revolving tooclose to the titular Baby, making them seem like mirrors for theprotagonist's ego, rather than fulfilling their potential as greatcharacters in their own right. This is my only real problem with thefilm. Lily James and CJ Jones seem crammed into the script only tosmile and repeatedly tell Baby how great he is, while Kevin Spacey alsohas an overabundance of ass kissing lines, although he delivers most ofthem with a scowl. What makes this all so infuriating is that whileBaby is a fun character, and his Tinnitus is wonderfully incorporatedinto the editing, he doesn't seem worthy of the fascination the scripthas with him. It is a fun joyride nonetheless, but I can't help butfeeling that if Baby Driver had utilized its excellent cast ofcriminals better, it could have been more than that.
