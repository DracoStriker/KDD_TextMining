I tried to make it through the whole movie. I made it to about the halfway point.... I just couldn't take the damn music anymore. I mean,there was legit maybe 30 seconds to 1 minute breaks between songs. If Iwanted to listen to music, I'd listen to music. If I wanted to see amovie full of music, I'd watch a musical. It might have received morestars if there was a version of the movie that didn't contain 90minutes of music over the audio of the actual movie.
