20 November 2017 Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight- Paddington 2. Three years after the amazing original movie Paddingtonbursts back onto our screen. Full of good intentions, his naivety landshim in hot water and he finds himself locked up with everyone trying toclear his name. All our old favourites are back, Hugh Bonneville as MrBrown, Julie Walters as Mrs Bird and Peter Capaldi as Mr Curry amongothers, however I think the real human star of the show was Hugh Grant,who played the dastardly Phoenix Buchanan with aplomb. Phoenix is awashed up actor reduced to doing dog food commercials who takesadvantage of Paddington and makes you want to yell Boo Hiss from theaudience. There is some brilliant acting from everyone who isinteracting with Paddington, you wouldn't know there wasn't a realtalking bear there. A great film for all the family to enjoy, oh andstay sat down for the credits on this one!!!
