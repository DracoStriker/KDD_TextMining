I've got nothing against the film Dunkirk or its important place in thehistory of the world in standing up to tyranny. It's just that as soonas Nigel Farage suggested that every British schoolboy should watch it,I decided not to go.I'd suggest watching Paddington 2 instead. Its message is thattolerance, immigration and difference are good things.The film itself is lovely. The story doesn't stack up quite as well asthe first one, but each individual scene is gorgeous. Where NicoleKidman was evil as the baddie, Hugh Grant is self obsessed andbumbling.The sets are beautifully done. I kept thinking of Wes Anderson and TheGrand Budapest Hotel. The scene with Paddington exploring a pop up bookis probably the best of the lot. The humour is excellent.
