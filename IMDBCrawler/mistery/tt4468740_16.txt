I watched and enjoyed the first Paddington movie but have to say that ,unusually for a sequel, this is better. I found all the characters soendearing, the story was fantastic, a great number of cameos, and hatsoff to the actors all great. Beware, a hankie may be needed during thisfilm, and I have to say, best movie I have seen this year. Wonderfulfamily movie.
