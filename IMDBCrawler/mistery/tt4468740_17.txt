So in someone's fantasy, we Brits are a bunch of tartan and tweedwearing grim people who are predominantly white unless you're thegarbage collector or in prison. We sound stuck up, have no sense ofhumour, have horrendous teeth, are severely lacking in the departmentof looks or imagination and live on a diet of sugar and sweets. Thatdreaded afternoon tea in a gilded tea cup that I'm sick to the stomachof seeing in movies!!!! A nice tourist movie that will maid Burberryproud. What a bore! I think it's for kids and the parents who don'twant youngsters to ask any questions and probably lead a brain numbinglife happily ever after. And Hugh Grant was dreadful.
