I loved "Paddington" and - to my delight - I loved "Paddington 2" too.Of course, we start with the adorable character created by Michael Bond(who died between the release of the two films), the brilliant CGIrepresentation of our furry friend, and the purr-fect voicing by BenWishaw. This is such a British franchise with so very many Britishcharacter actors (OK, and one Irish) and so many London locations,although this is the kind of gentle London that we saw in "NottingHill" (most notably in the prison scenes). Indeed the villain this timeis less threatening than Nicole Kidman's character in the first filmand played brilliantly by the ever-so- English star of "Notting Hill",Hugh Grant, who - following his success in "Florence Foster Jenkins" -shows that he is not just a pretty face.The film is endlessly inventive, not least in bringing to life a pop-upbook of London landmarks which is at the heart of the plot, and it isstuffed full of visual gags as well as so many funny lines, a few aimedat adult viewers rather than little ones. My granddaughter (almostseven) found it delightful with one of her favourite scenes beingPaddington's window-cleaning efforts. Be sure to stay for the credits -a final delight in 100 happy minutes.
