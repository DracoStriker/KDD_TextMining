For starters ..I have given a 10 for this as a family movie and nothingelse.As family movies go you won't get better. A delight from start tofinish with everything you could possiblywant...fun..comedy...romance...heist..slapstick....drama..danger.....baddies..robbery ...everything. Everybody hams it up perfectly..and also some of the direction andanimation is actually very awesome.Perfect family trip to the cinema here for young and old.One thing to add...in the drama of the Weinstien troubles...someexpected a boycott here..nothing of it at all..the theatre was rammedat every showing..I don't know what that tells us but I thought it wasworth mentioning!!
