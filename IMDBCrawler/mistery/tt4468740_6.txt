Paddington 2 really is a fine children's movie. In fact, I would go asfar as to say one of the best children's movies I have seen. It is notjust charm and whimsy and genuine laughs though it has those in buckets- it is a real plot, and a solid caper movie to boot. By building on aningenious crime element and real plotting it has turned from asentimental journey to something more. As an avid reader of the booksas a child, the main worry is the spirit of the bear who believes inthe good in everyone, while creating untold chaos around him, will getlost to serve the storyline or some idea of updating Paddington.Luckily, none of the spirit is lost, and instead, we have an immenselyenjoyable, fun, funny, and charming film. The whole family loved it -and we all laughed, cried, and cheered. Just be sure to stay seated forthe credits. A really excellent children's film.
