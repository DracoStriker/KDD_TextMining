This is a CGI animated film sequel of the charming bear charactercalled Paddington, the bear who always looks for the good in people. Inthis film we see that one year on from the original film Paddington hasreally become part of the Brown family and very much part of the localcommunity. Paddington is looking for the perfect present for his Auntie Lucy's100th birthday, he sees a pop-up book in an antique shop, but it's veryexpensive (£500). None-the-less, he decides to buy it as his Auntieonly ever wanted to see London, so this seems perfect. Paddington needsto do a string of different odd jobs to earn the necessary money to buythe book, all with disastrous slap-stick comedy consequences. The bookalso provides clues to the location of some treasure. Late one night Paddington witnesses the book being stolen from theshop, he chases the villain but he escapes. The police arrive on thescene and have no alternative but to convict Paddington, the Brownfamily need to clear Paddington's name and find the thief. Whilst in prison, which is colourful and largely resembles The GrandBudapest Hotel, Paddington makes friends with several of the eccentricinmates, his exchanges with them are all hilarious including some useof the famous 'hard stare'. Paddington manages to break out with threeother inmates, they (and the Browns) are now in pursuit of the bookthief. Of course they catch the devious thief, and recover the book. Go see this gem of a film, generally better than the original with awho's who cast of British acting royalty, and an emotional ending. Stay for the closing credits for a comedy dance sequence. Very highlyrecommended.
