I took my 7 year old son to see this film and we had a great time. Hewas laughing out loud at the animals and their antics. There is a scarysoldier that was pursuing Mary and Joseph, but not too scary. If youare interested in the traditional Christmas story for yourfamily...this is just the ticket. Great animation. Funny characters.Happy and uplifting. I wish they would make more kids movies likethis!!!
