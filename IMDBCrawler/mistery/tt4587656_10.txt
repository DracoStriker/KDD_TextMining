Set in "nine months B.C.," "The Star" is a gentle and affectionately-irreverent computer-animated retelling of The Nativity, as seen throughthe eyes of a clumsy and accident-prone donkey and his friends as theyaccompany Mary and Joseph on their journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem.With animation by Cinesite in collaboration with The Jim HensonCompany? Cinesite provided the special effects for several of therecent hits from Marvel Entertainment, and the Hensons are the peoplebehind The Muppets?"The Star" mostly abounds with mild slapstick, asanimal characters support each through mildly perilous situations ontheir way to the very first Christmas pageant.Along with his friends, the donkey?named "Boaz" by Mary, or Bo forshort ?seeks to protect the Holy Family from King Herod's RomanCenturion hit- man and his two ferocious hounds, occasionallyencountering along the way the camels transporting the Three Wise Menalong a parallel path to the same event. Bo is also trying to elude his disgruntled owner, from whom he recentlyescaped chasing dreams of glory. Mary and Joseph are unaware of thedangers of their journey, due partly to Bo's inability to communicatebeyond the elaborate comic pantomime which sometimes earns him a belly-rub from Mary.Possibly "The Star" with its gentle humor, colorful characters, andsuperb animation works best as a means of introducing small children tothe story of the first Christmas. And the picture receives considerablehelp from its all-star assembly of voice talent, including Steven Yeunas Boaz, supported by Keegan-Michael Key, Kelly Clarkson, Aidy Bryantfrom television's SNL, Patricia Heaton, Kristin Chenoweth, KrisKristofferson, and Ving Rhames. The unlikely team of Tyler Perry, Oprah Winfrey, and the wonderfulTracy Morgan are heard as the bickering camels transporting the ThreeWise Men, Christopher Plummer voices Herod, and Zachary Levi and GinaRodriguez are the frequently-harried Joseph and his practical butplayfully affectionate young wife, Mary.The picture itself has received mixed reviews?Rotten Tomatoes reports a62% approval rating from 26 critics, with an average score of 5.2 outof 10?but audiences polled by CinemaScore give "The Star" an averagegrade of A. That's the only score that really matters. "The Star" is appropriatefor viewing by all audiences, but is especially recommended for thevery young.
