It was a VeggieTales movie minus the veggie tales and stuffed fulled ofmisinformation, sappy morals, and a sleep-inducing soundtrack.The entire plot revolves around the "first Christmas" which of courseinvolved talking animals, a musical number and a boring plot aboutfinding a place for the "virgin" Mary to deliver her baby.Likely worth it when it finds it's way to the bottom of the 3$ bin atWalmart.
