People are voting too low, and criticize too much. This is just ananimation, and I think its target customers are children and families.But I still went to watch because I found the trailer was interestingand funny. In another way, the movie was even better than myanticipated because the rating is too low on the IMDb. So I do enjoythe movie, and I am not shamed to tell that I like a cartoon movie. TheStar's story line is clear, and charters are funny, nothingcomplicated. Also, the CGI work is fine and smooth, and I like alltheir Christmas and church songs.The movie is taking side from the animal, nothing too much about Jesus,it is not a religious topic movie.
