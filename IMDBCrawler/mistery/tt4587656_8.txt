My kids and I completely enjoyed this film! To be honest, I wasn'texpecting much, I thought it was just gonna be yet another animatedretelling of the first Christmas, but was much better than that! Thejokes and gags are actually hilarious and will make kids and grown upsalike burst with laughter. I like that this tells the story of thefirst Christmas from the perspective of the animals. That makes itdifferent and something I have not seen before. Artistic license isused a lot of course, but I think they stuck to the spirit of the storyand kept the most important biblical details in there, while stillmaking it lots of fun!
