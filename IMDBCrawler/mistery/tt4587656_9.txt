Praying donkey? This just wow. Like an angel who talk with bunch ofsheep's (they show shepherds, but... he talk to the sheep's anyway). Ortwo atheistic camels. I mean, with all this - its anyway not bad filmfor normal kids. But send this Christian message? No. Its more likeinsult for christians (with jokes about kiss my feathers), than dosomething for propaganda their ideas. When Bo say "donkey kick" itsobviously was "donkey punch", because all we know how Sony animatedfilms filled with memes. Good one but not in a kid movie AGAIN. And itsreally "sweet" when in 6+ talk so many about killing babes and others.I think in this rating don't really necessary use words like "dead","death" and "kill". And its really strange when you start film for kidsfrom such disturbing scene like impregnation of Maria. But, anyway likekids movie for Christmas its good, have funny moments, looks likepromising successor for "Open Season" with better graphics. Cant wait 6or 7 DTV releases - keep donkey and friend, but put Bible away. Maybethey can go through other fairy tales.
