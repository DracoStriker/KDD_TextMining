'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has everything fans of the first filmcould have possibly wanted and more. Action, humour and special effectsare all in abundance and visually it's very impressive. The plot isdecent, especially for a sequel, but it never quite reaches the samelevel as the first film. The British/American theme works well thoughand there are some very funny cultural jokes and references.As someone who loved the first 'Kingsman', I'm pleased that the sequeldidn't disappoint. It remains true to everything that made the firstfilm such a success, including taking some big risks and thinking outof the box. The end result is an imperfect and at times messy film, buta rewarding and highly entertaining one nonetheless. 'The GoldenCircle' is much better than expected but just not quite on the samelevel as the first film.
