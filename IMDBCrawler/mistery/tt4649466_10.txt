If a movie would ever be produced to show the backstory of the RogerMoore version of James Bond?what his childhood was like, and how hebecame who he was?that movie would probably closely resemble 2015's"Kingsman: The Secret Service." Under Moore's stewardship, the Bond series drifted toward a criticalnadir, growing progressively more silly and ineffectual until by theend the pictures were little more than parlor comedies with niftygadgets and occasional off-color gags?in other words, much like"Kingsman."Based on a series of comic books, the primary similarity between thefirst "Kingsman" movie and its sequel is in the quality of the humor?sophomoric. But the first picture had the advantage of being innovative?its immediate focus was to introduce and establish the characters,which it did in an acceptably entertaining fashion. The actual story,such as it was, became of secondary importance.In "Kingsman: The Golden Circle," the level of maturity is about thesame as in the first. The difference with "Kingsman 2" is that when agag is set up, if there's a choice between aiming high toward genuinewit or aiming low toward a cheap laugh, the script will invariablyfollow the low road.And that's only when there's a payoff at all?there are plenty ofset-ups in "Kingsman 2" which lead nowhere, as if the filmmakers forgotwhere they were going, or that their primary purpose was to entertainthe audience instead of simply amusing themselves.This problem extends to the casting: After the first "Kingsman" pictureearned over $414 million in worldwide revenues, the studio raised thebudget of the second installment by over $20 million. Much of thebudget was presumably spent on luring a number of veteran AcademyAward- winning motion picture actors to the series?Julianne Moore,Halle Berry, and Jeff Bridges are among the familiar faces joining the"Kingsman" cast for the second installment. But apparently after the expense of paying for the extra acting talent,little or no money remained to invest in developing the story or thescreenplay for the actors to work with. This problem is especiallyapparent in the picture's third act, which dissolves into a melee ofsenseless, violent silliness.As in the first picture, "Kingsman: The Golden Circle" embraces thesort of cartoonish brutality familiar to fans of videogames.Considering the picture's unfunny gags, unpersuasive effects, absenceof a compelling plot, and lethal overlength?a totally unnecessary 141minutes?"Kingsman" time passes slowly indeed. Even the old Roger Moore James Bond pictures were better than this.
