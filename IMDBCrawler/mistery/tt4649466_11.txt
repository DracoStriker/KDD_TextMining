This idiotic mess assumes that the whole world is in to recreationaldrugs the writers of this bum numbing epic seem to think, they shouldget out of Hollywood more often. They also assume that the F word isalways funny as they just stack one uttering on the other, over andover.On every level this expensive syrup honks to the core.It is all inthe trailer which mercifully was two and a half minutes not two hourstwenty one, in true turkey style the film is packed with big namestaking big cheques that means they don't care that they haveembarrassed there career.All the jokes nods and satire's fall splatflat, then there is the action which is hardly exciting as all is sovastly over the top.Exactly how anyone can imagine there is 221 minutesof entertainment in this grim, dare i say blockbuster is beyondme.Judging by the rustling of feet and popcorn around me this movie wasnot hitting many targets.The pit was reached when sir Elton John filledthe screen from corner to corner yelling F-F-F. It has been i am toldthe worst summer at the north American box office in 20 years andlittle wonder it has been a summer season filled with tired labouredsequels, prequels, reboots, and remakes all lacking originality andlittle in the way of skilled film making, this Kingsmen debacle simplytops of a doomed industry.Who must go back to film school and learnreal film making,with real story's, it does not take $200 million apop, but it does take talent.Not F's!
