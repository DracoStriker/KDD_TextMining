After seeing the trailers for the sequel, I was worried that it wouldnot be able to hold a candle to the first film, which I thought wassuperb. The long running time also had me slightly concerned.As it turned out, there was no need to worry, as I really enjoyed thefilm. Time flew by and the story line kept me hooked the whole waythrough! Eggsy is a brilliant character and is for me personally, thestar of the show, with Merlin coming a close second. Elton John's cameowas also brilliant and provided much laughter.If you looking for a film that will keep you entertained, provideplenty of action and a barrel of laughs then give this a go.
