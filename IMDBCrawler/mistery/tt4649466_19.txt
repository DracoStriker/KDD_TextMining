I loved the first Kingsman movie. The over the top action, the comedyand of course the (main) characters. So I was really excited for thismovie. And does it live up?Yeah! It's not a masterpiece of any kind but it's a great sequel andactually how I wanted it. It has the same vibe as the original butsimultaneity adds new elements to the table. Exactly how a sequelshould be done! But how does it hold up to the original?Well, the characters has much more to them in this movie and it doeshave some emotional scenes. However I did feel the villain was kindaweak. Valetine whilst the way he talked was kinda annoying, actuallyhad some charm. I did not feel like the new one had. Instead it's moreof a over-the top villain you find in the James Bond movies. However Ithink it's better to have main characters with depth and a villainwithout instead of having the opposite. So they are pretty equal butThe Golden Circle is slightly better.Overall I think it's a great movie. If you want a goofy, fun movie withgreat action and humor I do really recommend it. If you're going intothis movie expecting a masterpiece I think you will be somewhatdisappointed. But if you're just going into the movie just have somefun, I think you will!8/10
