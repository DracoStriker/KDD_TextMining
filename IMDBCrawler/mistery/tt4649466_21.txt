Stylish and suave as before, Kingsman: The Golden Circle skates by withgreat action and characters. It's not quite as fresh, but just asawesome. The Good: Still hilarious and inventive, with awesome gadgetsgalore. The Bad: It's overlong, with an even goofier plot than thefirst film. The first Kingsman may be hard to live up to, but TheGolden Circle almost gets there. A fun and exciting spy movie worth thewatch, especially if you liked the first.
