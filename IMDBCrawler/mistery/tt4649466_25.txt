Now Kingsman:The Secret Service was a pleasant surprise for everyonewho saw the film, and obviously, a sequel was definitely gonna be made,here we have The Golden Circle. Now, all in all, the film is not asgood as the first, and it does feel longer than it should be, maybe if20 minutes were cut out, it'd be perfect, however, it's not as bad aspeople are saying, for example 51% on Rotten Tomatoes, is rubbish. Thefilm has good performances all round, Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridgesare not in the film as much as I expected, and Julianne Moore's rolefelt forced in a way, but what really lifts the film, are the over-the-top action sequences. This time around, they go all out with theaction, on to a degree where it's physically impossible, and most ofthe times the CGI will distract some. All in all, the film is not asgood as the first, but better than expected, and there is a role playedby a famous singer, which I will not spoil. Overall:7/10
