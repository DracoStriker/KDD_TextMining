It's essentially all a big joke played on those who took umbrage at thefew select sexualised moments from the final act of the first film, ajoke whereby everything is consistently ramped up to eleven regardlessof its negative impact on the story in a standoffish move meant tofurther separate the apparent 'critics' from the so-called 'fans', amove that only successfully provides both categories with a much worseexperience, because while I and many other 'fans' didn't mind (or atleast excused) the passive, clearly satirical crude jests andoccasional absurdity of the original picture, we certainly didn't wanta follow-up based entirely around what would obviously be consideredthe weakest aspects of the piece - elements which were only mitigatedby the joyous fun found in the brilliance of the other parts such asthe subtle yet witty satire and the very well developed characters,pieces of the puzzle now missing; though it is at times passivelyentertaining, what we're left with is a fairly by-the-numbers'save-the-world' plot and a string of odd action set- pieces seeminglyincompetently put together, with abhorrent use of rampant speed-ramping making it literally look like someone hit the fast-forwardbutton and haphazardly stitched-together short takes that are supposedto make some sequences look like one fluid shot but instead make themlook like cheap cartoons - in his quest to ignore the naysayers, Vaughndisappointingly squanders all of the good-will he had built with hispredecessor and bizarrely wipes the slate clean relatively early on,wasting time setting up a less interesting new set of charactersinstead of working with the better characters already expertlyestablished at the end of the prior title, while also reintroducing apreviously dead character (seen in the trailers), after making him anamnesiac no less, in a move that should be reserved only for a waningfranchise at least five films in that's struggling to maintain it'srelevancy, not for what was once perhaps the most promising newproperty in Hollywood. 6/10
