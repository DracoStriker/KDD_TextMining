I went to see this with friends and my girl. We all agreed that it wascool. Loads of funny rofl moments and kick-ass action packed scenes.Mainly a story about honorable iconic agents working f*** hard to fightfor justice and defend/protect citizens during dark terror situations.Heroism without all the cool mutant powers of some other movies, lol.
