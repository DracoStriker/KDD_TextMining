What can I say, absolutely dreadful, this is what happens when you havea big budget with zero story, a movie filled with some decent actionsequences in between cliché after cliché, tack on an antidrug messageand you have Kingsman: The Golden Circle, the irony being you'd have tobe high as a kite to appreciate anything this movie has to offer.it'sdisappointing when you consider the first Kingsman was actually adecent movie but what ever magic the first movie had is now well andtruly dead and buried.
