I watched this movie with my cinema-employed friend having not seen theprevious ep made before this one. It didn't matter as some of it wasexplained as the picture went on and much of the action set pieces wereentertaining enough for me to not care too much if I occasionally gotconfused. Oh, and there's a famous Music Star who appears throughoutmuch of it to make it even more enjoyable especially as I know it's myfriend's favorite singer. So that's my recommendation of Kingsman: TheGolden Circle.
