1(awful).... Actually that is a KIND rating, but there's no option fora negative rating so I went as low as I could. Simply stated, I went tothis film on the basis of its prequel which while not great, wasentertaining. This film is so STUPID and poorly written that I'mfrankly astonished that any of the "talent" hired to play the roles,agreed to do it at all lest their resumes be thoroughly sullied. I'vewalked out of 3 or 4 movies in my life. Tonight I added another. Don'twaste your time unless you enjoy AWFUL films and you're a cinematicmasochist. My time would have been better spent sorting socks.
