Don't pay attention to the negative reviews from the critics. They arejust snobs and power hungry. This is a well done and entertaining film.I don't know how well it will do in the United States. The firstKingsman film did better overseas then in the U.S. I saw the first onetwice, but will not see this one two times. As an American, I found theheavy handed anti American/Trump mania distasteful. I don't go to thiskind of film to hear the Office of the Presidency disparaged. Nor doesbeing an American make me evil incarnate. The filmmaker and actors havea European opinion that we are all ugly Americas if you don't agreewith their politics. The target audience, which is 12- 18 year oldboys, will not even notice the political propaganda, but their parents,who pay for their tickets and accompany them to this R Rated film will.
