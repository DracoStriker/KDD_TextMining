I was absolutely disappointed by the severe violence the 2nd Kinsmanmovie showed. I know I can't mention the scene, because it can spoilthe movie. But I am sure the directors and the writers can figure outwhich scenes I am taking about. I understand that people like someexcitement, cool fight scenes and modern fighting gadgets and tools,but these violent scenes didn't have anything to do with that. We are all aware that movie industry has a huge huge impact on people'sthoughts, mental patterns and how they live and view the world. And itis sad to see that the cool Kingsman 1, turned to this movie thatimplants severe violence in people's minds. I hope we are all responsible for what impact we have on each other onthis planet.
