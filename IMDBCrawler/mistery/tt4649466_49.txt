From the moment, I had watched Kingsman: The Secret Service (FirstEdition), I was very eager and waited for its sequel, Kingsman: TheGolden Circle. After watching the trailer, I was very sure that it willbe an action packed edition and will be as cool as its predecessor.The car chase at the beginning sets the tone for the movie whichswitches gear and goes at full throttle leaving you amazed. The actionsequences are portrayed in the best possible manner and the entirestunt team should be given great accolades for their effort.If you had watched the first edition, you will find many sequencessimilar to them, especially the famous bar fight (Manners Maketh theMan) but with a twist in the sequence!!! With a truck load ofsuperstars, (Channing Tatum, Halle Berry, Julianne Moore, Jeff Bridges,Pedro Pascal and more) added to this edition, the director has ensuredto give justice to each of the actors giving them the screen presence.Especially, the action sequences involving Pedro Pascal and his Lassois spectacular and awesome!!!Also, the humor content in the movie is absolutely terrific and is muchrequired. The dialogues are pretty much filled with wit and humor, theexchanges between each one of the stars are worth every minute. Getready to watch Elton John in the most colorful performance ever!!!Whiskey, Tequila, Ginger Ale, Champagne ? I am not listing my favoritedrinks but these are the character names of the cast in the movie!!!I am very much sure there is another edition coming up to this and I amvery much looking forward for the 3rd installment of the Kingsman!!!The movie does justice to its first edition and falls in the actiongenre. If you would like to watch a movie and spend time, then this isthe movie to go. No need to think, just grab a drink and box of popcornand enjoy the ride!!!Manners Maketh Man ? Action Maketh Kingsman!!!!
