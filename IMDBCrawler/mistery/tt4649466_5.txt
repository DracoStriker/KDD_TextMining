I found the golden circle to be a bit too cliché in some parts, and theantagonist's role to be somewhat forced. There was plenty of goodaction and humor though with awesome references to the first movie. Foranyone considering watching this who hasn't seen the first part, pleasemake sure you see it first so you're much more "in" on what's happeningwith this one.
