My friends and I wanted to see a fun movie for a change. We neededsomething to distract us and laugh in part to cheer me up. I found whatI needed in the story and mainly in the character Eggsy, he made mesmile. Made me confident that men can treat ladies well. The actorTaron is super cute too, don't usually go for guys like him ;)Channning was amazing too, he should have danced more lol Plus theeffects and fight/action choreography were tight and unexpected. Thisexciting movie successfully changed my grim mood!
