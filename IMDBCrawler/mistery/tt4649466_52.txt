I only went to this movie because my kids were excited to see it. Wow,just too dumb for words. And so retro, and not in a good way. Everyfemale character either sits behind a computer or is there for windowdressing. And such a waste of the monumental talents of Julianne Moore.It very much has the feel of the Bond movies of the past, and I don'tmean that as a compliment: the men race around, magically dodgingbullets, while the women wear sexy clothing and make goo-goo eyes atthe big strong men. WTH? I have to rewatch Wonder Woman just to get thebad taste out of my mouth. And the laws of physics do not apply to thisuniverse, wherever it is. I know it's escapism, but it's the worstpossible kind. I really thought that we had entered a new era of actionmovies, with a more nuanced take on plots, character development, andrelationships. This movie is a dinosaur. Bleh. I gave the movie 2 stars- one for the weird but delightful presence of Elton John (and greatuse of his music), and one for the weird anti anti-drug message and themocking of a foolish, small-minded president.
