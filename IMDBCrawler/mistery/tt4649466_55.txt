Okay...so Kingsman: The golden circle goes wild wild west.Again, kingsman doesn't fail to amuse the audience.Is it as good as the first one? well it is as creative and fun! butsequels rarely surpass the original.Think of the movie as if will smith's wild wild west and I-robot had ababy.Nevertheless, charming storyline and cast.
