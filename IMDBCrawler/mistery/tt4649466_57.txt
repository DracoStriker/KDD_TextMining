Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a fun and action packed sequeldelivering on the success of the first film. The film combines Britishstyle with American swagger and certainly doesn't pull any punches bothupdating the spy genre and being a parody of it.The film begins with a brilliant and heart pounding action sequencewhich immediately sets the tone of the film. The action sequences arevery consistent throughout the duration of the movie and with anEnglish action director like Matthew Vaughn I would expect nothingless. Kingsman 2 is very enjoyable and is an excellent film if you just wantto sit back and watch an amusing film that doesn't take itself tooseriously. However, I would say that the film has been highlyAmericanised for a mass market. This is a positive and a negative. Itis a positive as we get a lot of excellent American/Englishman banter.However, that being, said an aspect of the original film's charm islost. The acting is in general very good with Taron Egerton returning asEggsy, once again delivering an assured and confident performance. Oldfavourites also return to the cast along with a few new members eachgiving first-rate performances. Julianne Moore stars as a megalomaniacvillain called Poppy. The character is a caricature of an archetypalvillain but because of the film's light and humorous tone this doesn'tmatter too much as the movie is just so much fun. Overall, the film is a really entertaining and although it isn't quiteas good as the original, it is still definitely a worthy sequel.Kingsman: The Golden Circle incorporates brilliant British humour whichis packaged up for American audiences. I would give the film 7 out of10.
