The buzz appears split on this film. It shouldn't be. It's really fun.A bit violent, but fun! It's well written with humor coming from jokesin the first film mirroring in this. Anyone who saw the first willenjoy it that much more, but the film stands alone as well. Just ahumors action adventure film.
