I must admit I kinda waited for this movie because I liked the approachin the first movie and I thought they will stick to their flow and comeup with something newer and greater but their sequel failed to deliver.The movie was just a chaotic. In the beginning they flushed bunch of characters with useless bombsand left in the characters who, they thought, will entertain audiencethe most. Did they? Not really. Jokes were mostly worn-out andcharacters lacked of depth and stayed very one-dimensional. I can'teven name one character who stood out because they developed NONE. Themovie was also lacking of pressure and bad guys having power overeverything making good guys having really hard time.What were those action scenes? There were no impressive and new moveswhich i was kinda waiting for and even their technology seemed very "ihave seen this somewhere". Also, cinematography had some issues- I kinda noticed that the imagewas more shaky and blurry that it should have been. For this budget Iexpect better quality.Honesty, I have no idea where my 3 stars come from. It just feels wrongto give it lower rating as I see the average is kind of high.
