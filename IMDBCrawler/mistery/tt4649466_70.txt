This is not review but some info about movie.These days all sequel has this Biggest Flaw. There are overused plotfrom first movie. Just like Guardians of the galaxy here also So manycheap jokes and at very very wrong time. (some spoilers ahead)Starting and ending of movie is action packed and very good. Rest arecrap & boring story is just OK. They used so many cheap jokes. That scene when Kingsmen's all locations destroyed and they promiseeach other not to cry like b**** & take revenge but then there is funpart and they start drinking beer. Feels great when action starts but same time that funny guy (singer)started fighting with bad guys. You can't do both action and cheap funat same time. People can't focus on both things. When there is seriousscene, Don't ruin it.Everyone in theater started cheering when there is similar scene fromfirst when Harry Hart closes door teaching about respect and startsfighting but here, he fails and they made fun of him. was thisnecessary? Fans start expecting good actions and exactly at same timemovie team adds funny part.Plot was not good. Blue rash appears. victims starts dancing. Usingantidote rash disappears instantly. Butterflies flying Scenes. Really?:( All bullshit.Villain Poppy is also not live upto expectation. always keeps smilingand making fun of everyone. Doesn't feel like villain at all.All over you may enjoy it one time but won't ask for second time.Easily Forgettable. First part will be remembered for long time.
