This film tells the story of a group of private secret agents, who haveto find out and destroy a plot to kill millions of people throughpoisoned illegal drugs."Kingsman: The Golden Circle" is really everything. It is bloody andviolent, but funnily enough these events actually induce laughs. Thewonderful gadgets they have are reminiscent of James Bond, but in thisfilm it's just more stylish, an a hint of outrageousness that makes ithilarious and adrenaline pumping at the same time. The lead charactersare charismatic and very handsome. They look super smart in theirsuits. The fights are really cool, very choreographed to the point ofgetting me amazed by what I see in the screen. It's got many big namestoo, and even Elton John who provides much comic relief. In short, Ienjoyed every second of this film. It's a blockbuster that haseverything to please the crowd.
