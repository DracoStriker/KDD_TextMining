The first Kingsman was very good and the second part didn't disappointeither. The action and effects were comparable with the first movie butthink the story of the second movie was not that good. The movie had anice pace of action from start to end and the acting was very good.In the first movie Samual L. Jackson was outstanding as the bad guy butthink this movie lacked someone like that.
