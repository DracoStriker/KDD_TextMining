It wasn't the predictable bad-guy-from-the-first-movie thing. It wasn'tthe A-lister-is campy-bad-guy shtick. i love spy-movies. i know what'sgoing to happen and i don't care - i love the action, the swanky spy,the "evil" bad guy, the preposterous plan of world domination.oh, i know. it was the fact that the Americans were named after liquorinstead of-oh, i dunno... STATESMEN!? The kingsmen are not named aftertailors. it's not Ralph Lauren and Dolce and Gabbana. they are namedafter he legendary Knights of the round table. the characters ofhonour, loyalty, and leadership. the Americans, on the other hand, arenamed -not after the many many statesmen/women or great cowboys thathelped our good country - but for the many types of booze we encounter.what a let down. i was SO stoked to see it and was disappointed howover camped this film was. there is a fine line "reality" in spymovies. no matter how insane - play it straight and it works. as soonas you let the kitsch overrun the camp, it becomes a farce instead of ahomage or pastiche. also, Brits don't know how to write Americanswithout making them look like red-neck idiots. (on the other hand,Americans can't write a British part without making them look snobby -see the Avengers 1998)
