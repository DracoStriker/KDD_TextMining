Straight to the point, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a good movie,with some great action scenes, beautiful character moments and amazingphotography. But has some problems too.Starting with the good points. The movie bring once again the belovedcharacters from the first one (even Harry), and they (of course) areamazing. Eggsy is charismatic as always, Harry is (in one part of themovie) the elegant gentleman of the first movie, and even Merlin getmore time in the screen this time. Besides that the movie has someamazing action scenes, and funny moments, that really hold the audienceto the history. Some scenes between Harry and Eggsy really warmed myheart too.But the movie isn't just flowers and happiness, it has some problemstoo. The thing that most bother me at first was some of the specialeffects. Some scenes have so much chroma key on it that really take youout of the movie, and in the most part of those scenes, the effectsaren't even necessary (aka all the shots in the stadium). Some actionsscenes fall in that same mistake too. The characters did somethingsthat really bother me at some point too, because I think that thisisn't the way that they will act in those situations.Well, in short, I believe that Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a goodmovie, in some parts it falls in some clichés of the big franchises,but in a bigger picture still a fun and very entertaining movie.
