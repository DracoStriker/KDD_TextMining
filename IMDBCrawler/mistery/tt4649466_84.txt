I've perused sundry downbeat reviews of "Kingsman: The Golden Circle",read the lot, and drearily trudged into the experience of viewing thesequel. Expectations were moderate, poise was relaxed, and bare feetwere atop the coffee table. When the movie concluded, I felt myprognosis was shattered. The movie plays to the slow- motion,flip/flop/f*ck-em-up crowd that has kept many franchises afloat, butthis brownie seems fully baked to decadence. The "Dukes of Hazzardmeets Get Smart meets The Avengers (the Steed and Peel program)" vibeis affable now that James Bond has outlived his usefulness. I regret Iwield the remorseless temerity to articulate that antipathy for 007,but the incontrovertible reality stands that "Kingsman" receives thecrown and doesn't spoil the lineage for the British Espionage/Actiongenre. Bond has nestled into ennui. "Kingsman" succeeds with JulianneMoore as the villainess, perhaps conjured from a lost episode of the1960s Batman TV program (minus the tilted frame). She's a goof, andshe, too, is shameless. Channing Tatum's participation is peripheral;however, he proves integral to the future of the franchise. The movieis not quite "Big and Dumb" like those "Mission: Impossible" moviesbecause it does not have an ego like Tom Cruise tainting theproduction. Colin Firth plays his role equitably, Mark Strong ismeritorious, and even Jeff Bridges has a chuckle. They've earned theirdowntime as grander schemes await. "Kingsman: The Golden Circle" issimply a very good movie because it delivers on its promises of keepingyou distracted with sugary breakfast cereal and John Denver songs soyou don't notice that every other aspect of true life is not worth thewaking moments. Watch the movie, then sleep. We'll wake you for"Geostorm"; I trust you wouldn't be able to sleep through that, anyway.
