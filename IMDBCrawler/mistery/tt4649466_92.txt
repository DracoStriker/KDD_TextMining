Although this review might not 'seem' to relate to the film - it is, inactuality an overall review of several titles that have the same corevalues.So, here we are again (apparently)... you know, the Americans savingthe day - or more familiarly, saving the Brits.Yes... the Americans won the 1st and 2nd World Wars - of course, the USdidn't enter the first world war until 1917 (it started in 1914, by theway - and, up until their 'rescue' they'd been selling arms to bothsides of the conflict with huge financial gain)That aside, they 'rescued' the Brits again during the 2nd World War,which started in 1939 but didn't see a US face until late 1941. Once again, before entering the conflict, the US had been selling arms(to multiple sides this time) - hey... 'It's all about the money..money..' (i think that's how the song goes).But.. we should, by now, have gotten used Americas re-writing ofHistory - I mean, didn't they manage to capture the 'Enigma Machine' -responsible for the saving of countless lives? It must be true - I sawMatthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton in it!But all of the above baffles me... because truly, the US really doeshave many, many good things to take credit for - so, why steal it?Anyway, the above was not meant as an aside - it's relevant to thereview - because it underlies the basic facets of this movie - wherethe Brits are made to look both incompetent and dimwitted by our USbrethren (that implies a brotherhood that at least one of us no longerfeels.).
