I'm not gonna comment much on the quality of this movie, everything hasbeen pretty much been said. It's lazy, unfunny etc.. What I want tocomment on is product placement. This movie was clearly paid by Alcoholtrade to not only focus on their product, but to also take a jab on themarijuana industry. This was evident when they put marijuana in thesame category with Heroin and Cocaine, while marijuana has becomelegalized, just like alcohol. They go so far as to have everyone whosmokes marijuana get infected only to have Hale Berry in close up say"thats why you should drink whiskey".. Cheap
