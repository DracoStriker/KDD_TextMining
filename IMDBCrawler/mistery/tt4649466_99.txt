The first Kingsman was a very original, quirky movie with a strong castand plot.The second starts with a very strong action scene, but it all goesdownhill from there. Julianne Moore and her henchman seem like weakrehashes of the movie's first villains. Taron Edgerton also cannotcarry a movie by himself, I just don't like him as an actor. The wholeStatesman thing was absolutely hokey and silly at times. Whereas theEnglish Secret Service look cool and respectable, the Americans looklike complete dorks. Why are the Statesmen headquartered in Kentuckyand not DC again? The Kingsmen are headquartered in London! Everythingabout it just didn't work for me.The finale was incredibly anti-climactic, underwhelming andpredictable. If there is another, I hope they get things back on track.To be honest, I'm good with the first and never hope to see anotherKingsman again.
