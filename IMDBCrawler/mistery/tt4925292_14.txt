Saoirse Ronan plays Lady Bird. We all knew a Lady Bird. In high school,in college, at work. Male or female. The misfit toy, the square peg,the rebel without a cause. Someone nobody thought was anything, but inreality, extraordinary. Extraordinary by just being who they are andunafraid of what others will think of them in doing so.Lady Bird is a triumphant film of 2017. Only one emotion swept throughme as I sat and watched. Pure joy. Lady Bird is an entirely memorablecharacter. In some ways, a feminist answer to Max Fischer fromRushmore. The way she navigates through her humble catholic schoolupbringing is hilarious. She uniquely adapts to the pitfalls of thecoming-of-age. The discovery of love, sex, popularity, rejection andthe anticipation of college. At the same time, Lady Bird wishes she wassomething more and much to the chagrin of her own mother, who wishesshe could just be normal. Laurie Metcalf's performance as Mrs.McPherson is heartbreaking and real. A mother in the cross- hairs ofunconditional love and utter disappointment in her daughter. LadyBird's dynamic with her mother thought the film is chilly anddismissive, but deep inside, she fully appreciates all that she hasgiven to her, and vice-versa.As a former socially anxious, awkward teenager, I can certainly relateto wishing I were somewhere else, wishing I was someone I wasn't andperhaps unappreciative of what I already had. Lady Bird doesn't justsimply rehash the coming-of-age story for us all to harken back to wayback when, but to reflect in an adult manner, what it means to have afamily that cares about you through it all. For that, Lady Bird isworth every second of your time. You'd be unfortunate to miss it.
