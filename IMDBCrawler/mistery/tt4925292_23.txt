This is an entertaining, well-made film with comic elements. As amother-daughter story, I thought it failed. The mother depicted is anabusive narcissist, and the movie seems to soft-pedal this.Lady Bird's mother is verbally abusive with occasionally frighteningresults. Yet ultimately the film does not really explore the effects ofthis on Lady Bird (Christine). The abuse is ultimately depicted as justtypical human flaws and a conflictual mother-daughter relationship. Atthe end, I felt like I wasn't sure what would become of the maincharacter and I don't think the filmmaker knew either.The film does have many memorable comic scenes of Lady Bird's highschool life at a Catholic school. The film also addresses ageism andadoption, which is rare for a Hollywood film. It's worth seeing, but ifyou think this is an accurate depiction of normal mother-daughterconflict you are wrong. The mother is highly pathological and thedepiction is more like an accurate portrayal of a pretentiousnarcissist.
