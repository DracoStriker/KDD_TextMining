I always appreciate a film about the personal upheavals of reachingyoung adulthood. To be honest, I found this film mildly annoying attimes. Maybe because it's a film that just doesn't hold back on the rawemotion of growing up. The characters are very real and therefore thetaste it leaves is not always palatable. The story of a 17-year-oldgirl growing up in Sacramento and her personal travails with herparents, with school, with her friendships, with boys and with herhopes and dreams didn't exactly grab me initially.The good news is that it's so superbly acted that I was able to absorbit and enjoy the wonderful moments of truth in terms of one'srelationships with those you've grown up around. In that regard, thisfilm cuts very close to the bone. I just wish the narrative had beenmore brisk and not as deliberate. For a film with this short a runningtime, it feels long. Toward the end, it drags a bit. Perhaps GretaGerwig in her directorial debut is still figuring how to end a film onthe perfect note.But again, the performances here are tour de force, especially SaoirseRonan who is exceptional as the teenage girl who spends most of thefilm coming to grips with a sense of self and an independent identity,something hard-earned in a difficult family. By the end of the film,we've come to know her completely. Recommended to those looking for agood character study.
