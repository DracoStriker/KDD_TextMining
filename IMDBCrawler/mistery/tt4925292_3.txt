I remembered Greta Gerwig from "Frances Ha" which I didn't really carefor so I was more than surprised to discover that not only can shedirect (as evidenced by her efforts here with Lady Bird) but is atalented screenwriter as well (yes, she also wrote the screenplay!).Her story is set in (of all places), Sacramento, and stars theconsistently strong Irish-American actor Saoirse Ronan as Christine"Lady Bird" McPherson, an off-beat adolescent in her senior year at alocal parochial school, hoping to get accepted by a good school on theeast coast (as opposed to a state university which her parents canafford).Christine calls herself "Lady Bird" in order to stand out from herpeers, and her mother Marion (played by Laurie Metcalf in a potentialOscar-winning performance) can't get used to the new appellation. Theconflict between the two is the highlight of the film, as Christine'smother is hard on her daughter at almost every turn, wanting the bestfor her but insisting on good behavior. Christine, on the other hand,resents her mother's interference in her life and consequentlystruggles with her self-image. Gerwig's portrait of the waywardadolescent is spot-on, as Christine exhibits that perfect mixture ofarrogance and wisdom, typical of gifted but confused teenagers.Gerwig is intent on eschewing the usual clichés of coming-of-agenarratives. What impressed me the most was her sympathetic treatment ofthe parochial school priests and nuns, entrusted with educating kidswho are not exactly what you would call devoted Catholics. You wouldn'texpect a priest (Father Leviatch) to be conducting auditions for aSondheim musical (in this case, "Merrily we Roll Along") but that'sexactly what he does and later bemoans the unenthusiastic audiencereaction, exclaiming that they "just didn't "get it"?he's also the samepriest who conducts a group therapy session exhorting the students tobe the "first one to cry" (and of course, it's Father Leviatch who isthe first to emote!).There's also another hilarious scene with the football coach (anotherpriest!--Father Walther) who subs for Father Leviatch (who eventuallyresigns due to depression). The coach directs Shakespeare's "TheTempest" as if it's a football game and the beleaguered drama studentsall must cope with the coach's crazy approach.When Christine is suspended after falling afoul of a teacher whopromotes a pro-life stance (relating that her mother was considering anabortion?and this particular teacher wouldn't have been born had hermother gone ahead with her initial decision), the Mother Superior,Sister Sarah Joan, confides to Christine that that the anti-abortionteacher is really a blow-hard and she actually found Christine'scomments (that led to her suspension) to be amusing. Hence, Christinegets off lightly with Gerwig emphasizing the humanity of the nun incharge.There are multiple twists and turns in the plot that keep the storyfresh throughout. When Christine discovers her first love, Danny, isgay, she stops speaking to him out of anger. But later she forgives andhugs him, after he reveals that he'll probably be rejected by hisfamily if he comes out of the closet. Similarly, the theme offorgiveness is also played out in Christine's relationship to her bestfriend, Julie, with whom she has a falling out over her newrelationship with Jenna, a "bad girl" to Julie the "good." After Christine falls for a second boy, Kyle, she again enduresdisappointment when she discovers that he's already slept with sixother girls and is no "virgin" as he had told Christine earlier. Thisleads the emotionally devastated Christine to reconcile with Julie, andin another delightful twist, they end up dancing together at the SeniorProm!Last but not least, Christine's father, Larry (a low-key but highlyeffective Tracy Letts), despite having lost his job, provides emotionalsupport for Christine along with helping her fill out financial aidapplications. Much to her mother's chagrin, Christine is accepted by acollege in NYC and her mother isn't talking to her as she jets off toher new life at the university.An overdose of alcohol (which lands her briefly in the hospital)perhaps is the trigger that helps her to grow up and realize that hermother loved her all along, and she is now ready to start her freshmenyearbin New York as a full-fledged adult!With the usual ubiquitous glut on the market of coming of age stories,Greta Gerwig manages to infuse her tale with a rich tapestry ofintuitive observations of life, making her freshman effort anextraordinary winning one, deserving of all the accolades alreadyheaped upon it.
