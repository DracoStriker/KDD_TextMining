Greta Gerwig's directorial debut is a very funny and entertaining filmabout a rebellious young woman who is a senior at a Catholic highschool in Sacramento. She wants to attend college on the East Coast,preferably in New York City. I have always been a fan of Gerwig and herwork, and I can say that her filmmaking skills are incredibly stronghere as far as directorial debuts go. The screenplay is full of wit andemotion. While the film is very light in tone, the characterizationspresent through the narrative as well as the film's juxtaposition ofits main events pertaining to Lady Bird's (the nickname of theprotagonist) final year in high school give the script considerableweight and power.Saorise Ronan gives a hearty and very authentic performance in the leadrole, and the supporting cast is generally very strong. The film's tonefeels playful but also enjoyably sassy and thoughtful. As a result, thefilm feels far more potent than just about anything in theteenage/coming-of-age genre. While the film's pacing in its final scenefeels slightly awkward given its contrast of pace with the rest of thenarrative, the film feels fully satisfying in its entirety despiterunning a lean 93 minutes. Additionally, some of the plot devices thathelp form the narrative and plot line of the film feel ratherpredictable. However, that ends up being only a minor complaint becausethe humor, heart and bite of the writing helps drown out any sense ofclichés that a viewer might feel. Overall, I thought this was a greatand very funny coming-of-age comedy that I had a lot of fun watching. Ilook forward to seeing what Greta Gerwig does next with her undeniabletalent. Definitely recommended. 8.5/10
