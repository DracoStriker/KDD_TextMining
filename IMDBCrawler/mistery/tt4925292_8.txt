"Lady Bird". No, this film is not about Lady Bird Johnson! However, ifyou're a fan of films like "The Big Stick," "Juno," "Little MissSunshine," and "The Way Way Back," then writer/actor/producer GreatGerwig's solo run at directing/writing is going to be right up youralley. Saoirse Rona ("Brooklyn") stars as the reluctant yet bloomingteenage who's at ends with her overly critical mom (the always amazingLaurie Metcalf - HBO's "Getting On"), while he dad (equally reliableTracey Letts "August - Osage County" writer) sits quietly by. Since thestory is a coming-of-age event, the excellent Lucas Hedges'("Manchester by the Sea") and Timothy Chalamet ("Interstellar") eachhave a lesson to teach "Lady Bird". And, since every young female needsa BFF, Beanie Feldstein ("Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising") fits the billjust perfectly. Gerwig presents a believable, honest, enjoyable and attimes heartbreaking story that will surly touch viewers. There are nogun battles, CGI effects, loud explosions, superheroes or animatedcartoon figures here to dazzle. Instead, for a pleasant 1 1/2 hours,the audience is given an opportunity to step into the McPherson familylife, and the life of fellow Sacramento California youth, to experienceall the various trials and tribulations youth and families must endureduring this thing call life. With an indie feel, "Lady Bird" could bothjoin the ranks of the film mentioned above and lead the category intoAwards Season.
