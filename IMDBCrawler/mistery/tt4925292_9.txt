One of the best coming-of-age, mother-daughter films since JUNO andTERMS OF ENDEARMENT. LADY BIRD depicts what it really means to be onthe cusp of adulthood; taking the big leap to move away from home, etc.It has many 'fresh' aspects to it. The main protagonist, Christine aka''LADY BIRD'', she's not perfect! She has acne, she makes mistakes,etc, and played so wonderfully by Saoirse Ronan. Gerwig has reallyestablished herself as a strong director and screenwriter. Herscreenplay is probably one of the strongest original screenplays. Ilook forward to watching again. Hopefully it will be a strong awardscontender!
