Very disappointing because of:*The worst voice quality of the recently watched films - terrible *Badstart ever, asphalt road, clear walls etc!!! *Too sterile pictures,sights - every body who starts a research will see on the old 1940sphotos of Dunkirk that roads , buildings and coasts were full of mess,debris etc. *The casts have no faces, names like zombies - only a diedboy's name - George- remained in my mind. There is no really maincharacter(s) *Very poor views of the dogfights *Poor picture quality-grain noisy and sometimes the objects is out of focus- and cameramovements compared example to the War for the Planet of the Apes - overall the best quality every levels, sound, voice, picture quality,camera movements actors performances etc.- and compared to other IMAXmovies *I gave only 1 point because of these reasons, the huge budgetand the very professional A list directors, crews and actors. Thebottom of the B category for ~150 mil.Finally I was a big Nolan fan but now I am very disappointed and a bitup set in turn I'm and my family big fan of the cinemas especiallyODEON ISENSE with Dolby Atmos. Usually I didn't do reviews I'm sick ofthis terrible movies.
