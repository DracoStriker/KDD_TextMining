I do not understand why this movie gets such good reviews when it doesnot reflect how it really was. Where are the 400,000 people? Where areall the planes, the boats? The big ships that are hit by torpedoes orbombs roll over to the left side right away and sink, quite strange.Then you have a spitfire that runs out of fuel at a fairly lowaltitude, yet it's flying around forever and shooting other aircraftdown before it lowers the undercarriage and lands well on the beach.They have also added a noisy background sound that becomes quiteannoying in the long run. A disappointing movie that's not worthwatching at the cinema.
