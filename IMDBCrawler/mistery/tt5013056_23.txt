From a different viewpoint as this author walked down 101 floors of theSouth Tower on September 11. Worked for Aon and came away with not PTSDor dust-health problems (I was far uptown when the towers came down).So as I sat watching Dunkirk, the cummulative effect was to virtuallyrelive aspects of THAT day for me. It's impossible to describe horror,fear and what it was like to BE there, or BE at Dunkirk. Many films andbooks (fondly MRS. MINIVER was the first). Or the heroic dogfights ofBATTLE OF Britain. This one - far different. I came out of the theaterfeeling that I had just been through not only Dunkirk but 9-11 as well.It is THAT effective. The lack of dialogue for a good part of the filmdraws the viewer INTO the story as a real participant. YOU'RE THERE.Spielberg did it a few times such as the 20 minute Omaha Beach segmentof SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but even that film became just a more intenseversion of the standard war film.Be prepared to have your life changed by this one. It's that damn good.
