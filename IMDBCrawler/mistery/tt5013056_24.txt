I honestly believe that if I had started a shouting "boo" at the end ofthis movie, I'd have had a large chorus in support. What the heck?Three different time lines of differing duration, where we are forciblyjumped back and forth without warning? It's daytime! No, wait, it'snight. Oops! It's day again...hang on to the popcorn Martha, it's nightagain. Hey, wait a second... didn't that boat just sink?Whatever genius Nolan has inserted into this film is lost in themishmash. I left not caring for a single character. I was wonderingjust how long a spitfire out of gas can glide? Apparently it's farlonger on screen than might be the case otherwise.The good? A very promising opening. The bad... everything else,including the music.
