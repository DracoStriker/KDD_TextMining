I am fully disappointed with that movie. Brazilian specialized press issaying that is the best movie of the year. Elio Gaspari in his papers'column said today the movie is excellent. I fully disagree. First ofall it is a boring movie. I had two or three times the wish of leavingthe theater. As a matter of fact, some guys did so. Second, is a quiteillogical movie, regarding space and time. They mixed together timeshifted events, and I just realized that reading the critics. Third isa type of horror movie in which the intention is to scare you. Why thesound is so loud? I had the impression Count Dracula would show himselfup to bite some soldiers' neck. After spending and loosing 5USD withthe ticket and regretting not to leave the theater before movies end, Irealized that was the worst movie on WWII ever shot. I dare to say thatis the worst movie ever shot about any war, not just WWII.
