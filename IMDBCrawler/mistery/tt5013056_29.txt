Best war movie ever made, not by far. The only good thing about thismovie is a few great cinematic camera shots and that is it. Lets seewhere to start (spoliers coming):1. Apparently German Army participated in the battle of Dunkirk; with 2Henschel Hs 129 bombers, 3 dive bombers Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka's) and 3Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, which were all apparently shot down by 3RAF Spitfires. As that is the only German troops you will see the wholemovie! Myabe they were not there? Batman got them on time? 2. You havetwo genius actors Sir Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy, but you write ascenario where both of them have 10 lines in the whole movie? I don'tbelieve that Tom had more then 2 lines that lasted for 1 min. Nowpeople will say, you don"t understand the story it self is a maincharacter! That is all fine, but then I can watch Denkirk documentary,it is more intense then this! 3. Harry Styles should stick to music, ashis acting is very One Direction. I mean everything is so predictable,you just look at him and know its a movie? There is no suspense in hisacting, there is no character build up what so ever, etc.I could go on and on, many more things are bad about this movie, but Iwould be in danger to write more words than what are in screenplay ofDunkirk!Wait to come on Netflix, DVD or something, don't waist your money incinema. PS I gave it a 3, it will probably end up around 7 when all hype dies,but I expected a historical intense masterpiece, and got nothing!!!
