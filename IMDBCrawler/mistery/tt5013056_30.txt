Story-line -> Imagine you went to sleep in your calm and quietapartment and suddenly woke up due to some noise and find yourself in aremote island, don't have a clue where you are ...this is how you feelwatching this movie. People who do not have any idea about Dunkirk orits background story will be lost as Nolan didn't made any effort toexplain/hint anything clearly. With Nolan Movies it's always fill upthe blank storytelling's so audience(read Nolanites) can go to movieagain and again and fill it up with pseudo intellectualinterpretations, this is the way he earns money.There is nothing toroot for ,lot of emotionless blank-faced characters in this movie butno one to care for. Tom Brady(sad to see such a good actor go waste)flies around covering his face(may be he forgot this is Dunkirk notDark Knight Rises), just so Nolan can show us aerial glimpse of his egoridden pseudo intellectual crap.Pure Noise -> Out of the 100's of movies i have seen in theater's thisone had the loudest and ear-drum numbing sounds without actually anyneed for it. Nolan always uses noise to hype-up many of his overratedscenes, whether it's the batman chase scene or joker burning pile ofcash or chasing vans but this was his worst, literally every scene waspure noise, if you are going to watch this movie in theaters pleasetake some cotton balls to protect your ear drums (not joking).Was rooting for enemies to bomb the place and end my misery, didn'thappen so walked out of the movie after 80 minutes.
