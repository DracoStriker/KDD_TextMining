This was a good try to be sure, but in truth I felt underwhelmed when Ileft the studio. The film is technically near perfect but it fails toshow the true scale of the evacuation or the civilian and militaryfleet that pulled it off. Also it totally failed to show the heroicdefense by the French who held the Germans back for those vital fewdays and allowed the British to escape.Early on Kenneth Branagh's character states that there are over 400.000men on this beach yet we fail to see any more than 200 or so in anyshot, the rest of the time the beach feels near deserted. Now Iunderstand that hiring 400.000 extras for a film would be financiallyand logistically impossible yet without this kind of scale or even someclever CGI work this film feels like a few dozen guys running about ona beach being rescued by a handful of boats. Anyway, it was still agood try and the aerial dogfights with the Spitfires was magical, thatalone made it almost worth watching, almost.
