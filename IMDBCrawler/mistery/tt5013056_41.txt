With high expectations (it is a Christopher Nolan movie after all) weentered the cinema. With even higher disappointment, we left it.Dunkirk was two hours of the same over and over and over again buildingscene after scene with tense music only to leave the scene againwithout any climax. It was a confusing mix of scenes that failed toshow the overall picture. If you like war movies, there are far bettermovies out there.The movie started out right and you're thrown right in the middle ofthe action and sitting on the edge of your seat you expect the movie todive right into a great story, but then it stops, the climax halted,the story does not really develop and you're left with a feeling ofmissing something. The entire size of the evacuation (which should havebeen enormous) is completely missing. The dread of leaving in timebecause the Germans are breathing down their necks is absent and thescenes often jump to different time frames of the evacuation process.In fact the only Germans you see in person in the entire movie appearin the very end.The acting was OK and so were the different characters put in place:you have your heroes, each in their different way and you have yourcowards, also each in their own different way. The cinematography waspretty well setup.Despite a huge potential in possibilities, Dunkirk did not convince meand I feel left stranded on the very beach they tried to escape from.
