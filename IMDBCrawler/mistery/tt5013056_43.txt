Normally I love this kind of wartime historic movie but it wasabsolutely terrible, just a total Turkey. Dunkirk is a infamous pieceof British history, it was a disaster like the film !The filming itself is reasonably good, but the biggest thing that letsit down is the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer should be fired ! It is constantrelentless noisy drone through literally every single scene, that addsnothing and which totally ruins it. When it switches from one scene toanother the same drone continues ! It is doesn't feel in any way 1940s,and neither does it feel British or French apart from the very lastscene, but by then I was glad to get out. At the very least the entiresoundtrack should be changed.There is almost no speaking or chit chat at all by any of thecharacters so you know nothing about them not even their names. Againnot natural. Even in the very first scene when he arrives on the beachand takes a drink from another soldier. They don't even speak whichisn't natural and just not what British people do. Strange stuff alsohappens in that the young lad seems ill and then dies on the boat butthere is no clue why ? Has he been shot ? You don't see anyone German at all other than another bomber or anotherStuka. The film could have been so good in that the scenes themselveslook okay(ish) but it just doesn't work as a film. When all the little ships arrive together this was quite nice, and oneof the main legends of Dunkirk but they don't make enough of this. Inconclusion save your money and watch it on TV instead but only if youare a real WW2 buff.If you want to see a real genuine movie about how it was flyingSpitfires etc then watch the Battle of Britain film, hint they don'tfly until they run out of fuel, It is literally about 5 minutes for aSpitfire to fly back across the English channel to refuel.
