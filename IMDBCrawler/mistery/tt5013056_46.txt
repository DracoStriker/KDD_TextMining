I went to the cinema with good expectations. A great war movie.. Well..It's wasn't great, and it wasn't a war movie..400.000 men it said on the poster, if I would count there were at mosta 1000.Surrounded by Germans it said, maybe it was at the time I went to thetoilet but no Germans seen here..After 1 hour I really wanted to get out of the cinema, but I was notalone so eventually I stayed for the whole (too long) 1:45..Don't go and pay money for this, if you really want to see it despitethe awfulness this movie is, watch it on Netflix and buy a lot of beerto drink the story through..
