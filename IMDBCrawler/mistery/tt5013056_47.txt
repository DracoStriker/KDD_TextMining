I am still trying to pick up the pieces of my brain after watching thisso called 'epic movie ever' with so many dumb accolades! I am still ata loss to figure out what the heck Nolan was trying to tell us? Is itthe 'heroic work' of allied troops; which actually to me, were lamelywaiting for their death? Or was it about just one single heroic job ofa RAF pilot or two? Or just about a story of some crap Nazi pilots, allof whom just got shot by one or two RAF planes who were running evenwithout a drop of fuel? Some pilots can kill even when they are glidingso I guess miracles happen, doesn't it?? And the pain of racing yourbrain in between millions of scenes just nearly assassinate you! Whydid Nolan think he was creating climax by swapping a soup of 3 mainbackground scenes over and over, so quickly, till the end where thatjuggling-in-between scene job exhausts you to near death? It totallykills the smooth flow of any story telling if there was any! I don'thave anything to comment about acting because there was no acting ofany significance. All the actors were like monuments. And what was thatguy Fionn was doing as Tommy, I don't have heck of an idea! There wasnothing to comment about music either which I did fairly OK with mystrong ear plugs. Editing was the mantra for Nolan it seems andprobably is much better than the director's job I must say.In short, just waste few dollars and hours and get a boring dull storywith an endless cacophony!
