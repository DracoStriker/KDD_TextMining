The evacuation of Dunkirk was one of the most important moments inhistory, and a pivotal part of WWII. This movie had the opportunity toexpress the greatness and the gravity of this event, and it failed. The flyover shots of a few dozen soldiers on the beaches, when thereshould be ten of thousands, failed to express the enormity of thesituation. Similarly the dozen or so civilian boats, when there shouldhave been thousands, underwhelmed their contributions. The attempt tohumanize the story by showing a few individual vignettes, in one case asingle incident shown from multiple perspectives, also failed. No one character was engaging enough to impress the tension ormagnitude of the situation. In essence this movie made a momentous andterrifying event a little boring. In doing so, it does a disservice tothose that have experienced combat.
