This movie is a snapshot glance at possible events during theevacuation of the allied troops at Dunkirk after the military disasterfollowing the German invasion of France in 1940. I was pretty much bored throughout the first half of the movie and atvarious times thereafter. Although the historical significance of theevents are captured to a limited degree, several of the fictionalelements shown were actions of abject stupidity and left me stunned. #1: No hospital ships were sunk by German aircraft at Dunkirk. #2: Theevents in the beached trawler were so absurd I doubt any person couldbe so ignorant. Soldiers trying to plug 30-50 bullet holds in the hullwith their fingers and then thinking that killing and throwing out aFrench soldier would make up for tons of continuous flooding. #3: Theshooting down of the German bomber (an event that would have taken 30second in real time) took 10 minutes in film time. I decided theSpitfire must have been flying at about 1 mile an hour. #4: The killingof the teenager had no significance and was a totally pointless plotdevice. #5 The out of fuel spitfire then made several impossible aerialmaneuvers to shoot down a German plane flying 200 miles an hour fasterthan it was. The only truly heroic person in the movie was the civilian boat captainwho managed to dodge his boat around a German fighter attack, a totallyabsurd scenario. I have never, however, seen anything that indicatedGerman aircraft attacked any small civilian boats. All and all I can'texpress my disappointment with this movie. I don't think its terrible,but it is certainly not praise worthy.
