Too loud, too disjointed, too much Kenneth Branagh staring meaningfullyinto the distance. There seemed to be many scenes that would not bereasonable, starting with two soldiers encountering each other in anisolated location: they would not silently go about their businesswithout confirming each other's identity. I thought I saw a spitfirethat had run out of fuel first fly right-to-left, then left-to-right toland on a beach in front of the Germans, descending in daylight andlanding in darkness. There was so much confusion as to what was beingshown, and such loud "music" that it was difficult to follow the story.The critics seem to love this movie. I don't know why.
