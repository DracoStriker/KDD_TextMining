After many great reviews I decided I would go and watch this on the bigscreen for the atmosphere and in that at lease I have to say it wasgreat. But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down.This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics wouldsuggest. I am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but evenI know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn't live up the epicnature of the true story. The characters don't do the story justice, the timelines are blurredand the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes anda few uplifting moments but it just didn't feel tied together.My rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don't rate this a one ofthe great efforts of story telling. If you didn't know anything of theactual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epicnature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in1940.
