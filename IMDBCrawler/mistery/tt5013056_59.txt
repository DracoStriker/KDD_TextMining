As the daughter of a man who fought in WW2, together with all othermale relatives in our family, I was anxious to see this film whichshould have been both an emotional and educational experience. Sadlyfor us it was a disappointment and left us wondering exactly why thefilm is called "Dunkirk".There are good performances and some emotional scenes, particularly atthe beginning of the film. But the time line was so confusing and thebeach was so empty considering that there were well over 300,000 menawaiting evacuation. And where were the 800+ small boats which sailedback and forward over a period of 8 days and, together with the largerBritish destroyers and merchant ships, saved almost 340,000 soldiers.We saw endless air battles which were beautifully filmed but weren'texciting or effective.Finally the music - Hans Zimmer is a wonderful composer of film musicand his creation for this film was effective. But why so loud and somuch? It was almost impossible to hear some of the text and I'mastonished that a director of the caliber of Nolan thought that thiswould add to the tension. Sometimes silence says far more than theconstant background of very loud music.I presume that many of these things won't bother a younger audience butI believe that the story of Dunkirk deserved to be more accurate. Themost annoying thing was the fact that in the brief introduction to thefilm, where there is an explanation as to the situation of the trappedsoldiers, the enemy surrounding the soldiers is not named - they arejust 'the enemy'. What happened to naming them as the German Army orthe Nazi Army?
