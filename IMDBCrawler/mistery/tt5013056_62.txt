Would Dunkirk have received the same ratings and reviews if anotherdirector's name were attached to it? We both know the answer to that.The Dunkirk evacuation was described by Churchill as a miracle.Hundreds of thousands of men were evacuated from a seemingly hopelessposition by a fleet of over 800 boats. Christopher Nolan's latest moviefails to capture the magnitude of what really happened during that weekin 1940. Instead we see a few hundred, maybe a few thousand men beingrescued from a beach. It was a nice rescue story but that's all it was- there was nothing "miraculous" about it and I didn't really care forany of the characters.Decent movie, but I was forcing myself to like it because it'sChristopher Nolan. The truth is, if the same exact movie was made byanother director - maybe a new director - the ratings and reviews wouldbe saying something entirely different. This is nowhere near thegreatest war film of all time, in fact, it's not even the greatest warfilm of the last 12 months. That would go to Hacksaw Ridge.
