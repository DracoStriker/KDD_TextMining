Definitely cold and empty, no character development, and so why havemovie stars.Not in the same league as Saving Private Ryan, or Hacksaw Ridge, as itdidn't really feel like a movie. More like a fly on the wall, with alot of apparent continuity errors, from grey sky to suddenly blue, andthen back to blue again. The movie felt rushed, trying to set scale yet overlooking story, andcharacters.I am not sure of the target audience, but had I not spent the price ofa movie ticket, and been watching on TV, I would have turned it offafter 20 minutes.
