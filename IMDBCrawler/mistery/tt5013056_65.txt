Technically, the movie was strong. But that's about it.Watching the movie felt like as if everyone involved with the movieknew very well that since the topic is something that touches an entiregeneration of people around the world and the sheer scale andsignificance of the event the movie allegedly portrays, people will andshould just slurp it up. Who cares about the story and how it unfolds?Why work on it when we'll just keep showing the horrors of war usingnice VFX? People are BOUND to say it's good or they'll be calledinsensitive.Zero efforts were made in storytelling. It was not a movie and neitherwas it a documentary. No story to call it the former and not enoughfacts to call it the latter. It was just a cheap effort slapped uptogether to have a sure shot way of earning profits.And why shouldn't they? Look at the raving reviews calling it amasterpiece. They do it because it works.
