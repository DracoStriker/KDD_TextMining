What a sad disappointment! To be fair, it's an OK movie.. However itfails to deliver in regards to the strong story telling expected fromChristopher Nolan; also makes you wonder what happened to the greatmovie scores Hans Zimmer used to compose. Matt Seitz has a high opinionof the movie yet says: "If somebody were to ask me if I liked thisfilm, I would tell them no. I loathed parts of it and found other partsrepetitious or half-baked. But, maybe paradoxically, I admired itthroughout". I agree with him except for the last part. I didn't findmuch to admire about Dunkirk except for the camera work.
