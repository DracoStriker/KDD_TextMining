I like war movies but I certainly didn't like this one. I feel thetitle is wrong because it's not so much about Dunkirk as its about someblokes who where there at the time.Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, becausethe movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore evenshowing some events twice. I hate this - Repetitive: Much scenes areidentical or slightly different from another. Flight scenes was likeWHO cares. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much apart of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance toactually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes.This movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans andcritics. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interestingplot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough bythe impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don'twatch this movie!
