Disappointed - script and acting were poor - also considering that 800vessels and 16 RAF squadrons were involved in rescuing the troops, thedepiction of just a handful of boats and planes didn't portray theenormity of what happened - the constant switching between air, landand sea did not help at all. The portrayal of soldiers using devious &callous means to get a 'lift home' was not typical of the hundreds ofbrave men who waded into water for many hours to be ferried by smallboats to the larger destroyers. And why show one rescued soldieraccidentally killing a 16yr old boy - this was not what Dunkirk was allabout. The film was boring and left me annoyed that reality was ruinedby half baked fiction
