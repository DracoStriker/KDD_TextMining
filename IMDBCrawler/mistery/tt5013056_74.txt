While I found this movie visually great, it really has no story. It isa typical survival-story seen a thousand times before. No story + nointeresting characters = boring. And only the visual is not enough (forme). People who are rating this movie with 10 stars, are either beendumbed down by studios in the last 20 yrs ... or the reviews have beenbought by the studios for marketing reasons. It seems to me like Nolan wants to be a 'serious' film director now,and wants to get noticed by the academy. The superficial heroism ofmilitary and war by all these movies are really annoying and stupid.Seemed like Nolan got inspired by Mel Gibson, here. Good for Tom Hardy tough. I also would like to get a few millionDollars for watching left and right. Im disappointed on so many levels.
