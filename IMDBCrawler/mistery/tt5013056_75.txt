The evacuation of Dunkirk was a miracle. I had wondered what this filmwould have to say about it that hasn't been shown before. The beachscenes are portrayed as lines of soldiers standing quietly. There areno non-coms screaming orders or keeping order. Everyone is acting likethey are waiting for afternoon tea. Air battles: repetitive. The sameyellow-nosed Bf-109 gets shot down several times. (Yawn!) And thetiming of the air scenes is simply unbelievable. In an effort to createsuspense a Heinkel 111 takes nearly five minutes to get close enough tobe shot down by a Spit. This is despite closing speeds in excess of 500mph. Just not believable. Other efforts to create suspense are simplycontrivances. The crowning disappointment is the main kick: the miracleof Dunkirk was the response of hundreds upon hundreds of small boatowners, ship owners, ferry crews....ordinary Britons who risked theirlives to get anything that floats across the channel to rescue thetroops. This is given short shrift, not only in following only oneboat, but in so few boats actually being in the film. I don'tunderstand the hype this film has been given. Wait for it to come outon DVD, then don't bother to see it.
