2 hours of nothingness. No characters, no story line. Just some planesflying in the sky, a some ships, and boats with occasionally scattereddialogue and a few bombs here and there. I actually feel the soldierswho served in Dunkirk was done a disservice by this film. It was trulythat bad. I went because I saw it was a 9/10. This literally was theworst movie I ever saw. I could not wait to leave. I never writereviews but this film was deplorable in every sense. Did I expect it tobe great? No. Good? Sorta. Fair. Definitely. Worst movie I ever saw? Ididn't see that one coming. Not sure how you screw up a WW2 actionmovie about a cool battle but this Nolan cat apparently screwed thepooch on this one. Reviews must have been fake news / fake reviews lol.Omg. So terrible. Please folks save your money. As a matter of factjust give me half your money for the ticket and I'd be helping you out!Terrible, terrible, terrible.
