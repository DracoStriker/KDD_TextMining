I don't write reviews very often but feel compelled to do so on thisoccasion. I was really looking forward to seeing this film after all the ravereviews. But to say I am disappointed is an understatement. This has to be one of the most over-hyped films of recent times, withlittle storyline, depth and narrow focus of such a significant event inWW2. In addition, the soundtrack in the film has this constant VERY LOUDscreeching music and effects that frankly just got on my nerves,totally spoiling the little enjoyment I would otherwise have got. Save your money and avoid.
