This is absolutely the most boring movie I have sat through. Littledialogue, characters you couldn't care less for, most of the dialogueis mumbling, the score is annoying, the time-line is confusing to saythe least. There were 350,000 men on that beach, in the movie there area couple hundred at most. Full of cliché lines that make you cringe. Noenemy, no stakes, no obstacles for the protagonist whoever it was.
