I am sure that the critics that write the reviews are paid shillsbecause anyone who considers that movie to be a masterpiece has eithernever seen a war movie or is just taking money to lie to the public.Dunkirk was more spectacular than 7 or so boats, 3 planes and less than300 men in a line on a beach. And whose idea was it to pay Tom Hardy a ridiculous sum of the budgetto once again hide his face and never actually do what he is paid to dowhich last I checked was acting? It's obvious he was used in this movieto give it some credibility just like they did with the Mad Max debaclewhere he spent 3 quarters of the movie with a face covering onpreventing him from speaking. The noise was awful and apparently some of that noise was considered tobe music! Dull bass throbbing in every scene.Story? Lets not even go there. I can sum up the Story in one paragraphalthough you cannot really consider it a spoiler because there'snothing in this to spoil. "Trapped on a beach awaiting rescue but the ships keep gettingdestroyed by dive bombers with only 3 planes to protect those ships.Ends with Hardy finally revealing his face when he is captured afterlanding his plane which has run out of fuel."That's it. Everything else in between is just noise. To the people who consider themselves to be critics I say this: If youwant the movie industry to become like the gaming industry where themain goal is most profit in shortest time regardless of the contentthen keep spouting the BS otherwise you need to start telling the truthfor once. Two hours of noise and it cost them $100 million to make? It's obviouswhere that money went because these so called movie creators couldn'teven be bothered to use CGI to expand the number of men, ships andplanes to really set the scene. There was nothing in this movie and Tom Hardy was thick or corruptenough to be used as the marketing tool. Don't waste your money.
