I expected much from this movie, but got nothing. Besides nice effectsand good music film is below average. First, it is inaccurate, becauseHitler let British troops get away, it was not their effort, but justthe mercy of the Nazis. Second, story is very weak, in few words youhave British&French forces pinned down by the shore and few boatsrescuing them. Caracthers are undeveloped, for example Tom Hardy speaksmaybe 10 lines and he is wearing mask all the time. Harry Styles isactually good. There are few acts of so called 'bravery' and after thatfilm ends.By far, worst movie from Nolan to date. Big mess, weak story, ignoringhistorical facts. 4/10 and I am generous.
