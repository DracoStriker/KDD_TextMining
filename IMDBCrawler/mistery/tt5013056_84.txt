This movie is beyond bad:1. Annoying music: permanent background music that tries to conveydramatic moments for all the scenes, even undramatic scenes. I wasannoyed 15 minutes into the film. 2 Hours later, was wondering why Ididn't walk out of the film earlier. I counted at least 10 peoplewalking out and not coming back. 2. Bad editing. The story unfolds from three different perspectives,which makes the scenes repetitive and adding nothing.3. Boring. Nothing really happens.4. Unrealistic. Without giving any spoiler, the movie does notrepresent at all the sheer magnitude of what happened in Dunkirk.Please don't waste your time watching this, not even on Netflix or TV.
