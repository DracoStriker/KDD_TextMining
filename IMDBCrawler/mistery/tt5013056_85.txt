Average Movie. Nolan has made a bore with interstellar and now thisone. There is no story what so ever. Just soldiers on an island andsoldiers in a plane. No plot or anything. Just two hours of soldiers ona beach. Since this movie is based on true events, how did the movienot have a plot? Instead of wasting your money on this go to googleimages and type in soldiers on a beach or soldiers in a plane. There Isaved you 15 bucks. Loud and annoying music that wasn't needed. HansZimmer will try to use his music to have you thinking this movie willget intense but it never does.Another thing to note is most of the reviews on here for this movie arefake. I am constantly on this website and within the first 24 hours ofthe release of this movie there was already 100s of reviews posted. Noother movie will have that many reviews that fast. Chistopher Nolanmust of put some of the movie's budget into hiring people to writereviews. Planet of the apes came out a week before this and that onlyhas 50,000 votes. This movie already has 115,000. Don't believe me?then check for yourself. Either half the audience had permission towatch the movie before anyone else or Nolan hired 100s of people forfake votes. Nolan is falling fast after his Batman Trilogy and he is anoverrated director.1/10.
