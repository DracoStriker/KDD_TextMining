After enduring this film I was blown away to discover the criticalacclaim for this movie! Not to mention the IMDb user reviews! Thismovie took me to a whole new level of bland. To take one of the mostsignificant events of World War 2 and turn it into THE most dull andbland cinematic experience of my life. The film was woeful. I havenever been so detached from the characters in a film ever. I'm thinkingthe entire script would be lucky to fill more than a page. Not tomention the action. We have around 400,000 men needing evacuation. Butit looked like a couple of thousand. There was no scale. The action wasdamn stupid from start to finish. Did they hire an expert? Hell no. I'man ex soldier and that is not how any of that action sounds. Not tomention the cruddy no stakes PG 13 action. Did a main character justdie? No idea. The editing was so terrible. And who cares if a characterdies. There's no character development. So there's nothing to investin. What a mess.
