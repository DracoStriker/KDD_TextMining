Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positiverecommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplayforgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famousWWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the Frenchtroops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards arethe focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead ofeveryone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waitingtheir turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way torescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. Hekills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make theentire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one Germanbomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show threeRAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with allthe other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think theydid a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out whatthey are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/cit's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap.There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste ofmy money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time.
