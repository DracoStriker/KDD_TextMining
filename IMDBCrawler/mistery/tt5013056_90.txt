My greatest fear while watching Nolan's new movie if that just becausehe has delivered back to back world-wide hits and seen as the mostintelligent film-maker; critics and Nolan-fans are obliged to given10/10 ratings even if the movie is very average or even bad.Dunkirk finally turned my fear into reality.The movie is simply plain boring. You don't feel attached to anycharacter. I don't even care if they die. The Aerial shots featuringTom hardy all seem repetitive. It was not "immersive", "out of theworld" experience as many critics are saying.One critic wrote that there was pin-drop silence in theater. Yes, Iagree but not because people are tense but perhaps they are sleeping.And dear western media, I know world needs a anti-war message right nowbut that doesn't mean you start giving rave reviews to such a patheticmovie. ALL PEOPLE know wars are bad. EVEN TRUMP knows that. EVEN Hitlerknew that. We don't need a Nolan-movie to realize that.Half-hour into the movie and I was desperately waiting for it to getover. The only people who might like it are Britons because they haveheard Dunkirk stories growing up and might relate to it. But for restof the world, it is simple plain boring.Save your money and better watch Dark knight at home. Giving 1 star tobring some sanity back into the world. Although the movie might deserve6/10.
