Where do I start. I suppose it's that I feel compelled to write myfirst ever review. This is an abomination of a "film". From thehorrific score to the lack of character. From the ear splitting sounddesign to way he tried to "Nolan" the chronology. From the dull screenplay to the lack of any act structure it's a boring, aggravating mess.How is this getting such good reviews. I can only think that everyone,as I did, expected it to be another Nolan masterpiece!!!??? I've neverwanted to leave a cinema more and I was forced to sit through theungodly mess that was Transformers 5 last week.
