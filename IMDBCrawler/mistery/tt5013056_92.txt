One of the poorest quality movies I've seen in years hard to watchdisjointed. Poorly directed and badly composed hardly any linearcontinuityI had trouble finishing the whole film. Why people praise this isbeyond me when there have been so many better wartime dramasJust two examples say - compared to films like The Train with BurtLancaster or Saving Private Ryan this film would put audiences tosleep.
