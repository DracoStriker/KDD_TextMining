We had been waiting with anticipation to see this film. It had receivedmixed reviews but we kept open minds. I'm afraid the bad reviews arecorrect, the film is wasted opportunities. There is a far betterDunkirk made in 1958 starring John Mills and Richard Attenborough whichstands head and shoulders above this latest attempt. Or the BBC 2004 TVfilm starring Timothy Dalton and Benjamin Cumberbatch which explainshow the rescue was planned and implemented. Both had more realism anddrama and made you understand the incredible feat that Dunkirk was.The Dunkirk story is as much about the little ships but little was madeof these, they just started across the channel with much of the filmtaken up by one of them. There should have been nearly 2000 vessels ofall sizes involved in the rescue but all we saw were a handful at best.Similarly the RAF flew nearly 5000 missions over Dunkirk, not the threeor four planes shown. The weather in 1940 was also inclement overFrance for nearly a week which prevented the Luftwaffe from taking off.The film shows a beautiful blue sky.On the French beaches, there wasn't enough actors or CGI to make itlook like hundreds of thousands of men waiting for rescue, more like acouple of hundred at best. The French soldiers were indicated by half adozen actors and there was no Indian or other Colonial troopsrepresented, just queues of caucasians. Meanwhile Branagh standswoodenly, gurning at something for most of the film. Rylance might aswell have been the BFG as there was no difference in his acting.The worst part was Tom Hardy as a Spitfire pilot (probably moreaccurate to have given him a Hurricane which out numbered Spitfires andwere tasked with attacking bombers). The end of his role was justunbelievably silly. As was scenes of downed aircraft floating as ifthey were made of wood and polystyrene.I would like to see a Peter Jackson version of Dunkirk. Nolan's 2017attempt is a weak script and weak directing, both of which are hisresponsibility.
