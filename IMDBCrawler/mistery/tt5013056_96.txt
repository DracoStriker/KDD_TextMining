Please avoid watching this movie which have absolutely no respect forhistory, is full of anachronisms and is a grotesque apology ofanglo-saxon superiority. Learn an read about history. Nolan made ablockbuster probably to please American public. For the rest of theworld an especially in France it represents an insult to the thousandof french soldiers who died to allow escape of the English troops.Prefer "week end a zuydcoote" of Henri Verneuil far better.
