No, just no. Appalling. Now I've got to come up with 5 lines of text!The John Mills version is far more watchable. My father was at Dunkirk,he'd have been horrified at this film. What a waste of time and money,and it's not even historically on the nose. Santa Claus Conquers theMartians is a better film.
