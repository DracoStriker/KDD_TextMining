What a movie and what great acting. Frances McDormand has done amazingjob and deserves awards for playing Mildred Hayes. Although a veryserious subject, this movie is a comedy.The punch lines are to the point and absolutely hilarious. I went tothe Toronto International Film Festival to watch this movie and boy, doI consider myself lucky to have decided to watch it.The story, screenplay, direction are amazing. After The Grand BudapestHotel, this movie comes as a breath of fresh air.
