This is a movie about a woman who wants to get justice for the death ofher daughter, but the only problem is there is no suspect. Without asuspect there is no one she can get justice on. So, she takes out somemoney and buys three billboards near her home that targets the localsheriff for his failure to solve the case. Problem is, the localsheriff is mostly a nice guy who is dying of cancer and everyone intown begins to resent her for her actions. She has to deal with the aftermath of her decision to buy thebillboards. Characters take horrible actions to harm one another inretaliation or defense of her decision. But inside of each character,no matter who horrible their actions, there is a seemingly good personwho is simply wounded. This is the story of how they heal, or fail toheal, those wounds.The acting is great, and the cinematography is obviously very welldone. But the script begins to fall flat int he second half of the movie.There are too many things that fall into place out of coincidence tothe point it feels like the end of a high school musical. Also - thereis a character who plays a bully cop that becomes too much of a focuson the second half of the movie and this character simply is not thatinteresting. Anyhow, it's a very good movie but it's not a classic.
