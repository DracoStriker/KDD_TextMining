Three Billboard's is a movie that stays with you for a while. And I'mnot just talking about the "Walk Away Renee" earworm that came with myviewing.The story is so unpredictable, you're left with the realization thatthe main story is not really the main story.The characters are rich and complex in a demographic that could easilydevolve into clichés in the hands of a lesser skilled writer.The dialog is witty and funny while managing not to be too clever forits own good.To adequately describe the acting this movie would take way too long.Top notch performances all around.The pacing and precise balance of humor and drama reveal MartinMcDonagh's mastery of writing and directing. In my opinion, this is hisbest work yet.
