Some have referred to McDonagh's film as a black comedy. I wouldn'tquite call it that, though it does have its moments of grim humor. Itis more a film about grief, revenge and ultimately about doing right byothers. Harsh is the most apt way to describe the film's mentality.Nobody emerges from this story pure. You will come away battle-scarredbut also grateful at having absorbed a refreshingly blunt take on humannature. I wish I could say more, but this is a film where one should goin knowing as little as possible, as I did.Frances McDormand absolutely shines as the mother of a murdered teenagegirl. She has watched for months as the police department in her localtown has not come up with any arrests. She takes matters into her ownhands by putting up billboards demanding answers from the authorities.From there on, the town swells into a maelstrom of rancor, vendetta,recrimination and, if I gave away more it would spoil too much. SamRockwell is equally impressive as the dim-witted cop with supposedlylittle self-discipline and a short fuse. And Woody Harrelson is greatas the highly-regarded police chief who suddenly finds a roilingcontroversy on his hands.In terms of cinema embracing a dark, cynical point of view, this is thehardest film I've seen since "Nightcrawler". It takes its bleak view ofthe world and splashes it all over the screen from start to finish.There are scarce moments of rejuvenation and optimism. For the mostpart, the film revels in its dark sarcasm all the while keeping theaudience guessing about the its resolution and making no guarantees.The themes of grief and anger at the system's lack of results and thustaking matters into one's own hands are powerfully rendered here. Thesense of victimhood takes a back seat to up-from-the-bootstrapsempowerment. Love it or hate it, this film makes its points withconviction and sincerity, however rough around the edges. Stronglyrecommended.
