Writer-Director Martin McDonagh's THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE E.M. is oneof the true high wire acts of the year. It's a dark farce that treadsthe line from serious drama to satire to some low rent buffoonery thatmight not make the cut on a mediocre sit-com. For the most part, itworks, propelled by a profanely powerhouse performance by FrancesMcDormand.McDormand plays a grieving mother (Mildred) who's daughter was killedin a particularly gruesome manner. Fed up with police inaction, shebuys three billboards calling out the force. Add in choral music andstark locations and photography and the viewer thinks at the start thatthey may be in for some heavy going. And then Mildred opens her mouth -and, boy does she! Add in an idiot patrolman played by Sam Rockwell(Dixon), a goofy billboard salesman (Caleb Landry Jones), the local"midget" (Peter Dinklage) and other assorted colorful locals and thatfirst impression is upended. To his credit, McDonagh continues to defy one's expectations all theway to the delicious epilogue. Adding further support are a wry WoodyHarrelson as the Sheriff, and Lucas Hedges and John Hawkes asMcDormand's son and ex-husband, respectively. A sense of humor ismaintained no matter how dire the situation and that will be achallenge for some viewers. McDonagh doesn't always succeed. Some ofthe actions and situations go too far even for satire. McDonagh, anEnglishman, sometimes muffs the dialogue and characterizations. Heknows his targets, but, sometimes his aim is off just enough to markhim as an outsider.THREE BILLBOARDS is an angry comedy. But, one where that rage feelsright for the times.
