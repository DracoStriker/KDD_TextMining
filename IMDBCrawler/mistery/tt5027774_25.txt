Martin McDonagh's new film is an incendiary dark comedy that has sometonal similarities with his two previous films, "In Bruges" and "SevenPsychopaths." However, this film is also plenty unique, and while notperfect, it's a wickedly thoughtful while also somber film due to itsplot and general merits. The film tells the story of a woman in a smalltown in Missouri who puts up three billboards to depict her disapprovalof the local police chief's failure to investigate her daughter's rapeand murder. Gleefully profane and politically incorrect, the film'sno-holds-barred script generally works to create dramatic irony,tension and a sense of collective outrage. However, there are a fewmoments where its more hyperbolic senses fail to create the intendedeffect on viewers--or come across as if such writing devices are simplytrying too hard to do so. "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" should be commended for itsexceptional acting. Frances McDormand's performance in the lead role issimply outstanding. She manages to pull off a genuine sense of griefcombined with a twisted and engaging sense of humor that complementsher otherwise-serious characterization quite well. The supporting castis impressive as well, particularly Woody Harrelson's role as thepolice chief. Despite these unique strengths, the film does alsocontain some flaws. The climax and ending happen to go on too long forno particular reason, and there are portions of the film that do feelslightly atonal. However, this is a generally well-made and certainlywell-acted dark comedy. Recommended. 7.5/10
