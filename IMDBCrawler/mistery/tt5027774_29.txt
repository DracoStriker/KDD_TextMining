I had the pleasure of seeing the local premiere of Three Billboardoutside of Ebbing, Missouri tonight at the Paramount Theater as part ofAustin Film Festival. The film's style and humor is reminiscent of someof the better early Coen Brothers films (Blood Simple, Fargo, andRaising Arizona). The writer/director has basically stolen their style.Basically, a story that on paper is very dark and serious played withcharacters that are essentially humorous for dark comedic effect. Thepresence of Francis McDormand more-or- less completes the linkage. (Shemay well earn another Oscar nomination.) The film is deeply disturbingbuilt around a mother's quest for justice after her daughter's violentdeath, themes of death and dying, police incompetence and brutality,and hints of racism and spousal abuse. At the same time, it can behysterically funny and absurd. You want to laugh during one scene andcry during the next. The dis-functionality of just about everycharacter is somehow both disturbing and hilarious. I think like theCoen Brothers, writer/director Martin McDonagh want you to take theissues raised seriously, but perhaps not to take ourselves tooseriously. Overall, the acting and directing by a stellar cast isfirst-rate. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates this sort ofdark comedy.
