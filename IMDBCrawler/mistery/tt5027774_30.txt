Seen at the Viennale 2017: writing reviews about several movies in thelast year, I nearly have to pass on this one. Three Billboards is ofsuch high quality that it is nearly impossible to comment on it. Onlyhighly professional reviewers should dare to write something about suchhigh quality script, directing and cast. Why not ten stars, then? Westill have to see, whether this one will become a classic movie for theTop 200. Maybe, it will. For sure it earns such a high rating. ThreeBillboards touches soul and heart from 10 minutes after the beginningup to the end. Seldom I changed from laughing to sadness in such a highfrequency. But the movies greatest strength is: it gives hope. Hope inthe possibility that people can change from the worse to the better.People are changing in this movie. People can change in real life. Weget remembered that this is possible. For sure, I will never forget thehighly emotional moment, when Dixon risks his life by grabbing theburning crime file of Hayes and jumps through the fire wall. This moviedeserves every single Oscar it will (hopefully) get.
