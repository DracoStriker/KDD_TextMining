This movie first drew me in because it was an R Rated Black Comedy. AsI have been on the lookout for them since watching the Voices, Ihappily settled to watch this movie. And it was a good thing I did.Firstly, the director, Martin McDonagh, is one of the best I've known,and he did not let me down with this film. He managed to display whathe does best, creating a funny movie with a dark backstory. This was asheart moving as it was heart-wrenching. If you needed an example of anoxymoron, this would be the one. Funny and depressing, it tugs at yourheartstrings whilst keeping you on a journey of laughter.The cast, perfect. Being honest, I hadn't heard of France McDormandbefore. But after this film, I will never forget her. An amazing choiceof the dead daughter mother figure, she's stubborn and great. Will beseeing more of her work in time to come. Woody Harrelson and SamRockwell have great on-screen chemistry. Unlike McDormand, I am a hugean of Rockwell, loved his work in the Green Mile and Confessions of aDangerous Mind and if you aren't a fan of him for whatever reasonbefore this film, you will surely be one after. I'm surprised hemanaged to sneak in a few dance moves as well, he really stole theshow.So, if you are looking for something to brighten your day, I cannotrecommend this enough. As I have said, one of the best dark comedies ofour time. Please, watch it, you will not be let down.
