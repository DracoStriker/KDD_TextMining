The overwhelmingly positive reviews of this movie, as of today, aremore of a comedy than the movie itself. Nobody laughed once during themovie.A number of the plot twists are implausible, thus a comedy I imagine.The only reason to watch the entire movie would be an appreciation ofpropaganda.I think that this movie raises issues, that anyone will react to, in atotally meaningless way other than as a pretext for acting out whatbasically amounts to one political push after another.I can see where this movie might have appeal as a call to arms forthose looking for a cause.
