So far, this film has an IMDb rating of 8.3...and this isextraordinarily high. But the film has been in festivals and I am surethe rating will change some when the film is in general release. As forme, I think it's incredibly overrated.The story is about an angry mom, Mildred (Frances McDormand). Herdaughter was brutally murdered and raped...and the police haven't beenable to do anything with the case. So, in desperation and anger, sherents out three billboards and calls the local Police Chief (WoodyHarrelson) to task for this. Surprisingly, most of the town comes downagainst Mildred...who was just exercising her First Amendment rights.What happens from there...well, just see the film.There were many wonderful scenes and characters in this picture. But,there were also many main characters who were just god-awful andunlikable...including Mildred! In fact, later in the film when shethinks the police department has wronged her, she burns down thebuilding and accidentally flames one of the cops! So, no one who is amain character in the film is nice or likable...making this movie a bitof a hard-sell. Too much cussing (even by 2017 standards), very crudelanguage and overall nastiness prevent this one from being a must- seefilm.
