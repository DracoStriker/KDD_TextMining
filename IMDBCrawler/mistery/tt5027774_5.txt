It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of FrancesMcDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, theheroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This mightwell be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes isa divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of asmall, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped andkilled on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by thelack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent threedilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief ofincompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media,angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasinglyviolent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it isextremely funny. Above all because of Hayes' stubborn character and herability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. Themonologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her shehas gone too far, is priceless.Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another greatfeature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, graduallyshifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. Noneof the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising partsof their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a smalltown full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendlymidget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb shedoesn't know the difference between polo and polio.It is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'ThreeBillboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagineanyone not enjoying it.
