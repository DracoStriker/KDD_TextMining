We saw this last week at a special screening as part of the SAG FilmSociety series and it just blew everything else we had seen away! Ireally loved Breathe and Wild River, but this was not only riveting inits development and surprising in its plot twists, but just fascinatingto watch. The plot is crafted like an intricate puzzle that slowlyspins out as the characters interact and react in completelyunpredictable ways. The only thing I did NOT like about it is theending, because I felt it not only left the audience hanging in themiddle of the film, without resolving to a satisfying (for me)conclusion, but I also did not want it to END! That's how fascinatingthe characterizations are. McDormand and Rockwell are both standouts,but Harrelson definitely holds his own with them, as well as all of thesupporting cast. I don't usually write reviews, but this was somemorable that I had to post something. I will not give anything awaybecause it is better the less you know, but GO SEE IT!!!
