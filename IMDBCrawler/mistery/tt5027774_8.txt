I was almost afraid from watching the trailer that this would be one ofthose overwhelming movies because it involved dark and serious subjectmatter. I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually enjoyablebecause of the way it dealt with all the serious subjects. The scriptmixed just the right about of comedic relief (no, it isn't a comedythough there are some laugh out loud moments) with a compelling story.Each and every actor's performance was spot on for their characterwhich helped make it well worth seeing!
