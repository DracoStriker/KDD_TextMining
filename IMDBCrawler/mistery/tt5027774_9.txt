I won't even try and sum up all my feelings about this movie because nomatter what I'd write, it wouldn't do it justice.What l'll say is that it's brilliant, it's dark, it's hilarious - andnot in a slapstick-funny-kind of way but in an authentic and real funnykind of way - and it transitions so effortlessly between that hilarityand despair that I was captivated throughout the entire film.McDormand shines. Rockwell shines. Harrelson shines.Everyone shines.So far, for me, this has best screenplay, best actress in a leadingroll and maybe even best actor in a supporting roll written all overit.Every film lover is gonna talk about this gem in a couple ofweeks/months and I'm sure that every film lover is gonna absolutelylove this film.Thank you, Martin McDonagh!(9.1/10)
