***spoilers***First, let me say I loved Key and Peele's comedy sketches. They'rerefreshing and make light of racism in America. However, their movie isnot as good as the reviews say it is.There isn't one good Caucasion in this movie. Every single one isracist, egocentric, deluded, deceitful, immoral, and the list goes on.Every single African-American are down to earth, authentic, humorous,and so on. During the movie, I was watching evil vs good or black vswhite, which was clear as day. However, this is an anti-racism movie,isn't it? Then why are there so many stark contrasts? Abolishing racismisn't about creating two polar opposites, in fact, that is exactly whatracism is!If you want to create something with any sense of seriousness, thenmake something that shows reality: show that doesn't matter whatethnicity you are, you are capable of good and bad. What was the pointof this movie other than to show how horribly evil Caucasians are, ohan one Asian guy?Unfortunately, the comedy is lost within all this nuanced racistrhetoric. I'd rather describe this movie as a light torture-porn withsubliminal racism. If the movie was described as that, then I couldgive it a 10/10. If this was based on reality then I could accept it assuch but it's not(like portraying history). As Foucault and MorganFreeman tried to express: it's time to get rid of the barriers andrather celebrate the unity. If you don't quite understand my point, imagine this movie but reversethe races. Imagine the hero is running away from African-Americanhypnotizing slavers because white people are, I dunno, in fashion?Wouldn't be so funny anymore, would it? Even if the context of themovie was satirically humorous, the theme alone would brand everyoneinvolved a racist.If you like this movie, then good for you. However, see it as it reallyis - not an ant-racism movie. That, it certainly is not.
