I was pretty surprised that this film was turned out to be an antiracist movie! The story is simple enough that African American Chris goes to hisCaucasian girl friend Rose's parent home where every one victimizesAfrican Americans for their body transformation. The killers' motive is more religious cult than human trafficking. Thistopic is common in the latest Asian films which criticizing stealingparts of victims' bodies to sell for upper class millionaires. Technical feature is pretty common. For instance, the most crafted VFXis when hypnotized Chris draws into the liquefied floor in flush backsequence. I'm afraid of this filmmaker's courage to make a white versus blackfilm in present. However it is not that kind of propaganda, it justbelongs to black comedy. And it also embodies ideological racial phobiaof Caucasians after Obama regime appeared in US history. It deeply expressed the Caucasian's racial fear to more empoweredAfrican Americans and their historical revenge. This film physiologically well expressed Caucasian's minds in the USsociety in post Obama era. 10 out of 10!
