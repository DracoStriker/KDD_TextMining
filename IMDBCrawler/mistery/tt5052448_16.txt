Get Out is full of touches and surprises, strong acting, excellentdirection, and above it, it's a ride, a trip to a place Hollywooddoesn't normally go - it offers a unique experience - and in this ageof copycat, cookie cutter safe choice cinema, it stands out by a mile.Get Out is that rare beast - a film that leaves you satisfied yetpondering. We objected to its constant referral as a horror film - it'san effective thriller with mild horror elements - but it is not agore/slasher movie - this is more about getting under the skin, andinside the mind, of the viewer.The plot is simple: girlfriend takes boyfriend home. Home is not whathome seems to be. Fun ensues. The genius of this is the way it plays onboth white and black perceptions - we asked how the film would be ifyou reversed all the roles (pretty darn effective) etc;Get out and see it.
