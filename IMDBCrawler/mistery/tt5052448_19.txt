Seriously, when I watched this, it had an 8.1 rating. I wonder why. Imean, has this movie been watched only by people who have never seenclassics before? The acting is not natural, the story line isincomplete on all accounts and the entire movie is totally predictable.It's a combination of a couple of movies combined. But the story lineis as unoriginal as the title itself. And then suddenly the storyswitches from the friend point of view, where it seems to want tobecome a comedy, but it never really does. This is not a horror movie.Seriously, it is insulting to all horror movies ever made to be calleda movie in that genre. It is a thriller with some horror filled secondsat the most. It is never scary, it is never really keeping you on theedge of your chair. And on top of that, it's never believable.Especially the 'transplant' part. I mean, hello, it was about hypnosis,remember, and why all the white people want their brain cut in half orsomething and become a different race. How does it work keeping bothidentities alive? The other black men and women seem to just be in somekind of trance but who's inside? the husband of the older woman? anddid she pick him for being a hot young black man, or what? I notice itirritates me to write this actually. it's badly written and directed,racist and stereotypical and just misguiding of genres. Want to see agood movie? Want to save some precious time in your life? Then watchanything but this.
