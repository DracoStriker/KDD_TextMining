It's time for a young African American to meet with his whitegirlfriend's parents for a weekend in their secluded estate in thewoods, but before long, the friendly and polite ambiance will give wayto a nightmare. The first time that i watched the 'Get Out' trailer iknew that this film was going to suck and guess what? it does in somany levels. First of all this film is racist to the goddamn bone fromstart to finish this crazy family kidnaps black men and women and turnsthem into zombies so their crazy relatives can live on forever it'slike a crazy Frankenstein experiment they take off their brains or somesort of dumb idea and they basically become them but once you hit themwith a light they just snap out of it for a few seconds at least. Thewhole story makes no sense and the characters are dreadful to even sitthrew, Daniel Kaluuya is the only good thing about the movie but noteven he can save such a disappointment also i'm trying to process theword "comedy" that so many reviewers used in their reviews i mean'Scary Movie 5' had better jokes in it and Scary Movie 5 was a completedisaster too but at least i laughed at how stupid it was in here? It'sjust words like 'nigga' or 'my man' that are supposed to be funny. Themovie as i said it's racist against black people and they all treatedlike subjects or just empty boxes so they can fill in some crazymastermind. It's truly sad that some good actors participated in thisbut it's not their fault that the film was a disaster or that basicallythe 3rd act turned into an action/horror film. Jordan Peele'sDirectional Debut it's not only bad but it should be considered as oneof the worst horror films that has ever been made plus he isn't funnyat all, this film is easily the worst film of 2017 so far and it evenbeats 50 Shades Darker pretty easily in my book.
