The film is pretty basic and is fairly slow with loads of stereotypesthat really is not much horror but dark anti white comedy which is sadto even say is appropriate in any scenario.The acting of the main lead is good yet the rest are just plain sillyand the plot is pretty obvious once they get to the house and theending is obvious also. Not once was I shocked or feeling like it was aScream or horror film or even like Hostel which it really feels like attimes.I do not know how people can rate it 99% on rotten tomatoes. A 3 starfor the acting and the directing was good but the story was just silly.
