I think those who have glowingly awarded this film and praised thisfilm to the rafters need to re-watch it with a bit more of a criticallyaware eye.For sure there are positives...it isn't very long haha...no aspects areOK but I feel the negatives haven't been dealt with in most of thereviews.It is so plodingly slow at the start and riddled with obvious clichéand open questions, the twists are a brick in the face obvious andapart from the lead not particularly likable or believable.The cast act / overact at every opportunity with a couple of notableexceptions but for me it is the narrative / story itself that is theproblem.Get Out looks and comes across as a very 1970's thriller / horror,think The Stepford Wives (1975) for creepy neighbours and not all whowe think they are. For e it feels locked in this period of morepsychological horror but without much of a contemporary dose ofsomething other than the pretty lame explanation when we do get it.Actually the *spoiler alert* operation theatre I found ludicrous andfelt like there was no budget left by this stage of proceedings. Thefinal scenes are just generic chase / escape / not escape and saynothing or bring nothing new to this or any other genre.The best aspects for me are certainly Daniel Kaluuya who has a wideeyed innocent about him throughout which was very good and also asmaller part by Lakeith Lee Stanfield that felt resolved unlike most ofthe other characters.Hey I actually just read a brief article by the Director and he citesThe Stepford Wives, well..there you go Get Out, imitation is the bestfor of flattery...
