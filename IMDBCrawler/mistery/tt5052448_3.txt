Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not acomedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level,worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, alongwith a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main themeof the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. Asfar as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would workjust as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints arefrom people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracialrelationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative ofthe film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience thatit so richly deserves.
