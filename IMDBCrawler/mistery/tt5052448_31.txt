So, I saw the trailer a while ago, and thought this film looked dull.But half a year after release it still had a pretty high rating, and afriend wanted to see it. I decided to give it a chance. Waste of time.It's like a bad black mirror episode stretched double the time.SOFT SPOILERS:plot wise, the trailer pretty much tells you the whole deal. Really.And if you didn't get it from the trailer, the main characters friendbasically tells it to you point blank around half an hour in. Nomystery, no twist no nothing. Predictable and boring. HARD SPOILERS:*no, I did not predict exactly that they use the bodies for braintransplants, just the abduction, slavery and that they were all in onit parts. But that whole thing was silly and quite irrelevant(a bunchof rich white man want only black skinned individuals to put theirminds in.... really? An odd ball from the writers which seems to beaimed at pleasing specific audiences.)Besides that there are many logical flaws(so many people were abductedand Chris is the first one that has a friend look for him?? She waswith him for 4 months (!) so I'm assuming not much less with the otherguys. No one linked her to their disappearance? Really??) and not tomention the whole hypnosis/neuroscience mumbo jumbo..NO SPOILERS AHEAD:Not scary or suspenseful at all. Not horror.Plus it seems like the movie tries to pull in audiences by representingthe subject of racism as a main theme, but nothing clever about thesubject is presented. Cheap hype and bad comedy lines that come out ofthe blue.A good thing: I really enjoyed the opening scene(before the titles), itwas well crafted. Too bad it was around a minute out of an almost 2hour film..Probably around 5/10, after all plot is not the only thing in a film. Igive it a 1 to counter the (maybe fake) hype.I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THIS FILM GOT MORE THAN 7.5 ORGANICALLY.
