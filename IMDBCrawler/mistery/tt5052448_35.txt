First of all, "Get Out" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but itwasn't the best either. I heard all these great things about it, andsurprisingly it was really slow. Nothing major really happened untilalmost the end, although most of that was pretty predictable. I doappreciate the eerie feeling you get regarding the characters, which isso creepy that it keeps you wondering about what is really going onwith these people. Secondly, as a Black woman in an interracial relationship, I getexactly where Jordan Peele was going, and seeing as how he's also aBlack man who's married to a White woman, I think a lot of people needto lighten up. The film was a satire, so it's not that serious. It'ssupposed to be full of stereotypes since he was poking fun at his ownrelationship, and the old Hollywood cliché about the fact that Blackmen never make it out alive, much less to the end of horror movies. I don't need to rehash a lot of the plot, but I just couldn't get passthe whole "Stepford Wives with Black people instead of robotic clones"feeling I got while watching this movie. That's exactly what itreminded me of. At any rate, I think it was a decent effort for a directorial debut,but definitely not all it's hyped up to be.
