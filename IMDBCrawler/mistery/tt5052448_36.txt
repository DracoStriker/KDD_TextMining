The movie is okay but not very good - and especially the marketing as ahorror movie is a wrong lead - the horror-elements are really just avery few (I wasn't scared once) and also the story is not very clever(that the girl is kind of bait I did know almost right from the start).Big flaw: in a world where many white people are racists the rich whitepeople want "black skin"!? Sorry, that makes no sense at all. A scenewhere a young black guy is walking the streets and recognizes a carfollowing him and we hear him talking to himself that he wants notrouble is really a good one where I was able to emphasize with thetroubles and feelings a young black man could have in a society wherethey are often regarded as dangerous etc. - why should someone want tohave such troubles!? Ofc such people (if they would have the chance of"bodyswitching") would get the skin/body of a beautiful white man orwoman. This imo is one of the very big flaws in that movie (the storyline provides some more major flaws) and it shows hard one fact - themakers of Get Out didn't know what kind of movie they wanted to make: asatire on today's society, a horror movie, a comedy, a thriller,sci-fi, a buddy movie!? In the end we get a big mixed up cocktail whichin some parts works well and in others it doesn't - Get Out is not acocktail created by a master bartender but by an apprentice, the sum ofthe parts doesn't add up to a very good taste but taste too sweet, toosour, too whatever. Because of all that super-hype I give this movie arating of 1, real rate is something like a 4, maybe a 5. The acting isgood but nobody will remember that movie in the years to come.+ every reviewer who calls Get Out a horror movie should get his a**spanked by his mom. If this is true, every movie with some actorskissing is porn.
