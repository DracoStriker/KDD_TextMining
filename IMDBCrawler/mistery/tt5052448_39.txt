**Contains spoilers** So I decided to watch this today - I was lookingforward to seeing it as have been waiting to watch it for a while butnever been the right time. The start I thought was well done and I wanted to keep watching to seewhat had happened. It did take a long while to build up though, but itwas at a good pace and then all of a sudden you get to the point wherehe's in the chair about to be operated on and he starts killingeverybody whose in his path. 1. He doesn't strike me to be the'violent' type. 2. He had never been in that part of the house previousso how all of a sudden does he know his way around?A lot of these sorts of films start off really good and intriguing butthen they rush the ending. And want to finish the 3/4 - end part of thefilm quickly. It gets stupid, surely they could of thought aboutfinishing it cleaner and more idealistic than how it ended. I was quiet disappointed!
