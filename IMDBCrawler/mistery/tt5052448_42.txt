While the first half of the film is getting increasingly weird andbuilds up some really scary scenes like the first hypnotism scene, ataround the two-third mark it just starts to become so much absurd andgrotesque, that it actually turns increasingly funny and not very muchscary any more. The racist clichés are thrown around in a way that theybecome a rather shallow caricature of racism, and the scene where Rodexplains his theory to the police about rich white people abductingblack people to make them their brainwashed slaves actually summarizesvery well how satyric the whole setup truly is. I couldn't decide howmuch intentional or not that was, but I liked this change - while itruins the creepy atmosphere, it makes the movie more than the "average"horror movie.It's a very much enjoyable, well made movie - it's just not a horror,but a satire.
