Despite being an entertaining and well played by actors + skillfullystructured by the director and the crew, it is a terribly biased anddivisive film. There is no even one positive white character. Not evenneutral. Just black (good/victim) and white(menacing/racist/predatory...etc).Besides, the medical/neurosurgical premise is ridiculous. Although,it's not that important. Some reviewers, gullible and well meaning, overlooked this centralpoint and effect of the movie. These "people" would vote for Obama?!Pleeeeease.
