Jordan Peel's writing and directing were promising. I expected ahilarious horror movie, which I like a lot. Or at least (according tohigh ranking on IMDb) a very good horror movie. None of these. Thefirst thing ? this is not a horror movie. Maybe just a little bit. Thesecond thing ? this is not a comedy either. This one is too serious fora comedy. There were some jokes, but I didn't think the jokes werefunny enough. I'm not an American, and sometimes I enjoy some littleracist jokes in American movies. But all of these were so muchstereotyped and clichéd? According to what Jordan Peel said about thismovie, he was inspired by the Night of the Dead (1968). As to me, thiswas more a poor Jango remake. Pros: Acting is very good. Story looksoriginal. That is it. Cons: It's not a Horror movie. Not much ofMystery genre here too, because it's too obvious. Thriller ? a littlebit. Not funny. Some poor pacing. Writing sucks too much.
