An offbeat horror film and satirical social commentary about race inAmerica where the upper middle class liberals are the creepy villainsand their political correctness is actually an overcompensation to maskthe disturbing prejudices that lurk beneath. The film takes a detourfrom the conventional formula of the paranoid community-conspiracythriller, but it's ultimately just an update on 'The Stepford Wives'with a racial twist.This is an assured debut from comedian Jordan Peele, helped by anacutely OTT Hitchcockian score and some winning performances, withparticular noteworthy turns from Bradley Whitford, who is perfectlycast as the overeager and sinister father, and Daniel Kaluuya, whobalances that 'meet the parents' awkward politeness with a jagged edgeof paranoia. There are many squirm in your seat moments - some of whichare just the scenes where the thinly-veiled animosity and racialsubtext bubble beneath the surface of the dialogue - and the unsettlingatmosphere of the piece keeps you digesting in the dark underbelly ofrich white suburbia right alongside Kaluuya's protagonist.Peele manages to keep the story taut for the first hour, withheightened moments of almost comical tension, leaving the viewer unsureas to when things will spill over into pure horror, which it inevitablydoes. And once all the cards are put on the table much of the tensiondeflates and the situations become more arch and silly, from the weakcomic relief sidekick subplot to the unnecessary expository villainy.All subtly and nuance is suddenly jettisoned at the tap of a teaspoonand Peele lowers the bar by over-explaining everything to his audience,perhaps the only real sign of his inexperience as a cinematicstoryteller.The other major problem with the film is that it's too predictable interms of its plot to fulfill the thriller criteria of shock andsurprise. There is never much doubt as to what is really happening andthat takes away from the experience somewhat, but 'Get Out' is still anerve-jangling tale for about an hour and change even though the thirdact is pure hokum. The best way to look at this is as a very twisted'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' for millennials.
