After sitting through two and a third long hours of "IT" recently,being bored mostly by the predictable CGI and the usual jolts intoday's so called horror films, I just watched "Get Out". I wasn'texpecting much, as the DVD had 5 mediocre to awful previews. But almostimmediately, I became intensely involved by the plot and quality ofthis film, which mixes social satire and racial issues brilliantly.This is not like most horror films today, but rather more like suspensethrillers as "The Stepford Wives", "the Harvest", or "The Tall Man".The scares are not like jolts, but rather stem from the nervous feelingthat kept me glued to the screen, anxious to see what will happen next.I just learned this was the director's first film, though it seemed tohave excellent production values and built suspense seamlessly. I lovestories where something strange is going on, and the mystery isgradually revealed, like the original "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"or "Night Of The Living Dead". For those not looking for gore orshocks, but rather suspense, this should satisfy most of you. But ifspecial effects are your preference, maybe stay away.
