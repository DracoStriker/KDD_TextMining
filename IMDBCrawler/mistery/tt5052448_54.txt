This is the worst movie I've seen in several years at least. The moviestarts off slow but somewhat interesting. As soon as the plot getsgoing 30 minutes into the movie it's just completely ridiculous. If youknow anything about hypnosis or basic logic you won't be able to watchthis movie. The writer doesn't even attempt to makes sense or isn'tcapable of doing so. My girlfriend and I both had enough after 30-40minutes. In the past 30 years this is maybe the 3rd movie I couldn'twatch till the end.
