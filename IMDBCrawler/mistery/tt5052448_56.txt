It would be wrong to say that this is not a good film, unfortunatelyone that has been over hyped. If I had watched it without knowing thehype and rave reviews, it would likely have earned an extra starrating.No need to discuss the plot but the film sits in the mystery/horrorgenre slot. I thought it was a comedy-horror going in, but it isn't. Infact the undertone to the film has quite a dark and sociallychallenging agenda.Though is the film a new fresh take on the horror genre as some reviewshave suggested, well, erm, no. All though there is some astutedirection in building the suspense, Get Out does end up following thestandard horror narrative. The last 25 minutes is particularly typicalas our central character desperately tries to 'get out' of the badsituation.Would still recommend watching this film, just don't get too excited.
