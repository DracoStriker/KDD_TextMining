I can't believe the high score on this film. I'm a massive film fan andthis is one of my favorite genres so trust me when I say this is veryvery overrated. The humor falls short and it is not scary in theslightest. Let's be honest, this is the same propaganda that is in thenews right now with the black lives matter and Trump rubbish. This ishighly irresponsible and offensive to any white person and if the filmwas the other way around with whites and blacks then there would be amassive backlash. How many films now play the race or sexism card now?!This film is a blatant rip off of Skeleton Key but Skeleton Key isactually a good film so ignore all the reviews on this film cause Ican't help but think it just mirrors the sad state of the victimmentality and racism that is all the rage right now. Avoid!!
