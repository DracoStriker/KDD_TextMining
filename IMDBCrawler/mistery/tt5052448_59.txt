I have not seen this movie, and I don't need to. Ever since I saw thepreview I could tell immediately that it was a rip-off of The StepfordWives, only with a trendy anti-white people theme. It simply bafflesthe mind that people here are calling it "original, an instant classic"or even "a masterpiece"!! Seriously?! I do not need or desire to seethis movie. As other reviewers have suggested - I do not want tosupport the ideologies it promotes financially or socially.I think my favorite review I have read here that perfectly sums up theproblem with this movie was by a woman who was visiting the USA fromanother country. She said she was truly shocked by the black peoplethat were all around her in the audience who were cheering loudly eachtime one of the white characters got killed.So it is essentially worse than just a rip-off because in The StepfordWives white people were victimizing other whites. Instead of justturning that around and setting it in a rich all black neighborhood andhave it be black-on-black crime ( which is a REAL problem that shouldbe addressed) Peele decided to depict the affluent whites doinghorrible Nazi-style experiments to the poor unsuspecting black victims.A masterpiece indeed - of the propaganda variety. It is reallydisturbing to see that it is doing so well and getting such praisingreviews.
