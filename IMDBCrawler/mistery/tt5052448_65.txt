"Get Out" starts strongly, with several chilling moments, but doesn'tquite come together in the end.For most of its run-time, it is a rebuttal to anyone who thinks thatthe horror genre cannot be socially relevant. From its opening scenesreminding us of Trayvon Martin, to the protagonist meeting affluenttypes at a party, none of whom can avoid mentioning his ethnicity,aspects of "Get Out" feel almost too timely and on-point, perhapsuncomfortably so, which is, of course, a great place to set a horrormovie.The movie shows its hand pretty early, which is not necessarily a badthing. The problem is that it has you primed for a big reveal, and Ifound myself a bit let down by the climax and its conclusion. Thebeginning was handled so skilfully, I was obviously hoping it wouldcontinue in kind. However, it went too far into standard horrorterritory in the end, and seemed to lose touch with the socialconscience that had made its first act so interesting.
