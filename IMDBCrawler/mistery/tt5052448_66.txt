Game-changing horror with incendiary racial agenda? Er, no. This ismore Society or The Man With Two Brains than Mississippi Burning -total B-movie territory. How anyone could suggest it has anythingrelevant to say about black identity or the legacy of slavery in theAmerican psyche is beyond me. It's not a reflection of simmering racialtensions in modern America so much as a reflection of the current trendin Hollywood for massive overcompensation, following the storm at lastyear's Oscars. It's probably going too far to say this film is racistbecause it's Crayola level, too dumb to be taken seriously, but if yousimply flipped the script and had a credible white lead surrounded byridiculous black stereotypes, accusations would definitely fly!As a horror, it's barely adequate but gets a few points for keeping meintrigued for a while before I clued into where it was headed and myeyes gradually rolled further and further back into my sockets. I getthe distinct feeling I wasn't watching this with a seasoned horrorcrowd tonight either - I can't remember the last time I heard peoplescreaming with such little provocation and oo-ing and ah- ing at themost obvious of plot points. As a comedy, it's mildly amusing. Humouris a very subjective thing though of course - if you find Chris Rock'sstand up hilarious, the chances are you'll be rolling in the aisles atthis too.
