What a great movie this is! It really gets under your skin in a goodkind of way.. Unsuspecting turns which makes your mind go in multipledirections - all wrong. Brilliant acting & cast and great music. It isno horror movie, maybe this label scares people off. Yeah it has somehorror aspects in it, but it is more like a high level psychologicalthriller. The story is straightforward, but well connected. Near theend, everything comes together. No loose ends. Definitely one of thebetter movies I've seen in this genre over the last couple of years. Gosee it!
