Something is wrong from the very beginning. The opening scene shows a black guy being attacked and put in the trunkof a car. Then we meet Chris (amazingly played by Daniel Kaluuya), also a blackguy, and his white girlfriend Rose. They're gonna go visit Rose'sparents who lives in a secluded estate in the country. They are veryfriendly, almost too friendly. Except from Jeremy, Rose's creepybrother. The reason I'm mentioning race at all, is because it's an importantpart of the plot. Nothing is however as it seems at the estate. I can't say anything elsewithout ruining it. But this is genius film-making. If a horror movieshould ever get Academy Awards, for best script and best movie and bestlead "Get Out" is it.Everything from the way its filmed, to the music, to the acting, it'spure genius. It's mostly psychological horror, mixed with a littlegore.A must see for horror fans that want intelligent adult horror, withoutcheap jump scares or clowns or annoying kids. But truly scary horror. Watch this. You will not regret it.
