Kidding with hypnosis, giving life and rebuilding awful false mythsfrom the past century. Ridiculous ideas really. The movie has its valueon interpretations. Only that. Big disappointment because the movie hasgreat actors, scenario...but for god sake, anyone who knows hypnosis oranyone with his feet on the ground knows how irrational this movie is.And please don't even call it "fiction" , because that's not theassumption of the movie.
