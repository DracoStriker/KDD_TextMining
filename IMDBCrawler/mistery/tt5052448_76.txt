While the premise is quality and the on-screen chemistry between DanielKaluuya and Allison Williams was great - the movie fell a bit flat forme. The writing could have gone in a number of different creativedirections and the final script was not the best choice.I left the movie without feeling the overall scope of the difficultywith inter racial dating in the United States. Which could have been aterrific arc, especially with the political leanings of Rose's (AllisonWilliams) father. Instead the movie turned into a basic thrillerafterwards.The overall acting was good, the music was fine, and there weren't anymajor editing flaws. However, I was expecting far more from this film.Overall Score: 6.2
