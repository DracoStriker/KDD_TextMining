the newest film made by jordan peele lives out to the hype that itmade.horror comedy is one of the hardest genres(or sub genres) to makea movie about.some good examples would be evil dead 2 and scream.thefilm actually takes a subject like racism and makes it into a parody ofitself.the comedy of the movie is actually really subtle and your'e notgonna walk into the movie and start laughing as a joke comes along.itsa realization that can be made while watching the film or after youwatched it.it can't be really called a satire of horror movies becauseit uses the horror movie clichés more than once but the good part isthat i doesn't annoy you like a lot of horror movies do.one of thestrengths of the movie is that you don't need to be an American tounderstand the story.a basic knowledge about racism will be enough.butfor the clues and metaphors that are in the movie you need to pay moreattention and know a little bit more.there are no jokes in the movieand even the comedy relief character lil rel howery doesn't make jokesbut sells its comedy by his performance which makes him actually funnyand not just an annoying side character like we see mostly in themovies right now.the performances are great and the character choicesare rational and logical unlike most horror movies we see today.allisonwilliams does a pretty good job and actually nails the character farmore better than i expected.the cinematography is pretty good but itgot distracting in two or three places of the movie but it wasn'tboring and actually kept the movie pretty good looking.the twists ofthe movie will actually kinda predictable but that wasn't what themovie was about and i didn't expected to be shocked since the moviedoesn't take itself to seriously but serious enough to keep the plotgoing.the CGI blood were kinda distracting and the movie got slow in afew places but it had the pay-off and you were rewarded after thescenes.the movie is well made and deserves a second viewing in sometime and i would recommend it to horror fans or if your'e a fan ofsubtle humor and comedy.
