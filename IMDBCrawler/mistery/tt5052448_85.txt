Let me just start with that i heard a lot about this movie,peoplepraising it how original and refreshing it is.I didn't really get thatimpression.My thoughts are that the movie was a huge clusterfu#k ofunfunny childish comedy and the worst "horror elements" I've seen in amovie.Its like the film cant decide if it wants to be a comedy or ahorror flick.Don't even get me started with the most cliché charactersever.And the IMDb ratting,an eight really?Its insulting for the otherfilms that are way better but have lower scores.
