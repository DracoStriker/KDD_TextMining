The genius of this movie was all the hype about it and the sheep whofed the hype. I looked at a few sites to see what it was rated andfigured my wife and I like some psychological horror... why not. Geniusmovie on an epic level for me even though I rated it 1 star out of 10.The true genius of this movie is showing to my wife and I how alone weare in this world/country and that we're surrounded by a minority ofactual humans but now a majority of sheep. I am so honored to havewatched this movie to now see so clearly this visceral portrait ofAmerica's idiocy unfolding.When the movie ended and it faded to black and those powerful words"Get Out" came up, I knew right then and there that this blockbuster ofa movie had finally solidified my mind into knowing I am surrounded byimbecilic sheep out there. I had once doubted and thought maybe it wasmy age of 45 starting to show through and thinking "Man, am I gettingold? Is this how it starts?" but this movie transcends all agerestrictions. Stupidity and zombie-like hype needs no age, no race, noculture ... it can shuffle forward slowly like a plague and consumemore and more as we tick tock through the years to come.Bravo!
