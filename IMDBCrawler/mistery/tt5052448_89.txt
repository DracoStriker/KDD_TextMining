I watched the movie last night at cinema. As an idea, was innovated andafter I saw 8.2/10 I thought myself "why not"? Didn't even worth the3.75 euros spent for a ticket. As a comedy was pretty cool, but as ahorror movie SUCKS. Best part was LilRel Howery's part. As for bonus:20 year-old guy, sitting next to me was scared and had his eyesclosed!!! Nice audience as it goes for rating movies..
