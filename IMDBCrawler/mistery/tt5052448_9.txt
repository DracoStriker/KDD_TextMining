I felt little more than pity for Peele after watching this movie. Hissad fantasy view of white people and their motives towards black peoplereveals a disturbed and paranoid world view.In some of his comedic work, he seems to be mocking this kind ofparanoia, but in Get Out he's embraced it as justified. Maybe I wasjust giving him too much credit before (I'm thinking of his skit withwhite zombies that won't eat black people).If a white author wrote a similar story, projecting his paranoidvisions of black stereotypes onto fictional black characters (who, ofcourse, are mere puppets and who have no actual control over theiractions), he would be reviled and the picture canned or banned.However, our modern double standard allows Peele to get away with. Infact, he's apparently now celebrated for it.In addition to the above, it's just generally not an interesting story.It's highly rated, and I was looking forward to a good horror film, butit's not.If you're a minority who wants validation for your paranoia, or a whiteperson who wants to wallow in white guilt, you might get something outof it. If not, then no.
