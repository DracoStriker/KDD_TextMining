Plot was terrible. Just another white people are bad with a sciencefiction twist. I'm not sure who these films appeal to. Really wish Icould have that 1 hour and a half of my life back. This film doesn'tmake you think or expand on any critical thinking. It's just plain bad.Acting was OK. Scenery was OK. No notable lines.
