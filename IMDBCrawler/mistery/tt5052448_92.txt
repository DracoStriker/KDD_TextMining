I wonder if I can press charges against Jordan Peele, for ROBBING me of104 minutes?There's nothing new, or refreshing about this horrible "movie". It's nobetter than a WWII Nazi propaganda film. There's no "social commentary"in this atrocious excuse of a movie, BUT it's definitely riddled withracist agitprop. It's like an SJW's version of Orwell's ANIMALFARM..."Black people gooood...white people baaaad!". Instead ofcreating a film that would help revitalize a quickly stagnating genre,Jordan Peele has created nothing more than a piece of propagatingfilth. Rather than trying to make a film showing the unity of the humanrace, he drives a wedge of contention between the races...furtherfueling bigotry, and hate. It's pompousness, and arrogance that strokesthe flames, NOT genius. If I could rate this drivel less than 1, Iwould. Stay far, far away from this!!!
