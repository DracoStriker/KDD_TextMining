I honestly cannot see why people are praising this film as some sort ofmasterpiece, the "horror" that it boasts can only be compared to thatof a 2006 YouTube Poop video, it's story contains MASSIVE continuityerrors and the acting is complete and utter garbage. If you arethinking of watching this film and are in your right mind then I pleadyou to simply ignore it and let it die out.
