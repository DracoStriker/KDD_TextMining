Bottom line, as a horror movie it was not scary. As a psychologicalthriller, it was completely unbelievable and devoid of any real worldresearch or knowledge. As a mystery, it was not a mystery and extremelyobvious. The allegory (which was intended), was completely racist andnot ashamed to say so right to your face... white people are evil andapparently that group likes to exploit blacks. Which, in todays world,is completely bologna. All groups exploit every other including theirown (blacks especially), so in other words its not a race problem, itsa societal problem (caused by bad economic and social policies but thatis a argument for another time).I think people saw what they wanted to see and not what was actuallyshown. Most of the reviews are clearly not objective and veryemotionally driven because the reviewer agreed with the allegory (thereviewer already had an opinion and the movie reinforced it). Ratherthan talk about the quality of the movie, they talk about symbolism asif the authors and directors are geniuses of some sort. They aren't andsince most psychology is monkey business as has been proved time andagain in the real world by psychiatrists (real doctors and researchers)there was nothing left of the movie but a hallow shell.Skip it if you have a functioning brain. You will be bored to tears andyou will spot every statistical and logical error of which there are somany that the movie became comical.
