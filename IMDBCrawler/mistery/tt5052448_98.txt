Lol just because you add famous character it doesn't mean that moviewill be famous. This is the worst movie I have seen in 20's I don'tknow what now a days people are looking in horror movies? seriouslythis movie is at the bottom of all the list of movies I created. Don'tjudge the rating these are all I guess made by movie cast or something.Save money and don't watch it not like the movie you are thinking off.strange direction zero moment and no story line at all. Overrated ashell! sorry but these days people need a therapy for knowing whathorror movies really are!
