The premise for Get Out is interesting and makes for an unusual horror.The premise, although good, deteriorates into clichés by the end, neverfully fleshing out any of the characters and injecting humour where itdoesn't really fit. The opening credits (and song) are haunting andevocative but the film itself portrays the characters as onedimensional. All of the white characters are evil and all of the blackcharacters are victim. As usual, in Americas depiction of race, thereis no middle ground, only white and black; no biracial, no latino, noNative American, only one Asian character randomly thrown in.Although the film itself was fine if not rewatchable, what disturbed memost was sitting in an audience of black movie goers who cheered thedeaths of all white people and made horrible comments.As a horror lover, I have never seen even the worst killer or on-screenmurder cheered, and yet the audience lapped it up because white peoplewere being killed (even if they were the villains). This unsettled me.I'm not American and so my countries issues with race are not on parwith Americas. To see the audience react this way felt odd, as if I hadbeen transported to America. I almost feel like the film set racerelations back! Ultimately, an interesting horror but more of a 'cheapshot' at evil ol' Whitey. The depths are never really explored.
