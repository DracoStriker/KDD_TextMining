yet again, been duped and led astray by the all mighty trailer gods;what a waste of celluloid. Horror films enthusiasts, really. Great ideayet poorly executed. A lot of drama for a horror film, hints ofDawson's Creek. A college girl wakes up in a horny student's room,confused and baffled. She's hungover. She lives her day hanging outwith her sorority. She walks down a bunch of stairs at night with nolights to guide her and no one in sight (at this point, you turn aroundand run like the wind) She sees a small toy underneath a bridge. Shecautiously inspects it then boom here comes trouble. A weirdo appearswearing a mask and kills her. She wakes up again and we start the wholeboredom all over again. The killer is obvious and in the end I leavethinking I've seen this film before.
