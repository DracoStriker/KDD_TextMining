I'm starting to see a trend develop in modern horror movies (the goodones at least) and I really like it. Film makers are beginning torealise that for horror to work there has to be some different levelsto the film. 90 minutes of watching people get killed isn't going to beable to cut it anymore. You have to be able to make the audience laugh,think and even move them emotionally. If you can do that then your filmwill be a success. Earlier this year 'Get Out' pulled it off and now'Happy Death Day' has nailed it too.When the opening logos featured a joke (literally in the first fewseconds of the film) I thought I may have misread the tone of the filmin the trailers. Turns out I had, but in a good way. It wasn't anindication that the film was to be a laugh-fest, simply that it hadthat layer to it. And the thing about the layers that the filmpossesses it that every one of them works. Whatever it tries to pulloff it manages.The twists and turns and how crafty it is about concealing them trulyblew me away. At least three times I thought to myself such and suchelement would be better if they'd done so and so, only to later findout they did indeed have that up their sleeve the whole time. The filmis incredibly smart.I can't say enough good things about this film. The trailers won't givea fair indication to people of what this film is truly capable of, andso sadly I fear many who would love it will not get around to seeingit. If you get the chance though please do see it. It's a fantasticfilm and you won't be disappointed.
