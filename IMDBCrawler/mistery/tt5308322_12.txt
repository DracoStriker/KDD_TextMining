**My review reveals the murderer:The main character was so blatantly stupid that it ruined this movie. Iwas enjoying it for the most part but there were things which justdrove me crazy. The main thing that did it for me and made me feel likeI just wasted 2 hours of my time was when the main character, Treetakes a knife to a police officer's throat and takes his gun, just totell him that a prisoner is about to escape. She therefore goes intothe medical bay with a gun and ends up shooting the patient/suspectwithout any subsequent charges or punishment. Also, it's obvious afterthe first few times of dying that she only needs to see the face of hermurderer, but each time she gets close to him she does something stupidand runs away instead of trying to de-mask her assailant. I justthought this movie was bad for those reasons. It had the "stupidblonde" appeal to it which gets old in my honest opinion. It wasobvious that the murderer was her roommate from the beginning becauseshe was outrageously nice, they could have done a better job not makingit so obvious. I did like the performance of her roommate, however.Also, the main character Tree was very self-absorbed and conceited, Ididn't like her despite the character development she experiencedthrough her subsequent lives. The movie wasn't AWFUL but it was hard for me to love. I wouldtruthfully give it a 5/10 rating due to the stupid decisions of themain character, but I had to drop it a little lower because there's noway it deserves a near 7/10 as the community seems to believe. Removethe stupid decisions and make a smart protagonist we can respect, andthe movie would have been a 7/10 easy, maybe even higher.It's basically like Triangle/Butterfly Effect/Edge of Tomorrow,although I don't think it deserves a better score than those movies.
