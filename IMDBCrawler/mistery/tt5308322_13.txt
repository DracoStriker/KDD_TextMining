I like this type of movies based on time loop. I watched all the mostfamous movies of this genre, like Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow,Dejavu, Donnie Darko, Looper Tringle and Predestination. This summer Isaw Before I Fall and I like it very much. Also Happy Death Day is notbad, but I think that Before I Fall is more intense and explains betterthe circularity of the time and the goal that the main character haveto achieve at the end. Happy Death is a very funny movie, Jessica Rotheis very well immersed in the role, but the plot in some points is alittle bit weak, for example in the part of the wanted fugitive in thehospital. In conclusion, I think that this film is good andentertaining for passing a evening but in the future I will notremember it as a masterpiece of the time loop genre.
