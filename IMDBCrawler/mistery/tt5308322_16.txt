The surprise of the year, well so far. Once in a while, there comes amovie which will be painfully awful or brilliantly excellent! HappyDeath day is brilliant in a 80's campy horror movies way! A fresh moviepremise of a female college student who is murdered and must relive thesame day over and over again until she solves the murder. Problem isthe protagonist aka Tree Gelbman is evil; the list of enemies is waytoo many! What makes Happy Death day way too cool is the details. Thecollege life and characters are so accurate. There is the snotty femalerival, the activist, the nice guy etc that everyone knew in college. Ilove the sarcasm of the snotty sorority gal. The movie is so so un- P Cwhich creates a guilty pleasure. There are a few cool slasher horrormovie moments which pay homage to Friday 13th and Scream. Then thereare a few plot devices which keeps the audience guessing. A few sceneswhich throws the audience into a loop, and then Happy Death Day has ahorror plot twist game changer which is just classic aka memorable. 9out of 10 stars.
