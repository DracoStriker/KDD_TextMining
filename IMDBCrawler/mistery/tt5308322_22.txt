I'm seriously surprised by how for an enjoyable, entertaining, grippingand engaging this film turned out to be! Every instance of her murderbrings with it new thrills and new revelation and every time you feelas if you will end up dying with her. Its length is merely 97 minutesbut it engages you so much as a viewer that you end up getting thefeeling of having watched a four-hour long film.There must be flaws in this film, I doubt not, but I'll be amazed ifpeople managed to find faults in a film that runs at such a relentlesspace. I was so awestruck by it that I couldn't.It brings its lessons too. It makes her realise the fault in heractions (such as the affair with a married man), the sacrificial loveof Carter who trusted and helped her each time she asked of him, herharsh stance towards her father and all in all makes her realise thevalue of life and being grateful - although just when you thought so,it still doesn't solve her problem, and in that lies the beauty of thisfilm.Not to mention its biggest quality though, which is the way the thrillsare wrapped in comedy. In general, despite the horror moments due tothe murder(s), you still will watch this film with a smile on yourface.
