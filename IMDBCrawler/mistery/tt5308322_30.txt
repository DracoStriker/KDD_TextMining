I have noticed that many others reviewers qualified this movie as ahorror and comedy, even in the title of their reviews. I'm not sure whythey do so, but it's not like that for me. It's a mystery and a SFthriller in the first place, and only then a horror. Of course, horrorelements and action are here, but it's restrained and more suspense.Especially, as someone said, because the movie doesn't take itself tooseriously. That's how I experienced it. Thanks someone for that. Also,it's not a comedy per Se. There's no intentional jokes, they comes fromthe situation. Which is good. Just like a Groundhog Day. That's whatthis movie is, Groundhog Day for younger generations. And it does apretty good job, by my opinion. Nice all in one package. I'm free tothink that is a little more than a this year Halloween hit. It willlast.
