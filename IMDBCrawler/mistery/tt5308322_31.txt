If you get a strong sense of déjà vu watching Happy Death Day, that'sbecause it takes the basic premise of Bill Murray classic Groundhog Dayand adds a whole heap of familiar slasher clichés. But whilstundeniably derivative, the film still manages to be huge fun. At firstone wonders whether it will succeed in offering anything beyond itshigh-concept mash-up premise, but as things progress it becomes clearthat we're in safe hands, writer Scott Lobdell delivering a clever andwitty script with director Christopher Landon confidently handling theaction so that repetition never seems boring.Replacing Murray's obnoxious weatherman is attractive but self-obsessedsorority bitch Tree (Jessica Rothe) whose birthday brings an unexpectedsurprise?death!?a psycho in a mask attacking her as she makes her wayto a party. To Tree's horror, she is forced to relive the day again andagain until she can work out the identity of her murderer and preventherself from being killed. As in Groundhog Day, Tree is able to changethe course of her repeated day with the knowledge she has gleaned, andultimately becomes a much nicer person in the process. In the AndieMacDowell role is Israel Broussard as nice guy Carter Davis, who triesto help Tree with her terrible predicament.Equal parts wry comedy and PG friendly horror, Happy Death Day isn'tabout to scare your socks off, but thanks to fine performances from asolid cast, some imaginative plot twists, and a snappy pace, it's stillhugely entertaining stuff that should appeal to horror and non-horrorfans alike.
