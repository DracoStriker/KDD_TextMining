I thought this was just a cheap slasher movie version of groundhog day. Oddly enough it was. Girl wakes up in a dorm room goes about her daythen gets murdered before the day ends just to repeat the day again andagain with her murder hiding they're identity behind a mask. Here is the surprise though. This movie is actually good! The girl isthe stereotypical bitchy (or witchy if they've censored the movie likethey did over here) cheerleader. Pretty much every single person in herlife has a reason to want her dead. This works as you go through thelist of suspects (sometimes hilariously) and don't feel bad seeing herdie over and over. It more then earns the big reveal in the end and I found it to be a funlight hearted popcorn movie for Halloween. This movie got one extra point for being bold enough to actuallystraight up say "hey, you know what your story reminds me off?Groundhog day, that movie with Bill Murray." right at the end beforethe closing credits.
