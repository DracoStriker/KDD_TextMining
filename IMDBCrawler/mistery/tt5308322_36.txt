What was so fun with the horror movies in the 90s was how they madepeople unlikable before giving us the joy of murdering them. Theactress was incredible at being unbearable, I was excited to see her bekilled... repeatedly.I was disappointed by the lack of gore, but then I appreciated it as aclever suspense. And it sure delivered. She powerfully expressed herpsychological distress.It was very fun, movies that laugh at themselves are the best comedies.It was actually deep and inspiring too about personal maturity andsocial interactions.Seeing her relive the same day didn't feel repetitive, she doesn't justmake different choices, her attitude becomes different too. I wasn'texpecting much, but even when I do, I rarely get twists and endingsthis interesting. I'll gladly watch again!I'm happy that more movies are using the Groundhog Day idea. Edge ofTomorrow was also interesting if you like science fiction.
