i was happy with everything about this movie, except about who thekiller was, to me i think they could of explained it better, like howthey got there at a certain time, and how they knew to be there and allthat kind of stuff. lets just say, the twist made more since than theother theory. but the movie is defiantly worth a watch. and i think therating on this movie, is fair.
