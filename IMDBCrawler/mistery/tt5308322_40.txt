The premise of this film is what gives it 4 of the 6 stars I havegiven. It's actually a really smart plot, yet it is executed ratherpoorly, which is such a shame considering that if the film took itselfa little more seriously, it could genuinely be put into contention asone of the great Psychological Thrillers of recent years. That is theproblem, it's more "fun" than "thrilling". The story and ingenuity start to slow down as the film goes on, withboth gently coming to a halt by the final 10 minutes of the film, soit's a downward slope from (pretty much) the start but it does manageto cling on to its entertainment value long enough to be worthwatching.Don't expect a masterpiece, it's just a bit of fun.
