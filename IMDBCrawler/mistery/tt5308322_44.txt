This is not an intellectual movie, it's very repetitive and the genresof this movie is not correct at all. It's more of an comedy mixed withromance and some mildly jump-scares. Not a movie suited for mepersonally at all, although some of my emotional friends did enjoy it.I don't know how this got all the hype it got because it is not worthwatching, I wanted to leave the cinema after the third rollback.
