I had low expectations and I have to say they were totally exceeded . This is an enjoyable Romantic Horror with more than a passing referenceto GROUNDHOG DAY - and the occasional reminiscing of the 15 year oldShaun of the dead . Plus a bit of Scream , scary movie and a number ofother slasher movies . Jessica Roshe was brilliant in the starring role , you believe in hercharacter , her charm was endearing and despite the 10 years betweenher character and actual age she played the combination of innocentromantic with a touch a modern feisty independent female in control ofher own destiny . The only poor point was how the inevitable twist was handled - thatcould have been slightly better but definitely worth seeing . Pad.A 7/10
