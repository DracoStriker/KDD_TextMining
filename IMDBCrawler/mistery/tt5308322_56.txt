A poisonous sorority has inundated Bayford University with bitterrivals. A calorie cutting agenda cuts the crop of wishful debutantes,while 3 a.m. pledge inductions bloat testosterone and deplete respect.A mire of social cannibalism, the school common reeks ofmisappropriated ambitions.Tree, a sisterhood loyal, wakes in a pseudo-nerd's dorm room from apainfully obvious and contradicting ring tone. The three letter wordilluminating from her screen elicits audible disdain. The seeds ofselfishness are planted as she bosses around the servant boy who neverdeserved to care for her.Karma should never be laughed at, but here it is a tone-deaf joke. Treehas ample opportunities to correct her putrid elitism, but even deathneeds a few semesters' worth of lectures to make a dent in herobnoxious personality. With protagonist that even the mostcondescending individual would despise, the narrative throws all stakesin a fiery garbage bin where its victimizing one liners should haverested.When a film's universe is intrinsically tethered to time, it becomesinexcusable to disregard time frames entirely. The viewer becomespunished when they dive into the intricacies of the events that thefilm subjugates upon the audience repeatedly. No matter how long Treestalls in waking moments, or how swiftly she jets out of the stranger'sdoor, a timer starts when it is most convenient for the pitiful visualgags to wear themselves out.A heavy handed score mixed with the most "paper due at midnight" twistpush this narrative into new depths of apathetic storytelling. Avoidthis film if you have a weak neck, because you are bound to shake yourhead every two minutes. No laughs are intentional, and this memenursery only succeeds in being needlessly offensive.
