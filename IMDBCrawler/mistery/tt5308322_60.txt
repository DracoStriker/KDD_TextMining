Is there a day in your life which you would want to do over? And if itwere possible what day would that be? In the movie Happy Death Day themain character gets a do-over. It's up to her to use that in order tofigure out who the person is that kills her. This movie kind ofreminded me of A Christmas Carol mixed with Groundhog Day.So, this movie is about a girl who wakes up to the same day. And notjust any day, the day she was murdered. On top of that it's also herbirthday. I feel like it must suck to get killed on your birthday, buthey at least you get to eat cake over and over again. At first, when Isaw the trailer, I thought this was a comedy but this movie is morelike a romantic horror. And like any horror this movie involves a lotof moments where I was talking to the screen. "Look behind you", "Omg,she's so stupid", "How is that even possible", you know, the basics.Even with the typical horror mistakes this movie has, it really isworth a watch.
