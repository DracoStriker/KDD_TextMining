We all totally know from the trailer that this is just some homage from"Groundhog Day", but we like it. From the trailer, we know that thismovie will be so interesting & we just watch it. I don't know what tosay anymore, it's so good! Imagine a light sorority teenmovie+slasher+g-day and it will be a total carnival. It's so fun youwish it never gonna end. Even though you maybe will feel sympathy forher but it's not as easy as you expected. 10 for a good time!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
