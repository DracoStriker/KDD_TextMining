The trailer for "Happy Death Day" doesn't do the actual movie justice,something we see the other way around more often. I have to admit thatpartially because of this I was skeptical about it, only to bepleasantly surprised by the time the credits rolled. Don't get mewrong, in no way is this film supposed to be taken too seriously, yet Iam glad that one is not forced to completely lower their standards toenjoy it. Jessica Rothe's performance is great, even in the beginning of themovie where she is pretty much a total douche bag to everyone shesomehow manages to come of quite charming and charismatic. And that'sthe thing about Happy Death Day; it's not necessarily a cinematicmasterpiece, yet it has some kind of easy breezy charm to it whichmakes you curious. The writers make the audience play a guessing game, more specifically"who killed me?" by (quite cleverly) introducing all suspects on thefirst day. Then it's up to the audience to decide who is most likely,or better yet unlikely the killer. The answer was neither shocking norpredictable, that's the only thing that left me unimpressed. Instead ofhaving that "omg no way" moment you will probably be more like "huh?wait? it was them?". The reveal of the killer to be confusing is a flawthat cannot be overlooked, because it is what the entire movie has ledup to.But other than that Happy Death Day was an entertaining watch, I wouldespecially love to see more from Jessica Rothe. In a way the story linefeels like a homage to the oh-so lovable classics it has drawninspiration from. I guess that's reason enough to go and check it out.Be sure not to go into it too critically tough, it's hard to take amovie serious when the ones poking most fun at it (in an innocent way)are the creators themselves.
