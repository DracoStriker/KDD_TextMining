'Happy Death Day' is a horror-comedy that very knowingly takes the coreconceit of (or at least popularised by) 'Groundhog Day (1993)' andsmashes it together with the slasher genre, but where most pictures ofthe kind would try to scare or shock this one solely sets its sights ontrying to entertain, using the language and influences of both itsprimary styles to provide a roller-coaster ride that has a good amountof edge but also knows when to pull back and have some fun; the resultis a piece which isn't scary and isn't funny but is certainly enjoyablethroughout, even if the ultimate 'whodunnit' reveals are a littledisappointing and the machinations of the plot never quite come fullcircle to the point that a few holes start to emerge, and actuallymanages to maintain a decent and non-repetitive pace that doesn't apeits most key inspiration all too often (though it does do it, in thebroadest strokes, on a number of occasions.) 7/10
