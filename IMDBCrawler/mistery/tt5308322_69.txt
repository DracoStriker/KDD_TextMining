'HAPPY DEATH DAY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A horror film about a college student that's murdered on her birthday,and then keeps waking up the previous morning, having to repeat thesame day until she can find out who her killer is and stop them. It wasdirected by Christopher B. Landon (who also helmed the 2015 zombiehorror flick 'SCOUTS GUIDE TO THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE'), and it waswritten by Scott Lobdell. The film stars Jessica Rothe, IsraelBroussard, Rachel Matthews and Ruby Modine. It's received mostlypositive reviews from critics, and it's a huge hit at the Box Office aswell. I absolutely loved it! Tree Gelbman (Rothe) is a very popular student at her school, who'shaving an affair with a married teacher and likes to party and drink alot. She wakes up in the dorm room of a much less popular student thanher, named Carter Davis (Broussard). Tree then rushes out of his room,embarrassed by what she's done, and goes about her day, which happensto be her birthday. Later that night she's murdered by a masked killer,and the next day she wakes up the previous morning, having to repeatthe same day again. Tree discovers that she'll have to keep doing this,until she can learn the identity of her killer and stop them.There's been so many movies now that take a different spin on the'GROUNDHOG DAY' storyline (like the equally excellent 'BEFORE I FALL',from earlier this year), that it seems like it should be it's own filmgenre by now!. This movie manages to do it in a pretty fresh andsomewhat creative way though, and it's a hell of a lot of fun.Especially if you love horror flicks (like I do). Rothe is great in thelead, and Lobdell seems to be an awesomely talented director at thisfilm genre. I can't wait to see what he does next, and I definitelyrecommend this movie as a Halloween treat!Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234
