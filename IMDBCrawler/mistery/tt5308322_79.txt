This movie has to be my favorite movie so far. The movie has a reallygreat meaning to it, it's just like Groundhog Day and Scream in onemovie. This movie is scary, I loved the feel of the sound effects andstuff. The jump scares were great. After the movie I went home and Icould not get to sleep, I actually woke up and thought it was the sameday.Overall the movie was the best movie I have ever seen yet.If I could only rate 11/10...........
