Went to movie theater with low expectations, but this movie surprisedme! I would not classify this movie as Horror/Mystery/Thriller, but as aComedy with horror elements - it was funny, i liked all characters andplot twists. I would definitely recommend watching it ? film was executed very welland kept me entertained the whole time!
