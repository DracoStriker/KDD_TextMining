" . . . it's not like I ordered a foot-long!" bulimic sorority snob"Tree" Disses "Tim" in the heart of Rump Country at the beginning ofHAPPY DEATH DAY. Set and filmed in Deepest Darkest DeplorableLouisiana, HAPPY DEATH DAY is Universal Studio's Latest Fright Festcarefully crafted to reveal the True Horror of White House Occupant #45(aka, Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad "The Mad Russian" Putin's lap dog, DonJuan Rump).

With Rump following Putin's Marching Orders toliterally slash funding for College, Dreamers, Poor People, At-RiskLGBT-Q Folks, and Food Safety Inspectors--to name just a few DisasterZones--it's fitting that Universal's Plot revolves around poisonedbakery goods and geriatric white male serial killers. Plus seeing GiantRump Heads (minus the wrinkles, of course) popping up all over acollege campus is the SECOND worst thing imaginable, only paling incomparison to having the Real Life Red Commie Traitor Rump leering atus from the White House!
