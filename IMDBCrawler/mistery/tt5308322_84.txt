There is nothing terribly new in 'Happy Death Day', but it is a fun,cheerful (!) movie that almost everyone will enjoy. I noted 'spoiler'in the caption out of an abundance of caution, but my 'spoiler' issimply to note that there is surprisingly little overt violence in themovie - the heroine always blacks out at the moment before her death. What does happen, however, is the GroundHog Day formula, which is notso much about the repetitive days, as the transformation of thecharacter - in this case, from a petulant, spoiled sorority girl into adecent, rather likable human being. She discovers her true love (theaudience likes him from scene one), sees through the vapidity of hersorority sisters, and re-establishes a connection with her widowerfather. Not bad.Add to that a few plot twists that are logical and not all thatpredictable, and you have a fun two hours in the theatre. Not all thatcommon these days.
