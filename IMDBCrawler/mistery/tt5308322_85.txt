omg.oh my gosh. I don't have a lot to talk about, but initially andalmost immediately scanning through the cast I was like, yeah I likethe brunette the best.as the main characters behaviors modified....Iwas like, aw man....this isn't even interesting...I saw that coffee cupover there in the corner...I had already seen Dunkirk andflatliners...and still...nothing. I think the funnest part of the filmwas evaluating who had on dentures or not. AND it seemed like therewere quite a few stars who had had them. obviously these party animalsenamel had been damaged and we were left as an audience to guess howthe happy ending might end up. don't get me wrong, there are sometwists within the film.incompetent hospital staff etcetera. jokes? nono..not many. babes? no no..and the brunette ? well, she seemed to beabout 150 pounds and maybe 5 ft 6inches tall....overall it kinda had aHEATHERS like vibe to it....but whether or not the boy the girlrepeatedly ends up starting her day over again with is actually thatone guy in Dunkirk remains to be investigated....youde have to look upthe cast of both films to see if they match up.
