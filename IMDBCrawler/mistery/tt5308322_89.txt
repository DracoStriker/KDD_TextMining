Happy Death Day, being of quite low budget, was the first movie I sawalone with my friends. It was really funny and had a mix of comedy,drama, and horror. The first death scene was the scariest and all thejump scares were expected but at the same time unexpected. It is a verythought out movie and cliché at times although the reveal of the killeris just mind blowing and twisted. There is not a minute in the moviewhere you don't rethink the killer is someone else.Jessica Rothe plays the character of Tree very well and you see hercharacter change personality throughout the film. The idea of taking ababy face (the mask for the killer) creates a suspenseful and creepyatmosphere.I think there should be a sequel to this movie as it would make akiller story line and tie in very well with this one. Great movie andwould definitely see it again.
