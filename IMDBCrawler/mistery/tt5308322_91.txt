I noticed a few of the reviews on here were posted without those usershaving actually watched the film.I was lucky enough to go to a preview of the film, and was notdisappointed. Starting off pretty slow with unlikeable characters, thefilm picked up in the best way possible. Throws a few curve balls atyou which is always fun. Acting was great across the board - lead didreally well in her role. While not the scariest movie, it's definitelyentertaining and will keep your adrenaline running.
