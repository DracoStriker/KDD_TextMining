The screenwriter who gave us "Sicario" and "Hell or High Water" hascome back with "Wind River" which he also directed and I am nowconvinced more than ever that Taylor Sheridan is one of the beststorytellers of our time. There's something about his thrillers thatare just so cunning and sharp and profound, like a great Americanclassic, even novelist Dennis Lehane probably couldn't come up withmaterials that are as skillfully played as this. And with "Wind River"Sheridan's personal artistry mission to do some effort to right thewrongs that the system has committed against the Native Americans,continues.The story is about a rookie FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) who teams upwith a tracker/hunter (Jeremy Renner) with a tragic past in order toinvestigate the murder of a local girl on a remote Native AmericanReservation.Sheridan has tackled themes surrounding the Native Americans before butwith this latest one, it's not so much that he's preaching about it buthe ties it into this entire fabric of community where you sense theclash between outsiders and locals, between whites and natives, sothere's a level of frustration about that arises from this murderinvestigation that brings up all kinds of cultural suspicions, on topof which there's also a game of jurisdictions. It's a complex yetcleverly woven thriller that starts out as a whodunit and evolves intoa thirst for retribution. And the fact that it's set in a very coldharsh environment just adds to the film's chilling effect.In many ways, Elizabeth Olsen performs here like Jodie Foster's ClariceStarling where at some points you kinda know that Olsen's character maybe out of her elements, but at the same time that factor actually givesher a good vantage point. Jeremy Renner plays his character like an oldtimer western hero who knows the ins and outs of everything, a man offew words but gets tough when needed. Their dynamic is not some kind ofodd couple cop duo, this is more like each of them trying to provethemselves while bringing justice to the family of the unfortunategirl. And the way Sheridan crafts the mystery from a small radius to amuch larger scheme is one that will have you hooked. "Wind River" ishighly suspenseful, it's a perfect thriller.-- Rama's Screen --
