There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murdermystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in frontof the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it(writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks oftop-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario andHell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with aheart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crimethriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allowsthe snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in aworld that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally.When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feelslike another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock isreplaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemndefeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBIagent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities ifshe's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner'slocal hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a pastfamily disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the formerhiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-cityattitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veterancharacter actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of howto deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy,well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspenseand mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; thefinale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictablebut extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning andprovocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River isan understated gem that deserves an audience.
