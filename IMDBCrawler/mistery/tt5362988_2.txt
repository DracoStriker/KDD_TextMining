I was lucky enough to see this at the Nantucket Film Festival back inJune and I thought it was excellent. And based on the response of thepeople around me in the packed theater, I wasn't the only one. Theapplause at the end was loud and long. The movie ended up coming insecond at the festival, right behind behind The Big Sick.I enjoyed it as much as, if not more than, Hell or High Water.Definitely more than Sicario.The scenery, the score, the dialogue and the acting were all on point.Some of Jeremy Renner's best work. He's been spending so much timeplaying spy and superhero lately that I think people tend to forgetthat he was nominated for Hurt Locker and The Town. His performancehere is even better.
