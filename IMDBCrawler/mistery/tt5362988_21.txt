This would be a very good straight-to-DVD movie.It's a moderate movie for the big screen.The biggest problem, for me anyway, was that it was packed full of bitsand pieces (tropes or clichés) from other similar movies and thatdistracted from the story-telling.The characters aren't well developed but the actors do an OK job withwhat they are handed.For some reason a story that starts off with suspense degenerates in toa bloody shootout (with lost of those tropes an d clichés) and thenleads to an ending which is a bit of a let down as nothing cleverhappens - at least not anything that hasn't been done time and timeagain.I also wondered why it kept snowing but then was clear and shiny when abody was to be inspected or staged action needed to take place.
