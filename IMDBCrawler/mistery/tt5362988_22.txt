It is so sad and disappointing and pathetic to read good reviews forthis movie. I guess that is a reflection of the world we live in thatintelligent people find this manipulative, derivative, exploitative,male macho, violent, ridiculous concept of justice to be a "goodmovie." I had to walk out of it because the filmmaker felt he had tomanipulate me by showing me the rape and torture of a woman. It was aflashback. We already knew it happened. It added nothing to the plot.It was only there to manipulate the emotions of the audience. What adisgusting world we live in to think that people are immune anddesensitized to such "revenge" logic. This was the worst movie I eversaw - tied with 1,000 other Hollywood movies that I call "RevengeMovies." Show a woman being tortured, raped, and murdered by someone-dimensional, ugly, evil men, and then the rest of the movieconsists of tracking down the men and killing them. That is whatHollywood passes off as entertaining. And, sadly, it works.
