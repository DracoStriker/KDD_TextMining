This movie was awful. Its plot is boring and clichéd and its charactersare paper thin and uninteresting. Elizabeth Olsen is terribly miscast.Her acting ranges from boring to cringe worthy and she ruins a lot ofthis film as she gets the most screen time. The movie sets up a mystery early on with some girl we don't know orcare about and the pay off after an hour of boring, drawn out nonsenseis that the whole thing (spoiler alert) was done by some guys who wereevil for no reason. They brutally murder their friend and rape hisgirlfriend for no reason at all, they just do it because they aremeanie heads. What a great screenplay!The movie sets up a mystery with the worst pay off I have ever seen. Ithas dull characters that are impossible to care about and a nonsensicalplot/story full of clichés and contrivances. What a nightmare.
