Half way throw watching this film my sister turned to me and said "Isit freezing in here or is it just the snow?". Now I, too was feelingchilly to the marrow of my bones but less to do with the snowy visualsand more to do with the relentlessly sombre atmosphere of the film. Iwould go as far as to say I left with frost bite of the soul. I haveheard it said from critics that the desolate portrayal of this storywas perhaps daring and effective but as an audience member I feltstretched to my limits without moments of relief. The beautiful wideshots of snowy Wyoming where reminding me that I'd rather be watchingan arctic episode of Planet Earth, at least our David Attenboroughactually enunciates. One big issue I found with this film was that Icouldn't understand what the characters where saying! The audio qualityjust wasn't sharp enough but even when I was understanding I found theconversations about grief too over-laboured. I think in order toestablish real poignancy in these more emotional scenes there needs tobe some light and shade in the films presentation. I think if the filmhad established some contrasting scenes with moments of comedy orwarmth then I would have felt more emotionally invested in the filmduring the tragic moments. I don't understand why the film waspresenting as a murder mystery because in reality the reveal at the endfelt like a presentation of the information we already new from thestart.
