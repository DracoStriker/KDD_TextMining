When actors decide they want to make the transition to the other sideof the camera and direct films, it can be a dicey proposition. It makesme even more nervous when said actor to director decides they don'thave the acting out of their system and want to keep acting, but with"Wind River," Taylor Sheridan (best known for "Sons of Anarchy," butalso the writer of both "Sicario" and "Hell or High Water" with thiscompleting his American Frontier Trilogy) separates himself in order tofocus on directing a wonderful based-on-a-true-story tale.Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a tracker who works for the Fish andGame Commission in Wyoming who gets caught up in the investigation ofthe murder of a young Native American woman on a local reservationduring a series of brutal snowstorms. He partners with FBI agent JaneBanner (Elizabeth Olsen) as they try to navigate the elements and eventhe law as it pertains to the reservation itself and a very thin lawenforcement department headed up by Gen (Graham Greene).I know there is not much to the above summary, but that is all youreally need to know about this film, besides the fact that I REALLYenjoyed it as one can do with the material involved. Make no mistake:this is a dark film that deals with very haunting subject matter, sothere is quite a bit of weight to it, but Sheridan treats this storywith the highest level of respect by allowing his very well writtenscript to drive it while still shooting it beautifully. To see suchbeautiful landscaping (actually shot in Utah) take my breath away whilestill understanding the danger of what the elements bring from thewildlife to the weather and even the inhabitants add a great layer tothe story, but what takes it to the next level is the score from NickCave and Warren Ellis (not THAT Warren Ellis) that frames each andevery scene perfectly without giving what is coming up ahead.From a performance standpoint, I really dug the way that both Rennerand Olsen dialed it WAY back within their characters with Rennerkeeping Lambert simple and focused on the task at hand and Olsenshowing how Banner is just trying to do the right thing whileattempting to understand the situation she in AND asserting theauthority she has representing the Bureau. Greene gives great balanceand levity to their dynamic while keeping his character involved as areminder of the heightened sensitivity of their situation.The Weinsteins' eye for film strikes again here, and I am also lookingforward to where Sheridan's career behind the camera goes as well. Forthis being the second time he has helmed a film, this is incrediblyimpressive and should at least be on your "need to check out" list ifnot all the way to "must see".
