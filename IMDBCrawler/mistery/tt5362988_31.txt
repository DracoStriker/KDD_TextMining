I was born in Siberia, was playing in -20 cold, running and stuff.Never ever heard of someone died from frozen lungs. People can freezeto death - sure. But freeze their lungs ?! WTF. And it wasn't even thatcold I assume if she could walk 6 miles in the night. And we see thatthere are snow ! A lot of snow. But track stay uncovered for eternity.I am sorry, that doesn't work this way with snow ! Also dialogues and some of acting were very very bad. That Indian wasliterally smiling talking about his dead daughter. So yeah. Movie was dumb and people like it ! Nothing new !
