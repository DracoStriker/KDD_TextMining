There aren't many films that I'd specifically recommend to watch, butthis is one of them.I didn't know anything about when I went to watch it. I'm glad Ididn't. It came as a fantastic surprise. It's bleak and eerie. It has a little "Insomnia" mixed in with some"Jodie Foster/Clarice Starling" thrown into the mix. It's a littledark, suspenseful and interesting right through the reveal at the end. The story, whilst nothing shocking in of itself, is realistic andbelievable. The reveal towards the end is satisfyingly on the money,and it tugs at the emotional strings to see very believable and wellacted grief on the part of the family that suffered the loss. Theacting was excellent and carried the drama very well. More crimethrillers should deliver like this did. Just watch it - you'll be glad you did.
