In some hot days, we need such cold movies to let us forget some of thetorment of the sun. The movie highlights the situation of people livingin such conditions like the difficulties of transportation, themarginalization of native Americans, and the issue of missing women inthat demographic.The rhythm of the movie is really slow, it starts with a scene ofrunning woman in the snow then everything will be explained in a goodsequence. The cast was really good specially the beautiful performance of "JeremyRenner", he fits really well in the role and you will see him in somedark dramatic scenes that he mastered.However, i have a problem with"Elizabeth Olsen's" baby face, she is a great actress but not for arole of FBI agent. The officer "Ben" and all other short period showingcharacters were good.The white costume of "Jeremy Renner" resembles a lot the costume insnow scene in "Inception" movie. Finally, it's a drama/crime movie that you will not be happy afterwatching it, it's really dark and cold, you can see that on the facesof the characters which i think they never smiled through the movie.
