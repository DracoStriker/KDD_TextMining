This is a mildly entertaining film, although pretty formula andpredictable: the revenge aspect; the hero divorced, alone and hauntedby the past; the young female agent who appears weak but actsheroically; the unlikely shootings. As someone who has spent a lifetimein law enforcement, I had to suspend belief but could not totally avoidthese rather obvious problems with the narrative: Why an FBI agent fromVegas, WY in Denver Field Div and there are agents in Wyoming. Was itjust to have someone without warm clothes? The very thin justificationfor lone SA being assigned completely collapses after she killssomeone, she would be writing reports and dozens of FBI SAs and bosseswould have been on scene. First shooting makes no sense and is notreally relevant to the plot. What oil company pays for an army ofguards to protect a remote drilling site? Actions of the suspects makesno sense, clean up scene and play dumb. Discovery of second bodyentirely too convenient. Efforts to portray film as addressing problemsof sexual assault are a bit transparent, writers felt the need toportray perpetrators as outsiders, hardly the most likely scenario.
