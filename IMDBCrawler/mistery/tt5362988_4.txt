"Wind River" is a gripping murder mystery-thriller written and directedby Taylor Sheridan (Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominee for "Hell orHigh Water") starring Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen and Graham Greene,featuring an unusually strong supporting cast that includes many fineNative American actors. Renner and Olsen play a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker and anFBI agent, respectively, attempting to solve the murder of a youngwoman whose body is discovered by Renner under mysterious circumstancesas he patrols the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming.The film scrupulously avoids clichés and is tightly edited with nary awasted moment, yet never feels rushed or artificial in performance orplot. Everyone and everything is there for a reason, and best of all,the audience is given credit for being able to keep up and connect thedots.The violence, which is absolutely necessary, is kept at a bare minimumas a narrative device, explaining and clarifying rather than assaultingthe senses.Every character, even the most heinous, is portrayed as a fullydeveloped human being rather than as stereotype. We learn how the Native American culture is victimized in a way thattakes us inside their world and their souls, but the journey isskillfully handled and never heavy handed.The photography is perfectly rendered, celebrating the icy Wyomingscenery in a muted style consistent with the mood of the story.Renner, Olsen and Greene are excellent and believable, but in no smallway this is an ensemble piece whose potency and effectiveness derivefrom the palpable passion and belief of everyone in front of and behindthe camera.This is an engrossing story well worth your time and money, and kudosto everyone involved for having faith that a discerning audience willfind and appreciate it.
