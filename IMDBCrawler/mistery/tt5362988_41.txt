Heard a lot of raves about this movie. Sorry to say, it was really badand emotionally manipulative. Even actors that normally give verystrong performances come off as extremely cliché and phony. By the timewe got to the final scene by the trailer, I was lost. This was justterrible movie-making, complete with an odd, dated soundtrack. Italmost felt like I was watching some religious video from the 90's.I do not recommend.
