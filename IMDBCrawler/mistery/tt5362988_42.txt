This movie is essentially about a group of creepy white guys who rape aNative American girl and then get mowed down by Jeremy Renner's rifle.He kills them all and that's great, but that's about all the movieoffers in terms of entertainment. The endless snow scenes are boring,the music is weird, the audio is bad, and Elizabeth Olsen is smokinhot, but an FBI agent? Me thinks not. Bikini babe? Oh yeah she knowsit! 1 star out of 10 and that's being generous.
