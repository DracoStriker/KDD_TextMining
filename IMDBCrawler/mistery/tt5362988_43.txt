After Sicario and Hell or High Water, Wind River comes in to finish itoff. It's a beautifully filmed thriller with plenty of reasons to watchit over and over again.There isn't much mystery to it but that does not matter because thismovie is about the hunt. There are really no clues as to who did thecrime in the movie and it all comes in one expositional dump. The movieis about finding the guy. Not figuring out who it is, I liked that.The actors all did wonderfully in their roles and I think I'll begiving Mr. Renner a lot more credit in the future. This guy isn'tHawkeye anymore. Everyone else did just as good and really made thedialogue between everyone believable. That doesn't happen often for me.When a movie makes me forget I'm watching a movie, it's a good one.8/10
