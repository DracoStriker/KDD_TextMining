To me, the movie Wind River, was NOT a thriller but more of a mystery.Lots of talking, more like a Drama. Was this movie trying to teachyoung women that you never go into a place where there are mostlyanimal-men present? I don't understand why these perverse men didn'ttake a cab or get a ride into the city with a bar to find women thatwould say "yes" instead of raping an innocent person. They could haveall chipped-in and paid someone to drive them and later, stay in ahotel. I watch this movie on Clearplay DVD player that cuts out thenudity and rape scene, so I don't have to see someone's junk. The bestpart of this movie, was the advice about coping with the pain of a loveone's death since my husband died August 2017 and some of us, aretaking it pretty hard. The movie was just okay but I wouldn't care towatch it again.
