Wow, just wow. This movie was heartbreaking.In the first minutes of the movie we see a young woman running andtrying to escape in the snow. She is clearly scared and is running awayfrom something or someone chasing her. Just after that we see a WildLife ranger who is portrayed by Jeremy Renner while he is hunting andkilling a wolf. Later he picks up his son from his ex wife's house andtravels to an Native American Reservation because he has to find a lionwho killed cattle on the land of his ex father in law. While lookingfor the lion he finds the body of the young woman from the beginning ofthe movie, and upon recognizing her, calls authorities with a heavyheart. After that the plot starts to thicken when a young andinexperienced FBI agent (portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to leadthe investigation I love movies which are "inspired by actual events".In the beginning I thought it was a little slow, and I couldn't focuson the plot, but when the story started to unravel I was amazed.For a long time I haven't sympathized with a character of any movie,but God, I felt so sorry for Natalie and her fate, and I was so proudof her, 6 miles running in the snow, with no shoes..Oh God I could cryright now. Such a strong character and beautifully written.The details around Natalies death and molestation that happened beforeit are gruesome. And the culprits deserved everything they got in theend. An eye for an eye.
