After seeing 'Wind River' I felt compelled to write a review since itwas a beautiful movie that tells a hauntingly sad story of an evensadder reality that befalls many Native women in the U.S. With great attention to detail and atmosphere this gripping story lineis told which is based on factual events and which reveals the untoldtruth of the disturbing disappearance of Native American women fromtheir reservation lands. Especially because so few people outside of the Native community knowabout this horrid reality I find this film to be of utmost importance.Nevertheless the acting, the dialogue and the directing are all ofsuperb quality which created a dramatic film of intense sincerity andthat is emotionally touching. Definitely highly recommended viewing even if you just want to see asuspenseful crime thriller, fortunately this film essentially offers acompelling insight into one of America's hidden tragedies.
