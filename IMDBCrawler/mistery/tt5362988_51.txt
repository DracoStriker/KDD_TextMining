Written & Directed by Taylor Sheridan, 'Wind River' is an absorbing &atmospheric Neo-Western Murder-Mystery Thriller Film, that works due toits strong making & solid performances. It may not be perfect, but itweighs higher on pluses way more than on minuses.'Wind River' Synopsis: A veteran tracker with the Fish and WildlifeService helps to investigate the murder of a young Native Americanwoman, and uses the case as a means of seeking redemption for anearlier act of irresponsibility which ended in tragedy.'Wind River' grippingly unfolds a brutal murder & how the people incharge get to the culprits. Cory Lambert, the protagonist (JeremyRenner) is a man who's dealing with his own demons & gets a shot atredemption when this brutal murder occurs. The lady in command, JaneBanner (Elizabeth Olsen) is a complete contrast to Cory, a rookie FBIspecial agent, who teams up with a man who's confronting way too manybattles to get into another. And its the diversity & the connection ofthese 2 characters that make 'Wind River' all the more interesting. AndTaylor Sheridan's Screenplay intelligently intertwines the extreme gapof its leading characters in a world of brutality & crime. The Writingbuilds up slowly, but never loses the momentum. What works more so forthe Writing is the consistently serious tone, that never changes gearfor the sake of cheap thrills.Sheridan's Direction, too, is competent. Ben Richardson'sCinematography stunningly captures the wilderness as well as thebrutality. Gary D. Roach's Editing is sharp. Art & Costume Design areauthentic. Action-Sequences are nicely choreographed, but are tooviolent. Performance-Wise: Renner & Olsen do some of their best work here.Renner, a splendid actor, portrays the guilt-sickened protagonist withgenuine heartache & also flexes machismo when required. Olsen isbeautifully restrained & proves her mettle as a performer. Others lendremarkable support.On the whole, 'Wind River' is moody, chilling & engrossing. Don't missthis one.
