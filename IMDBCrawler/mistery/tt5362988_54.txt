Definitely one of the best films this year so far. Wind River ispractically flawless and Taylor Sheridan is a name all film enthusiastsshould keep in mind for the future.The story is perfectly told from the first to the very last scene andshould not leave anyone cold. The theme of the film is tackled nicelyand contains elements of drama, crime, thriller, mystery and some briefmoments of bittersweet comedy one-liners which are all balanced reallywell. The performances from the entire cast are worthy of every praiseas well.One of the best features of Wind River is how realistic it all feels,from the story, locations to the characters and carries quite anemotional impact. Films like these are very rare these days, especiallyfilms that deal with the lives of Native Americans and are not in anyway morally biased.Taylor Sheridan previously wrote the screenplay for Sicario and Hell orHigh Water and if you liked those, then seeing this one is a must. Allin all it is a real pleasure to watch.
