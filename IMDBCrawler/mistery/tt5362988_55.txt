I really liked this movie. It was meaningful and moving. It was dark,gritty but still beautiful. It touches your heart strings. The actingwas spot on, really good performances. This movie is worth seeing,which isn't easy to find nowadays. Go watch this, you won't regret it.It did remind me a little bit of Fargo.
