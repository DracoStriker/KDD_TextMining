NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW! Honest opinionThis is the first time I've ever reviewed on IMDb, but this moviesrating is very in just. When the movie started, the first vibe went straight to Fargo, anothergreat movie. As it progresses, slowly steady you get as sense of what'sgoing on. The storytelling is solid, and the acting is only as good asthe script and the plot allows it to be, and if you have those in mindthe acting was on point. The reason for the title and this review isthat the plot is, and I have to emphasize it, VERY MEDIOCRE.I get the intentions of the movie, but I think for it to bear as littleplot, and as slow moving plot as it does, the characters need to bewritten stronger, which they were not. I especially felt that JeremyRenners character and backstory could have been more impact full if thescript had given Jeremy a chance to explore the character some more. Inever say this ever, but maybe if they had added 15minutes of run timefor character exploration, it might had been a 9/10 from me. I didn'tcome for action driven movie, I actually like character heavy movies,but the script was just very mediocre.Anyways, if you're into a slow moving, well directed, acted andperfectly scored movie you should go watch this movie.
