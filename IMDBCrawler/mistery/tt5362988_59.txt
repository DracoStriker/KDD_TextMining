I saw the trailer for this movie and thought it might be interesting(and frankly there was nothing else at the movies to see). The plot wasdifficult to figure out and the characters less compelling than I hadhoped. The acting, for what the material gave them, was good. JeremyRinner was okay as the sad hero figure, Graham Greene is always greatand Elizabeth Olsen as the out of place FBI agent was probably the mostwell-drawn character in the movie. I just didn't think it was enoughfor high cinema and for the reviews I had seen. The scenery was nice ifyou like a lot of snow and people flying around on snow mobiles. Iunderstood the larger point the movie was making but I think the seriesLongmire did it so much better.
