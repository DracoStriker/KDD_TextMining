WIND RIVER (2017) **** Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Graham Greene,Jon Bernthal, Julia Jones, Teo Briones, Kelsey Asbille, TantooCardinal, Gil Brimingham. Well-executed slow burner about a murder on aNative American reservation investigated by a rookie FBI agent (Olsen)and a game tracker (Renner in one of his best roles) who find there ismore than meets the eye. Filmmaker Taylor Sheridan (in his directorialdebut) delivers a taut, intriguing screenplay as the plot unravels withnoir precision and canny supporting roles including Greene as aworld-weary police chief and Bernthal as a worker whose introduction isshrewdly conceived. One of the year's best films worth seeking out.
