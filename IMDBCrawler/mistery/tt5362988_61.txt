Wind River almost suffocates under the weight of its self-importance -characters mumbling, most lines being a little over-cooked in theirmeaning, characters seeming a bit too contrived and self- conscious, acontext that keeps throwing its metaphor at you. But once you cut through all that, you'll find a very clichéd, oftensexist genre film complete with a moody, understated male hero, arookie female FBI agent who basically looks pretty and needs rescuing,a couple of action scenes that feel a bit like random missions fromGTAV (with plenty of characters that you have only just met gettingarbitrarily killed). The main flaw of the film for me is the presence of a flash-back whichultimately shouldn't be necessary, but seems completely relied upon foraudience satisfaction when it comes to a villain's denouement. Thevillains here have no depth or causality, they exist simply as villainsto further the story, but perhaps that's where the unfair treatment ofnative Americans comes in again. Its good - worth seeing even - but if you've seen The Grey (Neeson'scharacter specifically), Insomnia and The Valley of Elah, yourrecognition neurons will be fairly active.
