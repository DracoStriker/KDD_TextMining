Story had a good setup until it came to the rape scene which literallycaused me to leave the theater during an otherwise pretty good movie. Iam sick and tired of the graphic sexual violence depicted on film thesedays, and simply refuse to support it with my time and money. I ask allmy fellow intelligent movie buffs to do the same. This trend ofdepicting graphic rape in movies is disgusting, unnecessary, and addsnothing, only detracts from the quality of a film. This content isproduced only because the sick, misogynistic minds behind much ofHollywood's modern-day content believe that the majority of thepopulace enjoys seeing women violated just as much as they do. Pleasedo not support this kind of filth with your hard-earned dollars. WindRiver was an otherwise good thriller up until you see a beautiful youngwoman being beaten and gang-raped by a bunch of hooligans. No thankyou, this is not what I want to spend my time and money on.
