Directed deftly by Taylor Sheridan, "Wind River" is one of the bettermovies of 2017. It has a lean, stream-lined, story with great exteriorshots of winter in Wyoming and dreary gray settings along with theoppressive spirit of the "rez" . The crime and mystery portrayed athand are as provocative as the landscape. Sheridan has a good grasp ofwhat's important to drive the story. And as simple and impressive asthe story is wild, the acting and direction of all involved keeps thetone grounded. Jeremy Renner plays an anguished but stoic working man.Graham Greene brings a bit of humor and realism on occasion. The finaleof the movie amps it up a full degree with violent energy reminiscentto a western showdown.
