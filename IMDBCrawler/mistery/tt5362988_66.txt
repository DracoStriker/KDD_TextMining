I liked this movie. The guilty are guilty as hell and the not so guilty are holding upheavy emotional weight from circumstance .Its a cold film - there are a number of puzzle pieces left for the viewer to discuss:Levels of murder and sacrifice in a struggle between the thin emotionalcontainment and unleashed Rampage that defines individuals in momentsof crisis and belligerence.
