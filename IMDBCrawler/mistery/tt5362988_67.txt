The sparsely populated state of Wyoming is vast, and hidden away inthis wonderful state lies a Native American Reservation..., rookie FBIagent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is going to witness how rugged thisplace really is when she is sent to uncover the truth behind themysterious death of a young girl. "Wind River" is a powerfully evocative film that masterfully exploitsthe sense of isolation the characters have to endure each day, it'senough to send you mad, and maybe this has already happened to some ofits patrons. Elizabeth Olsen, still a young and novice actress plays her roleperfectly, utterly convincing in her quest to make people believe thather character is truly a rookie and that she is deeply out of hercomfort zone..., at certain points in the film, she even manages toupend her co-star, the older, more experienced Jeremy Renner, whohimself performs like a true master of the screen.Renner's character, the Wildlife Service Agent, Cory Lambert shows thathe isn't just another tough guy, that he in fact possesses emotions andisn't afraid to let those emotions show at certain times, adding agreat deal of depth to the character, fleshing him out and making himso much more believable and relatable.The supporting cast did a grand job, helping to prop the film up andgive that extra sense of realism, what I particularly liked was the useof genuine Native American actors playing the Native Americancharacters, Apesanahkwat (a bit of a mouthful yes) is a little knownactor more than likely held down by film studios for his ethnicity, buthere in "Wind River" he is given his big chance to shine and he doesmore than a reasonable job playing the Native American, Dan Crowheart.Visually the film is ace! Clever camera tricks bring about theaforementioned sense of isolation, you could really be anywhere in theworld, but alas you are only in Wyoming..., it took me a fair while toactually work out the location when watching the film ha. Overall the mystery, the main crooks of the film was A-grade stuff, itheld back and held back and continuously made you think, giving nothingaway other than what it wanted to give away, holding you in suspenseall the way to the end of the film, keeping you invested throughout,therefore achieving the main aim of any film..., getting you andkeeping you hooked. A highly intelligent film that all involved must have put a huge effortinto, proof that hard work does indeed pay off.
