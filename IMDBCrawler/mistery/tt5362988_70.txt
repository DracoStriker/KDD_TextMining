Wind River directed by Taylor Sheridan is another movie that remind ushow can isolation effect human being behavior and raise awareness aboutsexual assault on native American women.This easy easily one of thebest crime movie in 2017 thank to Taylor Sheridan good writing and aterrific cast.Jeremy Renner as the main character is very emotion andElizabeth Olsen as the "fish out of water" FBI agent also very great.Ihaven't watched The Snowman which has the same environment yet but ithink Wind River look better and you can see the proof on The SnowmanIMDb page
