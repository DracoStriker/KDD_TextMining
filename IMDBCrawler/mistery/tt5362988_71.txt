Jeremy Renner in this movie plays a role similar of Morgan Freeman inSe7en; both have a apathetic sense of understanding of what and wherethey inhabit that is unpleasant and undesirable.There are a few human interaction scenes throughout the movie with hischaracter that illustrate this with some excellent dialogue alongside aisolated snowy backdrop. The latter makes this feeling more apparentthanks to its striking cinematography and the movie rewards viewers tolook at the movie through this lense. The world-building and atmosphereare almost the main characters itself.I personally felt the actual crime and mystery was less than compellingand hits all the similar plot beats for its genre that you see in mostother movies.
