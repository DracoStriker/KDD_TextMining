This movie promised a lot. It had very good reviews and the trailer wasexciting with beautiful snowy landscapes and nature. But after a fewmoments I realized that it wasn't what I had expected. The crime storyis poorly developed where there is a clash of cultures who don'tunderstand each other and as usual under the lines the Indians are theloosing part because in contrast to the whites they are emotional,erratic, vicious and full of strange believes. And even though thereare a lot of potential criminals, the one that did it, you guessedright, it's the Indian! And women are portrayed also in a bad light,the female FBI investigator is naive, slow and clumsy, the two otherladies in the film are completely hopeless, both are self- destructiveand the third just disappears from the film in an apparent accidentalway. The hunter and hero of the film, kills wolves which obviously mustbe very old because instead of chasing wild animals as it's natural,they chase lams eating snow. And worst of all and this is the key andperhaps main theme of the whole film, our hero, this kind and warm man,when he catches the guilty murderer, instead of taking him to jail tobe judged, he lets him freeze to death in the ice and snow, speak ofpersonal vendetta!
