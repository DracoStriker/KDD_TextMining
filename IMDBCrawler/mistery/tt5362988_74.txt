Jeremy Renner delivers a fine performance and the state of Wyominglooks magnificent in this hackneyed disappointment of a murder mysterythat sulks from beginning to end. Sloppy and improbable it stumblesmore than once as it injects statement, upending a rhythm that is nearmoribund to begin with a cast of characters snowbound in blues.Corey Lambert (Renner) is Wyoming game warden trying to balance thepredator population in Wyoming when he comes across the body of 18 yearNatalie Hanson, dead from hypothermia but while running from somethingin the process. With the death occurring on tribal land FBI agent JaneBanner (Liz Olsen) is assigned to sought things out but makes a lessthan impressive debut that she more than makes up for with some deadlyshooting, take charge tough talk as well as withstand half a can ofmace sprayed in her face without mussing hair or make-up. Eventuallythey get around to dropping by the prime suspects place. At this pointthe already sputtering story stalls momentarily to play with time andtenderness and in doing so obliterate the meager tension remainingbefore resuming the earlier aborted climax killing carnage that auteurTaylor Sheridan interrupts to jam a strong woman statement in. It ringshollow (much of the blame belonging to the limited and miscast Olsen)and drains the outcome of impact to go along with a busy Lambert in thefilm's final minutes sun setting with three different characters. As the credits role Sheridan makes another pitch for the plight ofwomen on reservations but it does not assuage the fact Wind River is aclumsy, gratuitously violent piece of sadism made even more distastefulby a concern that is meant to purchase license for his slipshod mayhemand murky funk.
