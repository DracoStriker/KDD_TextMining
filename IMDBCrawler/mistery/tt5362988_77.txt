I'm not sure what movie anyone who gave this a review saw but itcouldn't have been this. I saw it in a crowded theater and everyone waslaughing and not from any humor. I have actually never seen such a badmovie. It was embarrassing to watch the actors perform in it. The plotsuch as it was had no surprises and th dialogue was worse .
