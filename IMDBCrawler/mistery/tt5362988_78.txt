I didn't like "Wind River." Its underlying philosophy is adoration ofstate violence. I saw aggressive enforcement ? knock down the doors with gun in hand -lead to a deadly shootout with an FBI agent. Turns out though that thedead guy had nothing to do with the crime under investigation. His onlyclear antisocial act was that he looked sleazy.Plus I saw an armed 'friend of the police' carry out his own violentdeath sentence on a suspect. The crime was nasty; but it's not a policeresponsibility to serve as judge and executioner.
