Although the film lacks any powerful twists and revelations, Wind Riverpasses with stellar direction that boasts a grim yet beautiful snowywilderness and chilling performances bound by a character-drivenscreenplay. It has a very palpable western film or Hell or High Watervibe, given it's written by the same filmmaker. Sadly, the overallmystery lacks any compelling twists or revelations. Veryrun-of-the-mill.
