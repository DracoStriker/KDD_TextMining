You can watch Conspiracy Of Silence 1991 on Youtube. Back to this film.The film is about a wildlife officer Corey Lambert(Jeremy Renner), whofinds the body of an 18-year-old woman on an American Indianreservation in snowy Wyoming. When the autopsy reveals that she wasraped, FBI agent Jane Banner(Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to investigate.Teaming up with Lambert as a guide, the duo soon find that their livesare in danger while trying to solve the mystery of the teen's death. Taylor Sheridan writes and directs this dark thriller which is supposedto be based on true events. Sheridan also screenplay of the DenisVilleneuve's directorial film Sicario (2015), in which Sheridan wasnominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best OriginalScreenplay. His direction of Wind River is excellent.I don't want to single out anyone - all of the cast put on a decentperformance. Elizabeth Olsen gives a very good acting performance -superior to that of veteran actor Jeremy Renner who I first saw inDahmer(2002). He acted superbly and I still remember how young helooked in that film, when comparing to this film.I have to mention Ben Richardson who manages to capture the beauty ofthe frozen landscape. Sound effects are well executed. This is one ofthe most violent films I have seen, so I would not recommend anyoneunder the age of eighteen to watch this film.You may also like these movies based on true story: Deranged(1974), TheDeliberate Stranger(1986), To Catch a Killer(1992), The Secret Life:Jeffrey Dahmer(1993).Fictional movies: Psycho(1960 directed by Alfred Hitchcock), Frenzy(1972 directed by Alfred Hitchcock), Seven(1995 film directed by DavidFincher), Copycat(1995 directed by John Amiel), Bone Daddy(1998directed by Mario Philip Azzopardi), The Bone Collector(1999 directedby Phillip Noyce), Resurrection(1999 directed by Russel Mulcahy).
