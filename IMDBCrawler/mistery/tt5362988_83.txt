Tough to watch and swallow, but movie had a great purpose. I don't likewasting time and energy on movies these days but I luckily ran intothis one after some research. Very painful to endure through in themovie theater since I tend to be very sensitive and emotional - I alsohave three girls. It was worth watching and it has deepened mygratefulness for my children. Humanity ca be pain and beautiful at thesame time. I hope the world is a better place after this film.
