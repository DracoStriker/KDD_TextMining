Taylor Sheridan direction and story is excellent Jeremy Renner is abrilliant actor but his skills are yet to be noticed by directors, Iwish Christopher Nolan ropes him in for his next flick.The scenariosand set up of the movie are a pleasure for eyes.the story is sothrilling that it is haunting me again and again. Overall a movie whichcan be watched again and again.
