Taylor Sheridan's achievement in this film lies in his success incrafting an old school crime drama that doesn't try to re-invent thewheel but instead relies on good old-fashioned storytelling. JeremyRenner and Elizabeth Olsen are both exceptional as a dissimilar pairwho out of sheer happenstance form an alliance to solve the mystery ofa young woman's brutal death on an Indian reservation. Renner is a U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service tracker. Olsen is an FBI agent sent on anassignment very much alone.The narrative remains low-key but gradually builds toward its grippingconclusion. We come to learn quite a lot about Renner's characterthrough his backstory. He's quite understated and effective in thisrole. Olsen enters the picture as an outsider to the bleak region ofdespair that the American wilderness is portrayed as here. She mustlearn quickly in order to do her job or leave a possible crimecompletely unsolved.Because this film deals with life on an Indian reservation, much of thesocial and economic woes might seem unfamiliar at first, but the filmdoes a good job of providing a snapshot of the hardship that pervadesin this part of the country and the difficulty that law enforcement hasin conducting even a workmanlike investigation. Sheridan depicts aworld that is sympathetic and troubled at the same time, masking itstears with courage and doggedness. Recommended to everyone.
