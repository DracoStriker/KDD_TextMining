A very touching beautiful story , I really felt sympathy with thevictim in the movie , I felt like I need to join them to get revengefor her and what have done her I really felt every scene which had somuch emotional drama , there are some silent scenes without too muchconversation but still touches your heart , makes you feel like thevictim was your sibling . All the actors were more than perfect all the cast even the policechief who didn't have so many scenes in the movie but his performancewas excellent and really felt so real All the places and the movie events were so real , the fact that theplace was very cold and far away from everything and that the policestation is small and have a few police force , the ambulance takes timeto reach , .. etc everything felt so real the environment was so beautiful with these snow covering every whereof the village with all these beautiful trees , I felt the beauty ofthe nature there that I wanted to go visit this place in real and dosome Skiing there everything about the movie was perfect including the final scene , theway they took revenge was really good and enough The music was perfect and makes you feel every minute of the movie andadded a lot to the enjoyment while watching the movieIt's a story that highlights the violence against women everywhere andhow people should react towards all those criminals who use their powerto rape or insult women any where These criminals everywhere should getalways the maximum punishment , should be an example to every one else eventually , if you're looking for good drama , good story full ofemotions definitely I encourage you to watch the movie I expect that this should be nominated for quite good number of awardsin this year Oscar
