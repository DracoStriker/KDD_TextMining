I Like this movie, it caught my attention and held it throughout. Oneor two scenes had me on the edge of my seat with tension.However, the stuff about peoples lungs freezing after a few minutes inthe cold are utter fantasy and I'm really not sure why this wasincluded, hypothermia is real, just as deadly and perfectly reasonablein this scenario.Peoples lungs freezing is not (really its not, I researched it)The ending, while good, has the most ridiculous premise that it ruinsan otherwise decent movie.I'm taking a point off for that but I still give it 7
