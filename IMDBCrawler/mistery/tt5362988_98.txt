Taylor Sheridan is an actor turned writer-director who last year putout the vastly overlooked Hell or High Water. It was my favorite filmof 2016. The script deserved best picture and best screenplay at theOscars. Wind River is not quite as good, but it is still an excellentmovie. Jeremy Renner plays a wildlife agent whose main job is to keepcoyotes from decimating herds of sheep. While on the prowl in search ofa marauding mountain lion, he comes upon a dead eighteen year-old girlfrom the town. She is face down in the snow with blood coming out ofher mouth. The FBI is summoned to the Wind River Indian Reservation tohelp the understaffed local police solve the crime. Elizabeth Olsen isthe agent and she joins Renner in the search for the killer. Along theway, they encounter drug addicts and other colorful but depressingpeople. Renner's ex-wife is Indian and they have a boy together. Itturns out that their high school aged daughter had a bad experiencewith a criminal element and this pretty much rounds out the story. Thescenery of Wyoming and Utah are spectacular and the script is precisewith some good, witty moments. So far for 2017, Get Out and Wind Riverare two best films.
