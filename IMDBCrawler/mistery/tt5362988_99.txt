I just finished watching this movie and it is a great little gem. Thecharacters are well developed and the backdrop is amazing. The hunterand the FBI agent forge together to catch a killer and in this casekillers. The storyline was believable as life in the snowcappedmountains of an Indian Reservation could lead to boredom, isolationtopped with alcohol, jealousy and the worse of a man's spirit. Beforethe big reveal I could see where it was heading but even that littlebit of predictability didn't subtract from the movie. I highlyrecommend Wind River.
