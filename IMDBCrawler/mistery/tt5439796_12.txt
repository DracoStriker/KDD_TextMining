Slooooow. I believe some of the tedium was intentional (i.e. these arementally dim characters so everything they say or do is slow), but thescenes felt heavy handed and went on too long in trying to make surethat everyone watching would understand what the scene was trying tosay. And there were far too many subplots that were either unnecessaryor didn't go anywhere. The actors did a great job with what they had towork with, there were many excellent performances, and the main plotwas clever, but the direction was poor. With a better director thismight have been a good movie.Finally, I think they owe the citizens of West Virginia an apology formaking every character a stereotypical "southern country folk". Allthat was missing was banjo and some moonshine.
