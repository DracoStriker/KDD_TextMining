While the characters did a good job with their roles, this movie isnowhere near anything like Oceans 11,12,13. The movie is way too long,drags like a ton of bricks, and is NOT smart by any stretch of theimagination. It is dumb, dumb, dumb. It is a heist movie with a everycoincidence happening at exactly the right time and laughable misses bythe guards and police. Seth Rogan was a waste. Hillary Swank issupposed to be a Joe Friday tough detective but is laughable with herartificial gruff voice. I think you get the picture.
