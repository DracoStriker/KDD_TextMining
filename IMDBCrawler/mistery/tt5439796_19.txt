239: Logan Lucky. I'm not entirely sure about this movie. This isdefinitely going for the out there farcical nature that Soderberghbrought to The Informant!. Each character is a little goofy in nature.They represent a different Southern archetype down on their luck. Itwas a little funny in some spots. Most of them were featured in thetrailers for this film. This is something that Steven Soderbergh coulddo in his sleep. It's a heist film where it seems like nothing can evergo right for this family. People look down on them and nothing seems toever go right for our protagonist Channing Tatum. There is a hint ofmelancholy to these people. While the movie wants you to laugh at them,they are really getting one over on you. It is a bit of misdirectionwhich is embedded in the DNA of a heist film. In the grand scheme ofthings, this movie is a fly by film. It's fine when you watch it. Youcan casually catch most of it and understand everything even if you'rebarely watching it. It's a heist movie and it follows that formula to atee with little to no variations. It's fine. I give this movie a C.
