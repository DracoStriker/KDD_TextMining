Logan Lucky (2017) This is a heist comedy film that follows the unluckyLogan family who plan to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway, and try toavoid getting caught by the FBI. The film features an ensemblecast consisting of Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Daniel Craig, SethMacFarlane, Katie Holmes, and Hilary Swank. The film received positivereviews, with many critics praising its production and the cast'sperformances. It grossed $44 million worldwide. I agree with some ofthe critics that the characters could have been fleshed out more. I wasconcerned towards the end of the film, but the twist was excellent. Allin all, this was a decent heist film.
