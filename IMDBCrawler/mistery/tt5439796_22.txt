This film tells the story of two brothers who attempt an impossibleheist. They steal money during a NASCAR race, with the help of a crew,including a person who is serving time in jail.The heist is so improbable, and almost fantastical, that I struggle tounderstand the plot. So a criminal escapes from jail in order to stealthat money, then goes back into jail unnoticed. I am already bewilderedby that, but what they do with the money is even more bewildering.It is a great cast, and I enjoyed watching Daniel Craig an ChanningTatum in the film. Yet, I could not get into the story because thereare just too many question marks for me.
