I didn't go into this movie with super high hopes but I at the veryleast expected some humor. Instead, I got the slowest, most boringmovie I have watched in a long time, perhaps ever. To make mattersworse, some of the accents were terrible. The acting was weak. I wouldhave expected better from A-list actors but unfortunately the actorsdon't always have control over what they do on screen. I'm sure a lotof it is due to poor directing. The heist really isn't exciting at all.It's as slow as the rest of the movie. I found myself just wanting themovie to be over. Honestly, I'm not sure why I finished it. This wasthe biggest waste of my time. Please don't bother wasting your timeeither.
