Logan LuckyMost criminals know that when you steal from NASCAR you are stealingfrom Jesus himself.However, someone failed to tell the morons in this comedy aboutNASCAR's number one fan.Recently laid off Logan (Channing Tatum) concocts a plan to rob hisformer employee: Charlotte Motor Speedway, by intercepting the moneycapsules that move through the facility via tubelines. With help from his brother Clyde (Adam Driver), two dimwitted hackers(Brian Gleeson, Jack Quaid) and a safecracker (Daniel Craig), Loganhopes that the caper will reunite him with his estranged daughter. Instead it sets off a wild chain of events.Despite its stacked cast and an accomplished director in StevenSoderbergh, this comedic heist is light on laughs and heavy on annoyingcharacters, highly improbable situations and monotonous pacing. Infact, Driver's dopey accent discredits the entire production. Worse, when you steal from NASCAR your punishment is to watch NASCAR. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca
