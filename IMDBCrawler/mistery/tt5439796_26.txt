Logan Lucky is the kind of movie which makes you enjoy the time youspent in front of the screen.The movie shows us heroes which would be considered as "rednecks", butdoesn't serve us the traditional patronizing "Hey see theses rednecks !They are so rude, so dumb ! It's fuuunny !". No, on the contrary thismovie shows us very likable and actually pretty shrewd people involvedin a funny adventure.If you have two hours to spend, enjoy this cheerful trip in WestVirginia !
