There are laughs to be had in Logan Lucky, but between those moments itis a bland and low-brow movie. A recently laid off construction worker and his brother attempt to pullan seemingly impossible heist and rob a NASCAR Race with the help of anexplosives mastermind and his no so-mastermind brothers. There is a Hollywood elitist attitude toward the 'red neck' states thatpermeates a great deal of the movie. The one development which isparticularly annoying is Tatum's daughter who is eager for him to seeher in one of those "little miss Carolina" contests. The movie wouldhave us take this for laughs, but in reality, this is a very degradingand depressing institution to put your child in.The best parts in the movie belong to Daniel Craig. Looking like a bullon the edge of going rampage, he doesn't look like he would have anybrains, until he gives a bewildering cue card lecture on how he made abomb out of candy. this is one of the two funniest scenes in the movieThe other involves a hostage taking situation in a prison where theprisoner make highly unreasonable demands in an attempt to distract thewarden.Soderberg's direction is fairly low key. He never builds a great dealof momentum toward the heist, and during those scenes he avoids anyopportunity to generate any apprehension. The whole thing goes soperfectly that it could only happen in a comedy.
