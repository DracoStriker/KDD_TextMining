If you are a fan of the iconic 2017 Texas based western "Hell or HighWater", then this West Virginia-based heist film is sure to please. In"Logan Lucky", Channing Tatum and Adam Driver play two distraught andestranged brothers who are down on their lucky and willing to riskeverything to rob a vault at a NASCAR racetrack during one of theirbusiest events. While the setting in this film is definitely new, the usual fare thatcome with bank heist films can be found throughout this film. But themovie is definitely worth watching as it is sure to deliver more than afew laughs. Despite the tense moments, there is plenty of humorsprinkled throughout the narrative. There are definitely moments to remember such as Daniel Craig, whoplays a convict that the two brothers go to for help with theirrobbery, raising his hat to the American national anthem before puttinghis hat back on and gleefully exclaiming in a thick country accent,"let's blow this thang". Then there is the part where Daniel Craig iswriting chemical formulas in chalk on the walls of the vault room. Heends up having to deploy his make shift explosion device twice becauseas he confesses, "I twisted the bag too many times". Perhaps thefunniest and darkest moments of comedy in the film happen when one ofthe brother's prosthetic arm gets sucked in by the vacuum which isbeing used to suck money from the NASCAR vault. While many heist films try to be gritty, Logan Lucky takes theheartfelt route ending on a positive note. Everybody gets a cut in theend. But the end is open-ended, and the audience is left wondering ifthe brothers get away or not. Either way, it's not the destination,it's the journey. In this case, Channing Tatum's and Adam Driver'sjourney is funny enough to warrant watching at least once.
