As my summary title says, "Complicated and too convenient". I wanted tolike this film but as you're watching it you're more complicated by theheist as it continues to move along. There are random characters orscenes put in that don't really have a purpose or just extra fat thatneeds to be trimmed. (Lady in the health care van??). And everythingworks out to the tee. Even when someone's on to them, everythingconveniently works out. And the explanation at the end. What?? Sorry,could have been great but script needed an editor. Good acting allaround. But, pointless, really.
