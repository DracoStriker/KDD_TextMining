The beginning of the movie creates the slapstick comedy feel I hadexpected from the trailers. Channing Tatum is absolutely perfect forhis role as the loving oaf, but Adam Driver steals most of the greatestscenes. The characters in essence are far funnier than most jokes inthe film. I initially thought Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) was predictable,but the writing for this character and his brothers is pure gold. Themovie isn't full of huge laughs, but I was smiling the whole waythrough.Beyond the comedic emphasis, there is the unexpected genius that is theheist. Just when you think this is another Steve Martin's Pink Pantherwith better jokes, The action begins. The twists and turns, make for anepic roller coaster that you never see coming. The heavy comedicemphasis in the advertising and the beginning of the movie play withyour expectations so you don't expect the uniquely, intelligent plotline to come.All in all, see this movie if you like great, stupid-funny writing andnear perfect line delivery, wrapped in a fun twist of complexity (or ifyou just love Adam Driver). Certainly not for everyone, as it gets slowin parts, but its well worth the wait through character development toget to the wild, heart-warming heist.
