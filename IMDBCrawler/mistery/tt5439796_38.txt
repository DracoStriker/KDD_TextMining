Most of the movie for me is 50/50. The performances are especially halfand half. Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Riley Keough, and especiallyDaniel Craig, gave great performances.Daniel Craig really does show hisrange as an actor in this movie. He's proves that he can be much morethan just James Bond.But then you also have Seth MacFarlane, KatieHolmes, and a surprise actor at the end who were all terrible.MacFarlane's voice faded in and out from being an Australian accent toStewie's voice from Family Guy. He doesn't have a ton to do in themovie, but he was pretty unbearable when he was on screen. I don'tthink I've ever liked Katie Holmes in a movie, and she was prettyatrocious in this. I'd say the entertainment value is also 50/50. Therewere parts of this movie, especially during the actual heist, where Iwas pretty engaged. I was locked in and entertained by what was goingon. But then there were parts where I really couldn't give less of ash*t about what was happening...
