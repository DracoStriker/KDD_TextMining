This film was better (and much different) than I expected. At first thepace seemed very slow and the story predictable and seen-it-before. Butthen the pace picked up and you really get into the characters (ofwhich every single one was cast and played their role perfectly) andthe story (which overall was very well written - especially theending). The ending had an obscure twist forming, but right at the veryend, it comes together for a grand finale! Very enjoyable and I'mdefinitely watching this one again. It's a 9/10 from me.
