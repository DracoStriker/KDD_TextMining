LOGAN LUCKY is a welcomed return for filmmaker Steven Soderbergh whogoes for smart and cool as oppose to dumb and goofy. This is no Ocean's7-11, this is American cinema at its finest. Don't believe your friendswho are most likely fans of lowbrow Hollywood schlock andcoincidentally loved Soderbergh's OCEAN'S ELEVEN series, Logan Lucky ishardcore Americana fun. The cast is fantastic but without standoutsbecause their performances were equally brilliant and thanks toflawless writing, it was integral to the film that they all play offeach other. The actors seemed to be acting in unison, much like theteam of unpolished bandits they were portraying in the film. WhileLogan Lucky scores some solid laughs, it is less a mainstreamcookie-cutter comedy caper and more a slick heist picture throwback.Everything about this movie works with the exception of the obviouslyforced casting of Seth MacFarlane and Hilary Swank, which was clearlydone to add a few more household names to the roster and get asses inthe seats. Fortunately Soderbergh uses these two hacks sparingly andreduced their roles to more-or-less cameos. In summation, see LoganLucky, it's just too damn good to pass up.
