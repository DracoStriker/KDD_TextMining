There's nothing funny going on. I love open or subtle humor but thishas nothing. Cant believe the performance by Daniel Craig in James Bondand now the work in this one was really kind of bad. There is nothingclever about the heist, they take time during a critical point for himto explain what he is doing and writing a formula on the wall. Withtiming being important in any such movie, these guys can waste moretime then waiting at the DMV. The prison scene also is unbelievable,people just carry things out without ever considering that they mighteven be compensated. No one gets screwed everyone is happy in lalaland. These actors who were good in other movies just cant pullanything off in this one. I guess you have to be from the areasmentioned to think this movie is any good.
