This movie was promoted as a comedy. It's not one. Frankly, it's notmuch of anything. I found it boring throughout, and odd. I didn't haveany sympathy for any of the characters, there were a couple of lameattempts to pull at the heartstrings that seemed out of place, and theexecution of the theft required so much coordination it was ridiculous.And what the heck was with the Hilary Swank character? Why do actressesthink having a low mono-tone voice is a characteristic of everysupposed 'tough gal?'In short, this film is neither funny or clever, there is virtually noaction, and you won't care a bit about what happens to any of thecharacters. Very disappointed.
