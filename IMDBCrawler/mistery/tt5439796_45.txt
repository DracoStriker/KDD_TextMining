On the surface, Logan Lucky has a heck of a lot going for it. It's gota zillion-dollar cast. Everyone loves a good "lovable outcasts pull offthe heist" tale. It tries to tap into the Appalachian quirkiness thatmade "Justified" such an institution. It's almost worth eight bucksjust to see if Daniel Craig can act all "muricann." And yes, ChanningTatum is actually pretty convincing as a hard-workin' country boy downon his luck. And there's plenty of John Denver references! But in the end, the movie goes nowhere, and in this summer of wretchedmovies, we're left with another stinker. Almost nothing is funny, andnothing is interesting. The movie goes way too long as they spend thelast half-hour "unraveling the mystery" while Hilary Swank glowersincessantly. And their attempts to capture some of that BoydCrowder-esque, crazy hillbilly lifestyle just fall flat every time.What's even more remarkable, is once again, the IMDb userreview/metacritic machine has awarded a ridiculously high rating to avery mediocre movie. I am getting tired of it, and am increasinglywondering why I'm wasting my money in the theater when I can be homestreaming Game of Thrones, or a zillion better movies than this one.4/10: Slow, confusing, unfunny, weak.
