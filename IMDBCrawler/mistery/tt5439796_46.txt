I walked out. This movie was completely uninteresting. I'm guessing themakers found it funny to have all of these stars speak in Southernaccents and act like rednecks...it wasn't. The dialogue wasuninteresting, and a huge disappointment overall. I guess becauseSodenbergh was returning from "retirement", the "Experts" gave thisfilm high marks, but time will show it was not. I'm also guessing thatsomeone finds a man with one arm amazingly funny...not.
