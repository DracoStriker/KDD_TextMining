This has kind of the same humor as Ocean 11 and the others have, it isa comedy, but seeing it right after a very bursting action comedy likeHit-man's bodyguard makes this seem a little dull actually. This is agreat film, we were greatly entertained, but I think this film wouldhave been better if we had seen it on it's own.Location, seating & time: Falkonér, København, Denmark - Bio 6, row 6seat 3 & 5 - 07.09.2017 at 21.10
