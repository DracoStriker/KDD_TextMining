There are many kinds of drinks. There are wines, whiskeys, cocktailsand beers. Each drink is enjoyed in a different mood. You don't drinksingle malt in shots like tequila. Same goes for movies. Some moviesare action-packed popcorn munching like a robust party with freeflowing beers and several loud friends. Some movies are like a mellowevening with a couple of friends, just sitting back and slowly enjoyinga fine whiskey.Logan Lucky falls in the latter category. The humor is layered. Thescript is smart. There are notes of comedy and notes of heist. Thefinish is satisfying.I chuckled and laughed periodically throughout the movie. It never getsdull. The acting is superb. No character is beyond believable and itseems quite natural.If you want to just sit back and enjoy a movie wash over you with afeel good factor then Logan Lucky is well worth the price of admission.Go see it!
