I saw this film at a drive-in, and it was the second film in the doublefeature I had gone to see. For the culturally deprived, drive-ins stillshow two features. Anyway, this film was a revelation. At first I hadexpected that the working-class characters would fall into theirdesignated stereotypes and we'd chug along to an easily-expectedfinish.Not so much.Actually, the characters were nicely filled out, there were stereotypesbut not the ones I expected, and the movie had some rather niceconvolutions to it and contrary to some other reviewers I found thelate-arriving Hillary Swank to be a really interesting addition to thecast - and a possible bell-weather to a sequel. Just sayin'. There wascomedy, drama, some real-world concerns and a lot more. Go see it. Thecast and script alone will make it worth your while.
