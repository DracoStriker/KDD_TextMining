Steven Soderbergh is no stranger to a crime caper having made theOcean's trilogy, a series of films so slick they'll have you thinkingit's the easiest thing ever to steal from a Las Vegas casino. With thetagline 'See how the other half steals', Logan Lucky feels like acompanion piece to Soderbergh's earlier works, though replace theslickness with slackness. The Logan brothers, Jimmy (Channing Tatum) and Clyde (Adam Driver),hatch a plan to pull of a heist during a NASCAR race in North Carolina.Needing to recruit help for the job, the brothers turn to notorioussafecracker Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) in their bid to steal a fortune.Soderbergh's Logan Lucky really did have a lot going for it; aninteresting setup, some far from average characters and a prettyimpressive ensemble cast being the key features that had meanticipating the film greatly. These were the things I ultimatelyending up liking the most about Logan Lucky however, the sluggish pacefeels as if it stops the film from being great.This is a quirky story about oddballs pulling off a daring heist butit's almost as if the film doesn't understand this, dragging out itsnarrative to the point where it all feels far too long. The charactersare interesting and their exchanges are mostly entertaining but thisfilm should have moved along much quicker than it did, the final twentyminutes almost reaching a state of stagnation.The father/daughter relationship that drives the narrative is one ofthe highlights of the film, culminating in a rather touching momentinvolving a beauty pageant and John Denver. It's a moment thatsurprised me, something I can't say about the moments of humour in thefilm, having had literally all of them shown in trailers for the film.It's a trend that just simply has to stop.Coming to the performances, Logan Lucky features an ensemble cast ofvarying experience but similar quality, from Riley Keough's white-trashMellie Logan through to Daniel Craig's Joe Bang, characters from otherends of the scale but both performed well. In fact, this is Craig asyou've never seen him before and he shows why he's so highly rated asan actor here.Logan Lucky is another Steven Soderbergh film performed with plenty ofcapability and kept entertaining enough through the characters andnarrative, even if it runs the risk of outstaying its welcome. I'dhappily watch Channing Tatum and Adam Driver star alongside each otheragain, so I suppose that's not a bad thing to come out of this film.
