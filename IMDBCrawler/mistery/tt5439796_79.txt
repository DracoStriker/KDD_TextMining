"Logan Lucky" has a smartly written script. The heist is carried out inan intelligent way with some clever technology. The movie deserves anomination for Oscar original screenplay.Thanks to the brilliant performance from the cast, especially DanielCraig and Adam Driver, the film achieves genuine comedy effect in thesense that it can really make the audience laugh a lot. As Jimmy's daughter sings "Country Road", I think of the years when Igrew up listening to the song. John Denver has truly influenced severalgenerations. Not coincidentally, the performance takes place in thestate of West Virginia.
