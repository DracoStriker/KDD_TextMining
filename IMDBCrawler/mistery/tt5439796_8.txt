I know I'm late to the party with this review. While it is still incinemas, I want to urge you to go and see it.Steven Soderbergh returns to the silver screen with Logan Lucky.Soderbergh previously brought us Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's Twelve andOcean's Thirteen. Next year he will produce Ocean's Eight. It iswithout doubt that Soderbergh knows how to film a crime caper filledwith complex plotting, serious human moments, dead-pan humour and asignificant twist at the end.The plot is straight-forward. Two brothers (played by a charmingChanning Tatum and a brilliantly dead-pan Adam Driver) attempt to pulloff a heist during a NASCAR race in North Carolina. Along the way theyenlist the help of an explosives expert, appropriately names Joe Bang(played by Daniel Craig, who clearly has been let loose and chews upthe scenery with gusto).Set in the heart of Trump-land (it is a thing you know) and close torecent racial protests in Charlottesville, this caper is Ocean's Elevenin a hillbilly world. Are there stereotypes? Yes. Are there southerntropes? Yes. Does it take itself seriously? No.The film is well put together based on the screenplay by Rebecca Blunt(As of July 2017, suspected to be a fictitious person; a pseudonym foran, as yet, unidentified person. The real person exchanged emailswith Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig, cast membersof Logan Lucky (2017), during filming. They believed she resided in theUK).To invoke a litotes, the film is not without it's faults but where itsucceeds is in the performances of this stellar cast. They clearly hadfun. The late introduction of Hillary Swank as an FBI agent assigned toinvestigate our villains/heroes is a masterpiece of casting and Swankmakes the most of her limited screen time.Too much analysis will spoil what is a thoroughly silly, yet enjoyablefilm. Enjoy!3.5 out of 5
