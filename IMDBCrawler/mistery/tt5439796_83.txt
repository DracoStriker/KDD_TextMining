LUCKY LOGAN (2017) ***1/2 Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Daniel Craig,Riley Keough, Katie Holmes, Seth MacFarlane, Farrah Mackenzie, DavidDenman, Charles Halford, Jack Quaid, Brian Gleeson, Hilary Swank. Fun,funny and frequently off-centered brilliant caper flick centered aroundtwo brothers (Tatum and Driver continuing to prove less-is-more intheir low-key turns) from West Virginia who concoct a scheme to rob theNASCAR racing event in North Carolina by enlisting incarceratedexplosives expert Craig (ditto) and a cast of unlikely cohortsincluding Keough as a sharper than she appears beautician and a nearlyunrecognizable MacFarlane as a foreign racer with ego to spare.Filmmaker Steven Soderbergh cooks the genre to a low-simmer with ashrewd and tautly amusing screenplay by Rebecca Blunt with some trulyunexpected moments of poignancy (adorable Mackenzie as Holmes & Tatum'sdaughter's rendition of John Denver's "Country Road (Take Me Home)"will have you well-up). One of the year's pleasant surprises.
