I was never looking forward to Logan Lucky nor am I really a fan ofdirector Soderbergh but I also did not have low expectations for themovie. I kind of went in expecting a decent time maybe giving the moviea 6 or 7. But I got more than I bargained for here thanks to threeawesome performances, a perfectly paced movie as well as a greatscript. Tatum, Driver, and Craig present three strong performances as southerncriminals with generally good intentions. I really enjoyed Driver's onearmed dim witted character Clyde Logan. Young Farrah Mackenzie coulddefinitely be a star in the making. However I did not enjoy SethMacFarlane as Max Chilblain one bit. In my opinion he flat sucked. The story is perfectly paced and really quite engrossing. Starting withthe character building, then into the heist plan, then the actualheist, and of course the aftermath. I was never checking my watch nordid my mind ever drift during the movie. I was actually really lovingthe ride and had one of the best times at the theater all year. I wentwith a rather large group of 7 or so friends and every once in whileI'd look over to see smiles plastered on there faces. I had a big grinthrough out this film myself. Logan Lucky does have some minor hiccups which include any sceneinvolving MacFarlane, the prison riot scenes, especially an unneededand silly 2 minutes Game of Thrones bit that felt forced and left mescratching my head. But overall Logan Lucky is a pretty great movie andgets an 8 from me.
