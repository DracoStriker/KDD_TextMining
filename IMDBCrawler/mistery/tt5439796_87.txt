Contrary to announced plans to quit making movies, director StevenSoderbergh is still here and producing one intelligent entertainmentafter another. This is his first attempt to cut studios out entirelyand get by on own means. The man's had enough of ?Ocean's" aftercompleting the trilogy but he likes an idea of a heist story. ?LoganLucky" is a working class version of this, which means less glamor andmore people wearing blue jeans and eating at diners. As expected formSoderbergh project, there's a bunch of pretty cool faces doing theirthang. Among others, we have Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Katie Holmes,Daniel Craig (yes, the 007 himself), Dwight Yoakam, Seth MacFarlane,Jack Quaid, and Hilary Swank. Soderbergh and the team are still verygood at putting movies together, everything in technical sense iscompetent. The result is too laid-back to become very gripping but itis certainly well oiled and tuned machine of a heist movie worth yourtime if you care about the subgenre. And there's enough little humorousdetails to smirk about, if you happen to notice them. Just likeSoderbergh prefers it. I still think it could've been shorter than 119minutes, especially because some important plot parts are explainedquickly rather than shown anyway. Also, there's no big amount ofsuspense or character development to justify this kind of duration. Butmaybe it's just me, dreaming of a perfect world where so many moviesdon't have to last two hours, so I have more time for other stuff too!PS The ony screen writing credit goes to Rebecca Blunt who is suspectedto be a pseudonym. Would be nice to know who's behind it. Maybe it'slike Roderick Jaynes for Coen movies. It wouldn't be the only nod toCoens in ?Logan Lucky".
