The Ocean's Seven eleven. Perfect concludes this movie in an attempt toconvey a comedic story of a couple of Southern redneck brothers and a'grand heist'. This film takes on many comedic tropes and stereotypicalcharacters mixed with awkward comedy completed with slightly over thetop performances. This is a fun, light hearted film, with not much depth but aninteresting premiss and relatively engaging hook and tension. AdamDriver as a one armed bartender and Daniel Craig as a Southern expertof explosives are just some of the funniest character tropes in thismovie. Indeed, Logan Lucky puts all these top actors as West Virginiansmaking it very amusing and fresh for audiences. Even though the absurdist humour incorporated is funny and well worththe laugh the slightly extended run time can lead to it being slightlydry at times, a major flaw of Logan Lucky. But, overall great laughsand a good time with an intriguing heist story.
