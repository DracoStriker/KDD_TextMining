Daniel Craig is an exceptional actor - that is the first thing thatsticks in your mind after seeing LOGAN LUCKY. There is no hint of JamesBond and Craig's Joe Bang is hilarious. Actually, the whole cast isexcellent in this film. The other night I watched A SHOT IN THE DARK(1963) and laughed out loud at the genius of the writers and theextraordinary talent of Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. Yes, inthe old film there are some bits that reference sex (a trip to a nudistcolony where everyone is strategically standing behind a tree orguitar), but the attempts (successful in the case of the 1963 film)were not simply based on the shock value of raunch and scatology thatis so common in films today. LOGAN LUCKY reveals a creative approach tohumor. I also appreciate that Soderbergh did not just default to thesame old tired Hollywood caricatures of southerners. As George Clooneyopined in O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU, regarding the qualities of capableleadership, these rednecks have "the capacity for abstract thought."This is not a sprint though. It is an evenly paced film and Soderberghrequires you to invest your attention into the film. The investmentpays off with a lot of laughs.
