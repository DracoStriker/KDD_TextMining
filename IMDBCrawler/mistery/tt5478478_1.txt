Post civil war frontier America and Christian Bale aka Captain JosephBlockeris is ordered by the Army to escort a Cheyenne Chief, who hasbeen granted safe passage back to his homeland in Montana, by thePresident of the United States, due to his terminal illness. Along theway the party encounter wild and dangerous Comanche "Indians". Themovie is intense and I surmise Bale will be nominated for an AcademyAward for this turn. Wes Studi, as always, as the ailing Chief, ismarvelous, understated and ever so powerful. Rosamund Pike is superb asa deranged widow who is collected up by Bale's party. Her presence inthe story seems like a distraction from the original mission or orders,but it's a movie and we have to have some man/woman tension andwhatever then derives from that, of course. The movie sometimes slowsdown a bit, and lingers, but it always recovers, and overall - see thismovie. And the music score is perfect.
