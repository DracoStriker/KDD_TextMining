Hostiles is a period piece that stars Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike andmany others. It centers around an Army captain who hates NativeAmericans that is asked to escort a Cheyenne chief and his family tothe reservation in Montana that they were previously from. The film starts off with a deeply disturbing scene where a family,including children, is massacred by Indians, which sets the tone for avery emotional, disturbing, and even sometimes uplifting journey thatquestions who the real hostiles are. The real highlight here is, of course, Christian Bale, who can convey aworld of emotion with just one expression. Bale is easily Oscar- worthyand should definitely get at least a nomination. Whenever Bale controlsthe scene it is riveting.Rosamund Pike also nails it as the lone survivor of the attackdescribed earlier. She exhibits grief better than even the mostexperienced of actors. Hostiles has a great message that is especially relevant in today'sdividing times. The film is about inclusion, and shows that we are allhuman no matter how evil one may seem. However, this movie is not without its flaws. It's very slow at times,and there are entire scenes that feel like they don't need to be in thefilm. Luckily, whenever the film starts to slow down, within the nextscene or so something happens that makes it more interesting. Hostiles is a heavily emotional experience that will make you thinkabout long after it is done. Despite the heavy subject matter, it hasan uplifting message, and pull some great performances from the mainactors.I give Hostiles an A-.
