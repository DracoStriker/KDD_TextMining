Daddy's Home was a bit of a damp squib, particularly after Will Ferrelland Mark Wahlberg shared such good chemistry in The Other Guys a fewyears before. That being said, the door was always left open for asequel, and with the likes of John Lithgow, Mel Gibson and John Cenajoining the cast, I was definitely expecting Daddy's Home 2 to be abetter comedy.Brad (Will Ferrell) and Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) have put theirdifferences aside however, their kids are fed up with the fact theyspend Christmas between two homes, a result of having a father andstepfather. Problems mount when both their fathers (John Lithgow andMel Gibson) invite themselves to spend the Christmas holiday with thefamily.Comedy sequels don't usually outdo their predecessor however, that ismost definitely the case with Daddy's Home 2, the main reason being theadditions to the cast who make this a much more enjoyable experience.It's by no means a great comedy but it did make me laugh a lot morethan the previous film.John Lithgow and Mel Gibson are two most welcome additions to the cast,giving off the complete opposite vibe from one another and the momentsthey share with their screen sons key to the film being moresuccessful. Thankfully the chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg hasimproved too, Ferrell in particular not being as irritating as before.John Cena, who's shown signs of potential comedy chops before, isunfortunately wasted as the rival to Dusty, which is disappointing asit would have been great to see Wahlberg and Cena go head-to-headproperly.Some of the jokes do fail to land, an ill-judged running joke ofGibson's grandfather being obsessed with getting his grandchildren topossess a firearm for hunting being the one that missed the mark by amile. There were some moments that had me laughing hard though, whichalways tends to happen when Ferrell is involved however, if you're nota fan of awkward family bonding with awful singing, this may not be thefilm for you. I quite liked it but it could be a major turn-off forsome viewers.All in all, Daddy's Home 2 is a harmless comedy that offers plenty offun and a dynamic between Ferrell, Wahlberg, Lithgow and Gibson that isreally hard to not find amusing. There's also a great cameo towards theend for anyone who's into that sort of thing.
