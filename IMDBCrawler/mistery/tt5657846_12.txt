This was a truly hilarious movie. Although it is something that is rareto say, but this sequel was better than the first movie. It was fun andheartwarming with comedic surprises. All the actors did a phenomenaljob with their roles. The movie was light-hearted fun, just like youwould expect from a good movie of this genre. Once again, I am remindedwhy comedy movies are the best (in my opinion).
