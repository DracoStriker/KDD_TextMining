I found this movie depressing, the fathers they added in the movie madeit so not funny. Mel Gibson's character was horrible. I sat therethinking how is this supposed to be funny. I was hoping that it wasgoing to play off from the end of the first one but no it went a darkdirection. Certainly wouldn't go to another one if they happen to makeone. I don't want to give away the story line so not mentioningspecific parts. But back to Mel's Character and the Christmas part ofthis movie who thought having a awful father was going to make for goodhumor?
