All these bad reviews are probably from grinches that have a gripe withthe actors. THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!!!! My family and I laughed theentire time. The different personalities of the characters were golden.I can watch this movie again and again. I highly recommend it. Mark,Mel, Will, Lithrow, John they make a great team. It's all fun andlaughs and add the wonderful spirit of Christmas. Just go watch it.Don't listen to the haters.
