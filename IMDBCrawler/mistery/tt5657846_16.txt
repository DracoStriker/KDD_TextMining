Daddy's Home 2 is silly and over-the-top, and much like the first filmisn't short of a few eye-rollers and missteps; there may not be adance- off, but they don't shy away from that level of comicality. Thissequel contains more slapstick humor, but in turn that also means morelaughs. It never got me rolling on the floor so to speak, and most ofthe comedy was provided through actions rather than words, but thatdoesn't mean I didn't have a good time smiling throughout either.The themes of relationship sabotage and reclamation continue here, withless satisfying results than its predecessor. I do kind of wish thatBrad and Dusty weren't too bothered with harboring internal conflictsas that is what the first film was all about, but it did connect to theoverall story so I understand its necessity. Character involvement isplenty spread out with highlights from Mel Gibson, though due to ashort run time there is a lot of underdevelopment juggling tencharacters. The absence of Hannibal Buress was also noted (and hey,where were the dogs?).As far as PG-13 pure comedies go this may near atop the 2017 list,though that's not saying much. Even if the film's quality might not beworth all of your hard-earned dollars, its value is still best servedas a theater viewing experience with the family (age not being afactor), especially as we near the holiday seasons.Minor note: There is a short after-credits scene that is not worth yourtime. I don't know what it was there for.
