I saw "Daddy's Home 2", starring Will Ferrell-The House, The OtherGuys; Mark Wahlberg-Patriots Day, The Other Guys; John Lithgow-TheAccountant, Dreamgirls and Mel Gibson-Machete Kills, Signs. This is asequel to the 2015 minor hit. Just like the first movie, it depends onhow much you like Will's brand of comedy. I am not a big fan of hisstyle-sometimes he is funny but most of the time, he is just tooslap-sticky for me. For instance, there is a scene with a snowblowergoing wild and sucking up Christmas decorations and Will is slammedagainst the house and drug to the top of the house and then falls tothe ground, just like in a cartoon. Anyway, Will & Mark are best budsnow, getting along fine and everything-they are even going to celebratetheir Christmas together in the same house, instead of going back andforth with the kids. That is when both of their fathers show up for theholidays-John is Will's and Mel is Mark's fathers-and everyone's egosstart clashing and pretty soon, Will and Mark are not best buds anymore. John Cena, who had a small cameo in the first movie, is in alittle bigger cameo here. He shows up near the end again but has alittle more screen time-he even gets to sing a song with Will, Mark andMel. As the end credits start, there is a scene with Mel and after theend of the credits, John has a scene-Lithgow not Cena. It's rated"PG-13" for suggestive material and language and has a running time of1 hour & 40 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if youare a fan of Wills', it would be a good rental.
