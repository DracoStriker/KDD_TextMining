This is a sequel with some slapstick comedy.The co-duds want to give their kids the perfect Christmas so theydecide to celebrate together in one household (hooray!). The surpriseis the grandfathers (Tough Mel Gibson & Sensitive John Lithgow) botharrive to join in the fun (hooray!). They all decide to go on a holidayto resolve the problem of whose house to have Christmas dinner at. The film had moments of humour and I found myself laughing here andthere, but I have an IQ of 30 and found it mainly boring. Be aware that most of the best jokes were shown in the trailers(booooo!) It's a Christmas nonsense film (that time of year).No out-takes! (Really?!)
