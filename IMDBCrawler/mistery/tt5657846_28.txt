I loved the first daddy's home. I thought it was a very funny andunderrated comedy. Both Farrell and Wahlberg we're great in my opinion.So I guess you can say I was pumped to see this film. When the reviewscame out for this movie, however, I was very heartbroken. Regardless, Istill wanted to check it out. And this is yet another example of why Ishouldn't listen to critics. This movie was so hilarious! At leastevery 10 minutes it made me laugh out loud! Even had me gut bustinglaughing out of my seat a couple times. Almost all jokes hit or atleast had me grinning. Of course, Farrell and Wahlberg are bothfantastic as Brad and Dusty. They play their characters so well andcouldn't imagine being played by anybody else. Let's talk about JohnLithlow and Mel Gibson. They were awesome as the grandparents! All 4 ofthose actors had great chemistry and that is my number one pro of thismovie! There are a couple of cons in this movie. Some of the jokes falland can be cringe worthy. And sometimes the editing and pacing can beoff. But other than that, I suggest you check it out. I guarantee youwill have such a fun time! Laughter is the best medicine! ?
