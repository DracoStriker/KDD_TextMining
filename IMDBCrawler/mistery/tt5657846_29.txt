Daddy's Home 2 starts off exactly where the last one left off. Thistime it's time to meet the fathers from each side of the family. Thefilm is exactly like the first one...everybody trying to outdo eachother and always proving to the other party how heir way of life sucksetc.John Lithgow plays Don (Brad's Father) and Mel Gibson plays Kurt(Dusty's Father). Lithgow and Mel are very funny in different ways.Lithgow is very in your face and gross kind of funny, where as Gibsonis more very dark and menacing and a tough guy kind of funny. As anexample taking the his grand kids hunting to not make them "pussies."The problem here is that the script doesn't allow Lithgow or Gibsonshine as much as they could. It all feels wasted in a way.All in all there are a lot of jokes that work and a lot that fail.Without spoiling too much there is one joke that involves the kidsdrinking alcohol and getting drunk. If we had similar jokes to thatthis film would have been comedy of the year, but oh well! It's aChristmas movie and it's always a fine message that it's always aboutthe family gathering! See it maybe cheap at the movie theater. 2.5/5stars. Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers.
