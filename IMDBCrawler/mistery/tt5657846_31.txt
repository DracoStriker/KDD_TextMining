We had some hope this movie would be OK, but alas, it was raunchy,vulgar, and even lewd. I saw very young children coming in to watchthis movie, being the 2nd one, I thought they probably knew what theywere bringing these little ones to see. It hurt my heart to see the lowand base behavior that was made to be funny.Now, if the children repeat these things, will the parents laugh? Howabout what the young boy did after kissing the young girl? Do it inschool and you will be tossed into a law suit.Weird behavior between father and son, not to mention odd language. MelGibson acted drunk, not that he was suppose to be. Always laughing andshowing bad adult behavior.This definitely was not a movie for children under the age of 12 or 14.There were really young ones there at 5-6 years old and it hurt myheart to know these children were exposed to this type of behavior andtheir parents approving of it by taking them to it.
