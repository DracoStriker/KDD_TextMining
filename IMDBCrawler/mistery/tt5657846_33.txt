"Daddy's Home 2 " is a nice, sweet, delightful, and effective fun film.The fresh cast includes mainly Mel Gibson (playing Mark "Dusty"Wahlberg's daddy), and John Lithgow (playing Will "Brad" Ferrell'sdad).Both elderly dads have a different approach to being a father andparenting. Mel Gibson represents the "macho-man" type of father whobelieves in making his children "super-rough-and-tough" ; on the otherhand, Lithgow follows an over-emotional father's role. Mel Gibson andJohn Lithgow's comic timing and screen presence is simply outstanding.Wahlberg and Ferrell have been made to ride in the backseat this time ;but that is fine, considering the fact that both were the"Super-Heroes" of the original Daddy's Home. This movie must be seen byevery current and potential father.
