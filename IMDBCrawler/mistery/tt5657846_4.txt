I laughed, I cried. You really kinda had to have the first one tofollow this one right away though. I don't want to spoil the funniestscenes or the moving ones so I'll be short. Will Ferrell is on top ofhis game, hammy yet funny and real at the same time. The real star ofthe movie is an old pro working it harder than anyone, and that's JohnLithgow. And John Cena has developed his comedy chops very well. Andyou'll never listen to a certain Christmas song the same way again.
