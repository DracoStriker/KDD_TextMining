A depressingly nihilistic film that would have at least beencommendable for its unabashed cruelty - that is, if an out-of-placeclichéd 'happy ending' hadn't been tacked on. As such, it only works asan exercise in awkward gags and uncomfortable dramatic beats, hammeringthe final nails into the coffin of three careers while it's at it. Now,if you're looking for a darkly comic view at a dysfunctional family,you'll find this for the first half of the film. If you want an upbeat,feel-good family comedy, keep your fingers in your ears and your eyes'wide shut' until the final twenty minutes. If you want a goodChristmas film, I suggest you go home and put The Polar Express back inthe DVD player.
