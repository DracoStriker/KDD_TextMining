This slow paced psychological thriller embodies everything that is keyto making the viewer feel a lively and frightening experience: it isbeautifully shot, with very talented actors, a soundtrack that willgive you chilling goosebumps, and an enigmatic plot. While some partsmight feel slow or superfluous, this is easily compensated by therising tension. Moreover, the fright is ingeniously generated throughthe actors' astute portrayal of character turmoil, and not cheaply madejump-scares or gratuitous violent scenes. In a way, The Killing of ASacred Deer reminds me of Cape Fear (1991). Great movie if you likebiting your knuckles in apprehension and get your nerves all twistedup, not so great if you are searching for fast-paced graphic experience(although the movie contains some instances of sexuality and gore).
