Neither. This is a Yorgos Lanthimos joint all the way. But it's aspowerful and piercingly original as a work of the aforementionedmasters.The premise isn't as intriguing or clever as The Lobster, but theexecution, oh boy... is even better. A horrific black comedy, anail-biting thriller, and a compelling moral tale all at once. Theentire cast is superb, but Barry Keoghan will be a star. Between thisand Dunkirk, it's his year.Go watch it on the big screen. Experience it, then see it again, andlet its brilliance wash over you. I don't say this often, but to me,this is an instant classic.
