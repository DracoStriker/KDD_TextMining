I love a good thriller. However I wouldn't go to see The Snowman one ofmy favourite detective psychological thrillers because of the way ithad been truncated. The Vue cinema in which I saw The Killing of aSacred Deer last night puts you in the mood to see such a film. It'slike being at the dentist for half an hour before the film starts.There is a crescendo of drill sounding vibrations advertising how luckyyou are to be in their cinema. Then after a final explosion of noisethe film starts. There is blackness around thirty seconds of silenceand we are taken into a heart operation. Having a by-pass operationmyself I found this interesting. Let me say that the acting was mostlyvery good especially that of Barry Keoghan. If you have masochisttrends I am sure you will like this film. If you don't give the filmaround 30 minutes before deciding if you are going to walk out. Let mesay that if you watch it to the end and afterwards you say you enjoyedit. May I suggest that you go and see a psychiatrist.
