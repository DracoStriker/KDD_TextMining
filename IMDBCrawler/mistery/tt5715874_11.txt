I went to see the movie because it stars Nicole Kidman. With her andColin Ferrell, how could anything go wrong? But it did. The flickseemed pointless - meandering without any direction or sense offinality. It seemed as if it was going one way and then stopped andwent a different direction. I saw a clip on an interview of Nocole andshe was asked what the scene was all about. She answered that shedidn't know. Now if she didn't know, then how is the audience to know?The only reason I gave this flick 3 stars was because the cast did thebest they could with it but otherwise I can't recommend anyone watchthe flick.
