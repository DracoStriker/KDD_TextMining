The movies of Yorgos Lanthimos are hard to compare or include in acategory. Maybe they should be declared a genre of their own. Dogtoothor The Lobster provided dystopian perspectives of family and love. With'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' it looks that he made steps ahead. Bothin assimilating and processing myths and social relations, but also increating a disturbing atmosphere. This is a disturbing film from manypoints of view. Because or despite of it it forwards a strong messagethat makes the film impossible to forget.The story starts as a medical drama. The successful surgeon dr. Murphy(Colin Farrell) has it all - a beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman), twomanageable kids, and some kind of a tutoring relation with anotherteenager of lower social condition which he may lead to becoming asurgeon as well. Yet, the apparent solid fabric of his life is slowlydeteriorating as the kid friend starts showing signs of becomingsomebody different, who shares dark secrets and has reasons to punishor even destroy his life. The film slowly slides into horror,fantastic, myth. It ends in a very different place from the one itstarted. It's shocking and frightening.The art of Yorgos Lanthimos combines the fluent story telling with themastering of the different genres, but his roots are deeper, as thehints to Greek mythology that is included in the title. He also makesno effort to avoid controversy of break taboos. It's not easy viewing,but it's impossible to get out of the mind if you immersed in hisworld. Strongly recommended.
