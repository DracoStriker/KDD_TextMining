The Killing of a Sacred Deer is this year's Birdman. If you have half abrain and any self-respect, then you won't bother taking in this dud ofa film. It's truly bad. I don't know where to start: the woodenperformances, the stilted dialogue, the poorly-developed characters andstoryline -- nothing is good about this movie. Even the stellar castcan't save it. Run, don't walk, away from The Killing of a Sacred Deer.
