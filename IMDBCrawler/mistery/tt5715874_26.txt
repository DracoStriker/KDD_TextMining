This is an interesting film, no doubt. It succeeds at building apsychologically oppressing atmosphere. Comparisons with Lanthimos'previous work, The Lobster, are unavoidable. The sense of absurdity,the tempo, the photography, the neurasthenic characters... In fact, adisappointing Farrell seems to be playing exactly the same guy.Personally, I had the same issue with both films. A promisingbeginning, but, after an hour or so, I just subtracted myself out ofthe action and started analysing the movie, way too much, more as acritic than as an spectator. And, for me, this is one of the worstthings that can happen at the cinema...If you are into this kind ofpsychological horror, I would rather recommend Miike's Audition (1999).That, for one, if you can stomach it, would capture your attention fromthe beginning to the end (and even beyond).
