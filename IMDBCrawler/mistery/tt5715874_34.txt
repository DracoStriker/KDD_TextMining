The Lobster definitely took my by surprise in 2015. Everything aboutthat film appealed to me. From Colin Farrell's dead delivery, to thecreative and completely absurd nature of storytelling. So when I heardabout  Yorgos Lanthimos making another film with Farrell involved, Iwas game. I went in completely blind; not knowing a single thing aboutthe film. While not as strong as the Lobster, the film is unique in itsown right and is one that still leaves an imprint.The film is about Steven Murphy (Farrell) a surgeon who seems to beinvolved with a boy named Martin. Their relationship is weird and wedon't really know what to think until we find out the vengeful reasonfor their acquaintance. Martin's father died on the operating table dueto Murphy's negligence and in return he must kill one member of hisfamily or face the consequence of the death of his wife and two kidsall together. His family go through three stages; paralysis in thelegs, extreme loss of appetite, and then bleeding from the eyes whichresults in death.As you can tell, the plot is fairly absurd, rivaling itself with thatof The Lobster. The dialogue delivery has that similar monotone,deadpan nature as that of The Lobster. The score is overbearing andjarring at times. The film is dark and yet gorgeously filmed. Thedialogue and a few of the characters are idiosyncratic and thus you canfind bits of humor in some of the situations. Lanthimos brings forth another wild, weird, and creative entity. Idon't think its as strong as The Lobster was but its still nice to seehow things unfold in The Killing of a Sacred Deer. The running time forthe film is quite long which stunts some of the plot development andpads but it doesn't detract too much from the film. 7/10
