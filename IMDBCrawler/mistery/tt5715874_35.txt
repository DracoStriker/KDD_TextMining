The Killing of a Sacred Deer starts off very slowly, very littlehappens in the first 40 minutes or so besides awkward interactionsbetween the characters. Even those interactions are lifeless and thecharacters are deadpan and unemotional, in the same style YorgosLanthimos used in "The Lobster." The only response the beginning of thefilm can draw from the audience is the discomfort that the charactersshould be feeling, but don't seem to be aware of.Then, there is a sudden stylistic change and the film suddenly becomesdark and twisted very unexpectedly. The film becomes true horrorwithout any of the classic buildup. There is not a single jumpscare ortraditional horror cliché, but it still managed to terrify me more thananything I have seen in a long time without ever raising my pulse.Nicole Kidman delivers a powerful performance while Barry Keoghanshines as a deeply disturbed and strangely powerful teenager. The filmwould have an even greater effect if the characters were actuallyrelatable, but instead they all exist in some sort of other dimensionwhere many people are deadpan and oddly direct. It also would havebenefited from a greater urgency to actually begin the story near thebeginning of the film, rather than 40 minutes in.
