I'm giving TKoaSD a higher rating than would be indicated by myenjoyment of it. You know when you realize that you are watching a welldone piece, but it just isn't your thing? The dialogue was stilted. Intentionally, of course. My best guess isthat it was supposed to give the character's voices a cadence that onewould use were they telling the story aloud. I don't know that to betrue, though.I do know that it kept taking me out of the moment. It reminded me ofdialogue from The Room by Tommy Wisseau, but delivered by top caliberactors. Once that mental image entered my brain, it wouldn't leave.Every line went through that filter thereafter.The story itself is ironically unique, as I believe it is an adaptationof a mythological story. It has that nonsensical cause and effect oneexpects from ancient fables.There were some moments I found enjoyable in their successful attemptto make the audience uncomfortable.Fantastic performances all around with a standout job by Barry Keoghan.Expect great things from this one.One last thing I will say for it. Even though I didn't particularlyenjoy it overall, it stuck with me. I did like that.
