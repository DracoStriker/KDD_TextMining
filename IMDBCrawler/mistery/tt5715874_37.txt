Tragedies are best played out in secret. The participants must beself-conscious to a fault, and the curse facilitator needs to have aninsatiable score to settle. A Cincinnati suburb is fashioned into aGreek amphitheater, and the gods of wine and harvest are the only oneswatching.This deadly production has a singular moral, but it is not being taughtto the audience. Steven, the star surgeon is the unfortunate recipientof this mythical lesson. With a wife retrofitted to his peculiar kinks,a son quick to adjust career paths, and a daughter who is an A+ experton the horrors he faces, Steven has yet to make a sacrifice worthy ofhis current comfort.Martin sticks like gum on Steven's sole. The boy's leverage is secretand potent, easily masked by tidy alibis and half truths. Steven passesprofessional blame onto anesthesiologists for malpractice fatalities.Step one is to properly administer sleep. The knife wielders rarely arethe killers. Martin wishes to change that.Steven has outstretched his wings, cradling Martin in nondescriptdiners and parking garages. When he gives the young man a watch thatdwarfs his own, Martin's attachment reaches the final phase. One lastpeace offering remains before a game of addition spirals intosubtraction. Survival will be reduced to haircuts and epic recitals. The suburbantheater bloats with situational irony, the plot engulfs sexuality andinnocence in the same gulp. The modern mansion shrinks to a livingroom, and the villain disappears into coffee mugs at an incompletebooth. The city with medical advances ten or more years beyond their sun-burst automobiles would suggest, has no answer for the scientificSteven. His careful domestic construction falls apart with about asmuch explanation as Bill Murray's temporal tornado. The killing cannotbe left up to chance no matter how much he spins around the goddess'command.
