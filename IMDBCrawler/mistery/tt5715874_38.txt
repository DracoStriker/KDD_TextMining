A mysterious drama, inspired by the myth of Iphigenia, as recounted byEuripides in "Iphigenia in Aulis". Directing is excellent, and so isthe cinematography. However, I thought the plot somewhat lacked (inquality and consistency), as did the relationship between Steven andhis son (in depth). Kaurismaki-esque poker face performances are atrademark of Lanthimos', and the actors did a good job expressing theappropriate vibes. The music and sound effects were spot-on at times,but mostly over-used and tiring.Overall, the director presents a thrilling, supernatural twist on theclassic euripidean tragedy, darkly comical and well-presented, that isa few flaws short of a great movie. An engaging and sensational watch,which has an unusual artistic delivery.For reference, some of my 7s: Man Bites Dog, The Butterfly Effect,Snowden
