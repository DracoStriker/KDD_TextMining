The Horror genre keeps on taking leaps forward in terms of creativity.The Killing of a Sacred Deer, along with It Comes at Night, are twoimpeccably original horror films that don't play out at all the way youexpect, and that's largely the reason why I love them both so much. I haven't seen Yorgos Lanthimos' other work, but what I have seen, is agood number of David Lynch's work. And The Killing of a Sacred Deersure feels a whole lot like one of his films. Aesthetically, tonally,and Lanthimos' direction all feel straight out of something David Lynchwould make. Interestingly enough, as memorable as this film is with itsterrifying plot, everything is often very quiet and soft spoken. It'salmost like the characters aren't surprised at the events that unfoldand that makes it all the more unsettling when horrifying things startto unravel.Contributing to that horror, is the films main antagonist, Martin,played by Barry Keoghan. He was good in Dunkirk over the summer, buthis performance as Martin is just about as close to perfection as youcan ask for due to how that character is written. I don't want to saytoo much about what he does, but it's some of the most unsettlingthings I have ever seen in a movie, period. It's these psychologicalthriller/horror films that scare me the most. Much of this film is left in ambiguity and up for interpretation, whichis part of the reason why I'm not revealing much of the plot at all asI just don't have the answers. But when a film captures the perfecttone and mood, especially in horror, the events tend to speak forthemselves and you don't need things to be explained to get what thedirector wanted you to feel.Overall, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is an extremely difficult film towatch, but not because of gore or violence, more because of the direevents that drive the plot forward. I don't think I'll ever watch thefilm a second time, but it sure was worth more than a glance.8.5/10
