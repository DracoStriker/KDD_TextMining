While I wasn't a huge fan of "The Lobster" after viewing it for thefirst time, it has been a film I gradually came to appreciate andadmire for its unique audacity. I was looking forward to YorgosLanthimos' new film ever since strong (albeit polarizing) reviewsstarted coming out of Sundance. While not perfect, "The Killing of aSacred Deer" is a well-made, twisted film that is audacious and oftenhard to categorize.It's not easy to give away the plot of this film without bordering onrevealing spoilers. As a result, all I will say is that it revolvesaround the life of a surgeon in Cincinnati who befriends a teenage boythat ends up placing a curse on his family--leading to horrificresults. The acting in the film is excellent, and Lanthimos' signatureblunt and emotionless style of writing is on full display here. Whilethe film's pacing could definitely have been improved (the main plotdevice is not introduced until halfway through,) Lanthimos still provesthat he knows his stuff as a skilled auteur. Dramatic irony forms thebackbone of the film's narrative technique, and it is effectivenesswithin the film's storytelling is utterly brilliant. Many will besurprised at the shocking ending, which is unlike anything else youhave seen in a movie lately (even if you've seen "mother!") It willfurther make the film a very polarizing one for audiences. At theshowing I attended this morning, I overheard two people say it was theworst movie they have ever seen while walking out. Make no mistake:this movie is definitely NOT for everyone. But for discerning audienceswho can appreciate the unique chills that Yorgos Lanthimos can senddown your spine through a pitch-black psychological horror/drama, thismovie will do the trick--and to them, I recommend this film. It'sintriguing and unique to see a film so polarizing and provocative everyonce in a while, after all. 7/10
