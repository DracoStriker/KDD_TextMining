Not one single deer gets killed in this film, let alone a sacred one.But by choosing this title Yorgos Lanthimos lets us know where he gotthe inspiration for this film: in Iphigenia, a character from the Greekmythology. After having seen the film, I took one of my old books fromhigh school (1978!) to find out what this myth is about exactly.Iphigenia's father, King Agamemnon, is ordered by the goddess Artemisto kill his daughter, in order to atone for his killing of a sacreddeer. When she hears what is going to happen, Iphigenia agrees to beingkilled, because this would be beneficial to the Greeks.In Lanthimos' version, Artemis takes the shape of a creepy teenager,who terrorizes a successful heart surgeon he considers responsible forhis fathers's death in the operating theatre. The surgeon and his wife(Colin Farell and Nicole Kidman) have to witness both their childrengetting paralyzed. This, announces the teenager, is the first stage ofa slow and painful death that can only be stopped when the surgeonkills a family member.'The killing of a sacred deer' is a horror thriller, not so muchdifferent from other movies in this genre. The otherwordliness thatmade his earlier movies 'The Lobster' and 'Dogtooth' so special, isless prominent is this film. There are still some familiar features,such as the strange, deadpan way of talking by many characters. But thesurgeon clearly has emotions and is increasingly desperate when herealizes that medical knowledge is useless in this case.'The killing of a sacred deer' is a decent thriller, with a nice weirdedge. But the typical Yorgos Lanthimos-style is less prominent, whichwas a disappointment to me.
