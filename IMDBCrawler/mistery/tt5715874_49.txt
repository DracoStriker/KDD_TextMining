Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film features much of the same daringly darkand dry dialogue that has essentially become both his and writingpartner Efthymis Filippou's signature style but isn't quite as removedfrom reality as his other work, especially the fantastic 'The Lobster'(2015), and as such is occasionally at odds with the way it is told(especially in the few jarring moments the crooked cadence completelyslips away and a more contemporary vernacular comes into play) only tothe point where some of the off-kilter ominousness is slightly lost orsometimes seems strangely undercut by the darkly comic moments thathere don't quite fit so well considering that they fade away almostentirely in the final act; still, it is perhaps this brazenly bizarretone that adds to the sense that something is simply not right straightfrom the operatic off and from the moment the piece hits you with itsstartlingly gruesome (and 100% real) opening image, you know thatyou're in for something both strange and sinister - a fact thatshouldn't be a surprise to anyone familiar with the director's previouswork - that actually transforms itself slowly from a mysterious darkcomedy to an even darker yet equally mystifying thriller that doesn'tgive you any easy answers or leave you with a satisfying conclusion -it's engaging and interesting stuff, though if I had one main complaintit would be that the piece felt long due to the fact that the secondhalf meandered enormously, but even this is thematically andnarratively appropriate in hindsight as both the film and itscharacters do whatever they can to prolong the inevitable. 7/10
