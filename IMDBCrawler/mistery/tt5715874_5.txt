The Killing of a Sacred Deer is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and madeby the studio A24... That should tell you all you need to know aboutthe movie. If it doesn't, I'll elaborate. Yorgos Lanthimos, director ofthe good but overrated The Lobster, has teamed up once again with ColinFarrell for this movie. And what a movie it is.First of all, the acting is great. Nicole Kidman and Barry Keoghan arevery good but the scene stealer is one of the best working actors today, Colin Farrell. He gives the same kind of emotionless / hilariousperformance as in The Lobster.Then, there's the story. TKOASD's story holds up really good, eventhough it's really metaphorical. The movie doesn't get lost in itsmetaphors, and stays on track all the way through even on surfacelevel. The story is extremely suspenseful, mysterious and well donewith good twists and turns, that really kept me guessing till the end.I love the movie's style. Its music, dark atmosphere and greatcamera-work all come together to make an excellent movie. The trackingshots are really great.What makes the movie most entertaining aside from the mystery, which isthe main aspect, is the way the characters act. Their conversations areemotionless, blunt, superficial and surprisingly hilarious. I foundmyself laughing many times at how absurd and hilarious what ColinFarrell was saying (with a straight face) was. Now, this is by no means a comedy. It's a suspenseful psychologicalthriller that sometimes has a comedic tone. As you can imagine, it'shard to juggle two tones that are so different, but I thought it wasextremely well done. It was only in one or two scenes that I felt, theswitch of tone was awkward, ninety percent of the time, it was doneperfectly with some great pacing. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a great psychological thriller Weshould encourage A24 for making original and unconventional film makinglike this.
