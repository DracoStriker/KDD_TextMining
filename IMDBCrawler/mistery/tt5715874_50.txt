The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Wow. I had high expectations for the filmwithout really knowing much of what it was about. It really didn'tdisappoint in any way. From the beginning, the film has an eerie,sinister vibe to it that never leaves and that is always haunting overthe film, even before certain plot developments are revealed. The filmalways keeps us at arm's length, where we see what the characters aredoing but never trust anything they're doing, anything they're saying,or really, anything happening on screen. As a pure mystery, they don'tget better than this. This is an outstanding directorial achievement.The entire cast is to be commended for playing these characters the waythey did, but it is absolutely Barry Keoghan who steals the film. Aperformance truly worthy of the same effect as even performances likeHeath Ledger's The Joker. He commands the screen and it's one of themost purely terrifying performances on screen this decade.
