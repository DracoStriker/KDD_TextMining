Ohhhhh my goodness. First off, we all know Yorgos Lanthimos likes totell stories of characters struggling within constraints. In "Alps",the constraints are imposed by a demanding leader of the company thatimpersonates the deceased to help the grieving. Strict regimen, strictrules. "Dogtooth" revolves around a North Korean-like isolationiststate where children have no contact with the outside world andtherefore come of age and meaning battling their own familiesconstraints. "The Lobster" mocks traditional marriage/relationships ashaving them be required by law in near future, thus single people areostracized to the outskirts or morphed into an animal of theirchoosing. Clearly we see a bit of Haneke nihilism and abandonment oftraditional the loving family ideal/trope. "The Killing of a Sacred Deer", Lanthimos' best to date in my opinion,revolves around constraints arbitrarily imposed by a creepy mysteriouscharacter about midway through the film. Without giving much away, theprotagonist has an agonizing internal dialogue set forth due to rulesof the game like the "Saw" films. Family is pit against each other, andeach character uniquely focuses solely on their own survival. Thecinematography itself resembles "The Shining", and added to the Kubricksimilarities are the strong orchestral score that permeates the filmfrom even the "lighter" earlier scenes--perhapsforeshadowing----definitely foreshadowing. Bravo Yorgos
