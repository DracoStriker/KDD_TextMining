Critic pet directors come in all styles and places. One of the biggestcurrent ones is Greek art-house filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos. Aftergarnering a Foreign Film Oscar nomination for his offbeat DOGTOOTH,Lanthimos made an even bigger splash with his first English-languagefilm, THE LOBSTER(another Oscar nod; Screenplay). Now, despite beingbooed at Cannes, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER is getting mostlypositive reviews. What his supporters applaud is his "originality" and"unique vision". But, when a film like SACRED DEER comes along that isunrelentingly dire, being "unique" carries one only so far.As for it's "originality", SACRED DEER's plot about the sins of onefamily member being payed for by the entire family is as old as...well,in this case, 400 B.C. (Iphigenia in Aulis by Euripides)! The pictureis finely photographed (in 35mm) by Thimios Bakatkis with some superbcompositions. Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell do what they can with thematerial, as do the three younger co-stars. Some of the music choicesare effective on their own (it's a compilation score).All of this makes it all the most disappointing that Lanthimos andEfthymis Filippou's screenplay is so relentlessly aimless. The clippeddialogue, bizarre allusions and grotesque behavior may have workedwithin the context of an off-kilter film such as THE LOBSTER (eventhere, the movie ran out of ideas long before the finish line), but, inSACRED DEER it becomes a dirge.I understand the pull of seeing something different for critics who seea lot of movies. I value that as well. But, call me a philistine, but,I will take a modestly made movie with competent performances and acogent script over the "original" and "unique vision" of a SACRED DEER.
