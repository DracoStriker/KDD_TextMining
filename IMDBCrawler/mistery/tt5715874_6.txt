While the performances of the actors were really good and the wholedesign of the picture went well for me, I saw a big hole int he plot Ican not ignore.Colin Farrell plays a heart surgery (cool opening scene of hischaracter doing open heart surgery) whose being black mailed by a kidwhose dad died on his operating table. How this kid was able to holdsuch a huge price that he felt was owed cause of his father's death Inever fully understood.Feel the movie thought too much of itself. Looks like the director whoalso director the Lobster with Colin Farrell got too big for hisbridges.
