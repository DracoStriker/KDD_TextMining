The worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. Saveyour money and don't waste your time on this one. They tried to make afilm noir, but all they made was a film de merde! It was slow movingand pretentious and the only reason I stuck it out was because i spentso much to see it at the cinema, waiting and hoping for it to getbetter, but it never happened. I would have given it a 0 if possible,but the lowest score allowed is a 1, so it gets a 1. Slow, boring andterrible sums it up! Don't waste your money or time.
