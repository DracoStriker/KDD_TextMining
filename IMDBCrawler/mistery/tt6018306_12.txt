As a Vietnam era Marine, I feel this movie took too many liberties andconsequently showed a total disrespect for the Marine Corp for thefollowing reason.When a Marine Veteran wears a Marine uniform, he is to wear it as if onactive duty. This means no beards. One or two the the main charactershad beards while wearing Class A & B uniforms. This is totallydisrespectful of the Corp and the uniform.But given Hollywood's track record, this should not come as a surpriseto any of us. Thank God I did not spend my money to watch this movie.The movie's trailer said enough.
