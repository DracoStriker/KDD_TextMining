Last Flag Flying. There's no denying, Director Richard Linklater("Boyhood," "Before Midnight") knows his way around relationship films.Here, the reserved Doc Shephard (Steve Carell) reunites with his formermarine buddies "the no holds bar" Sal (Bryan Cranston) and now man ofthe cloth Rev. Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) to identify and bury Doc'sdeceased son. With an unspoken history between the men, the reunion andjourney is continually filled with tension. When by-the- book ColonelWilits (Yul Vazquez "Captain Phillips") tries to stand in the way ofthe guys mission, especially after truths are told, comrade in arms andbest friend to the deceased Washington (J. Quinton Johnson - currentlyon Broadway "Hamilton") join the men as they prove once again,friendships built in tough times are the strongest when times aretough. Based a novel by Darrl Ponicsan, Linklater and him have adapteda touching and honest film that equally pulls at your heart strings andmakes you laugh. All the key players here are at the top of the actinggame and should be recognized for their contributions. What Iespecially liked about this film was that the history between the menand the story behind the death were all told without flashbacks. And,when the terrific Cicely Tyson appeared on screen, one could feel theaudiences appreciation for her years of screen presences. To date, thisis the best all around film I've seen, and you shouldn't miss it.
