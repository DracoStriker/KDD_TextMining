This was an enjoyable movie. I think it was deep when it needed to beand light when it needed it. I laughed and I would almost came to tears(and I don't normally do that). I followed the story line and it waseventful. I will say it felt like a long time to finally get to theburial but it was a fun adventure. Breaking Bad star was amazing andfunny. Lawrence did a great job playing his part. And Steve didamazing. Great display of emotions and carried his part nicely. Goodmovie to watch. I was not in the military so I am not as sensitive tohow the marines were portrayed in this movie but I know that they makea huge sacrifice for serving for our country and I have nothing butrespect for all military branches. I felt good after leaving this movieand you will too.
