I know this won't win an academy award but not because of the acting orthe plot of the movie. This was an excellent movie, it was sad in partsand very funny in others. Great acting by everyone. My boyfriend and Iwent, he is a Vietnam Vet and the theater was full of people our agebut no younger people. Very sad.
