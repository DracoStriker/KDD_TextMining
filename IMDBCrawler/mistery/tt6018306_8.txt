Average soapy melodrama of three Veterans reuniting 30 years later islifted by "Rick" Linklater and Darryl Ponicsan's writing and greatperformances by Bryan Cranston as a bar owner and Laurence Fishburne asa minister, more than main character Steve Carell.Three former Vietnam servicemen meet 30 years later in 2003 when one oftheir sons is killed serving in Iraq. The three travel to Arlington andDelaware to see the body, destined for Boston. Carell's son, he istold, "died with honor serving his country."As he mourns, his two friends learn what really happened from thesoldier's best friend, a young marine escorting the body. He didn't diein battle. He was shot at a public market by a local when they went tobuy soft drinks during their mission moving supplies for Iraqi schools.After he demands to see his deceased son, he is so emotionally affectedthat the three decide to bring the body back home themselves, ratherthan let the military hold a funeral and burial.This provides some mediocre humor in a few scenes with devious Cranstonbeing the wild card, taking over the transportation, buying his friendstheir first cell phones and the three being chased by HomelandSecurity.The story inspires us with the camaraderie of these three marines whosurvived to reminisce of their other close friend who did not. It showsthe secrets of war and how our fallen heroes may have died throughdifferent circumstances than their families were told.Such as their own friend killed in Vietnam while the other three werebeing irresponsible and not protecting each other. They visit hismother who thinks her son died saving them. As they sit on her couchthey hide the truth. Should they reveal that her son's death may havebeen partly their fault or let her continue to believe what thegovernment told her 30 years ago?
