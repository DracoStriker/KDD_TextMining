This was unquestionably the absolute worst movie I have ever spent myheard earned money on, and I have never wished for a refund so much inall my movie-going years. While I wanted to walk out after the first 15minutes, I instead chose to continue to wait, thinking that at somepoint soon the movie would get better and be worthy of some words ofpraise or at least one commendation. However, by mid- movie it wasclear that this movie was only spiraling from bad to worse, and I wouldhave walked out had I not been accompanied by the friend who chose forus to see it. It was ridiculous from start to finish, and not the leastbit funny. I was just beyond embarrassed for these otherwise noteworthyactors. Truly, it was so awful that I kept waiting for the movietheater people to jump out from behind the screen and say "Gotcha," andthen start the real movie, but sadly, it was not to be. SPOILER: The only redeeming moments in the movie were toward the endwhen the father explains the psychological forces driving the mother'scontrolling behavior and the touching apologies that ensued betweenmother and daughter in the church. The only funny line was at the endwith Baranski calling the boyfriend Jesus. Do not waste your money onthis disgusting movie from it's scripted, blasphemous lines out of themouth of a sweet young child (OMFG) to the truly vile salon male waxingscene, to the raunchy dance at the end that no child should ever bemade to sit through. Just. Plain. Awful.
