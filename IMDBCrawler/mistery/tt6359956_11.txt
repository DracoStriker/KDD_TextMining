BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD TEAR THIS APART! I went to see this yesterday forsome Christmas cheer and I got this piece of crap excuse for a holidaymovie. This film was written by the two men behind The Hangover series.It revolves around Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn and thearrival of their mothers Susan Sarandon, Cheryl Hines and ChristineBaranski. ALL ACTRESS WHOM I ADORE! But the script was just stupidstupid stupid. NOT funny and the characters downright unlikable. Iabsolutely love the actress Kathryn Hahn but having her and her mom(Susan Sarandon) out in front of a store with a basket that says"Canned goods donations" where they proceed to aggressively STEALGROCERIES from the bags of people who exit the store, open a bottle ofwine and drink it in the parking lot makes them not only UNLIKEABLE butnot funny and pathetic. Why in the HELL would I root for thesecharacters? And when Mila Kunis' character tears down the X-mas tree her mother putup with "ornaments from the Titanic" and destroys everything her motherdid? The only thing I was thinking was "Wow what an A**hole". HATEDTHIS MOVIE and I'm sure the actresses who probably just needed apaycheck did too.3 stars for the cast and the pretty set decorations.
