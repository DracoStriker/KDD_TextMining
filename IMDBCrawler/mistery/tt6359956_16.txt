1- The trailer sums up all the funny bits in the movie, rest is epiccrap 2- Horrendous acting 3- Brain numbing dialogue 4- Outlandish (likecrazy ass outlandish not inspiring outlandish) incidents 5- Stuck upits own ass writing 6- A diarrhoea of events with no specific relationor logic OK if that's too general for you, Carla (a very mediocre- lookingmiddle aged woman with no education, career, wits, or any prospects ofany nature) falls in love at first sight while staring at the massivepenis of her fire-fighter stripper handsome heart-of-gold hunk who hasa six pack, and obviously some sort or testicular condition because hedoes not flinch or even grimace as she waxed his balls. And he lovesher back at first sight too because she "treated him like a human beingnot just a penis" (she didn't). Oh zo zweet! Does this part of thestory go anywhere? No, why would it if the entire movie isn't goinganywhere with any sort of story at all? If you're OK with this kind ofbullshit, go watch it. Every ten minutes, I wanted to shout "come on!" Stupid women, sillywomen, thirsty women, desperate women, crazy women. Chauvinism has nobounds! I must add that I didn't pay to see this movie. I have an Odeon Card. Iwas one of three people in the cinema on a Friday night and one of themfell asleep mid- way. Enough said.
