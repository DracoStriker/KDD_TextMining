If you've seen 2016's "Bad Moms", then you'll know what sort of humorto expect in "A Bad Moms Christmas". The protagonists (Mila Kunis,Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn) from the original are at wit's end fromhaving to make Christmas perfect...and then their moms show up. One's(Christine Baranski) a perfectionist, one's (Cheryl Hines) clingy, andone's (Susan Sarandon) a stoner. Sure enough, the personalities startclashing.Much like how the original looked at the excessive tendency to organizeour lives in the 21st century, this one looks at the stress thatdominates our lives during the holidays. It's easy to understand whyAmy, Kiki and Carla do what they do in the mall (Carla's crassnessabets it, of course). And the moms have their own issues to deal with.Obviously, it's not any sort of high-brow cinema, but it's not supposedto be. The point is to be raunchy, and the waxing scene makes clearthat the movie's not going to resist doing whatever it wants.Baranski's character is basically her role as Leonard's mom on "The BigBang Theory" (her no-nonsense physiognomy makes her perfect for theseroles).Basically, it's a fun movie. Keep an open mind and you'll enjoy it.
