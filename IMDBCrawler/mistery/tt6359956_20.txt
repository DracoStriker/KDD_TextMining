Aside from the gross profanity and coarseness, vulgarity, obscenity,impropriety, etc., it leaves no message, no moral, no lesson, theacting was bad, the plot was bad, and to top it off, it wasn't evenfunny. The girl who uses God's name in vain just goes to show thatanyone is willing to let their kid take an acting role even if thatmeans he has to blaspheme and use God's name with utter disrespect.This is by far the worst movie I have ever gone to. I would give itzero stars if it allowed me to.
