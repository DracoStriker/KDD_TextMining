If you really enjoyed the original Bad Moms it should be no surprisethat this one was not as good. With most comedy sequels we tend towatch them because we really liked the characters not because there'sany type of story that needs to be continued. I mean if you look at TheHangover movies more than one wasn't really necessary but thecharacters were so likable they knew they could continue with them. BadMoms is pretty much the same. I felt the characters were just aslikable this time around though not as naturally funny. At times thecomedy was forced and was basically a rehash of the first one withChristmas thrown in. However I did like adding their moms to the mix.Susan Sarandon as Kathryn Hahn's mom in particular was one of the morefunny ones because they were so similar. It was also a pretty enjoyableChristmas movie and kind of got me in the Christmas spirit even thoughHalloween literally just ended. Obviously it's not an It's a WonderfulLife classic but a good Christmas comedy. Overall I like the theme of afilm being called Bad Moms when they're all trying pretty hard to begood moms that just realize they can never be perfect. I like that mostmoms can relate to at least one of the characters. And yes if they madea third called Bad Grandmas which they pretty much made it look likethey would, or at least could, I would see it.
