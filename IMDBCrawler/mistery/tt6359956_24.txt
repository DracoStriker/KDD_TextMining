I saw "A Bad Moms Christmas", starring Mila Kunis-Jupiter Ascending,The Book of Eli; Kristen Bell-How To Be a Latin Lover, Scream 4;Kathryn Hahn-Captain Fantastic, Step Brothers; Christine Baranski-TheBig Bang Theory_tv, The Bounty Hunter; Cheryl Hines-Son of Zorn_tv, RVand Susan Sarandon-Tammy_2014, Mr. Woodcock. This is a sequel to the2016 minor hit, Bad Moms. It seemed like the producers were in a rushto get this movie out-it has barely been a year since the firstone-because even though there are some laughs, it's pretty predictable.Mila, Kristen and Kathryn are still besties and they are all gettingready for Christmas and all the pressures that go along with theseason-planning parties, shopping for gifts, decorating....well, youknow the drill. That is when all three of their mothers decide tovisit, at the same time-can you believe it? Christine is Mila'sdisapproving mom-nothing Mila does is good enough. Cheryl is Kristen'soverly clingy mom-she spends all of her time with Kristen and evenwants to move in next door to her. Susan is Kathryn's free-spiritedabsentee mom-she gambles, smokes marijuana and doesn't come around foryears at a time. The best thing about the movie is the cast-greatcasting. The worst thing is the recycled material-unless you thinklittle kids using the 'F' word or someone calling a person by adifferent name every time she sees them is funny. As the end creditsstart, there is a scene with the entire cast dancing. It's rated "R"for language, drug use and sexual content-partial nudity-and has arunning time of 1 hour & 44 minutes. It's not one that I would buy onDVD but it would be alright as a rental, if you liked the first one.
