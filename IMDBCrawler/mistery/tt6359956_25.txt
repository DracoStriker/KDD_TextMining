OK let's start with the horrible ratings that A bad moms Christmas got.Those people do not know good movies. A bad moms Christmas is anexcellent movie way better than I thought. I am not a huge fan of thefirst Bad Moms, but let me tell you I am a fan of the second one. A badmoms Christmas is an awesome and funny movie, the difference with thesecond movie is the new characters of the girls parents. ChristineBaransky steals the show, her character is sooo funny and KatherineHahn is amazing and funny too! A bad moms Christmas really capturedChristmas, for filming it 6 months ago in the summer it really lookedlike Christmas time, the cinematography in the film is outstanding too.Just go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
