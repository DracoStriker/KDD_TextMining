Bad Moms came out last year and was not very original but was reallygood,it was basically Mean Girls but if it takes place yearslater,now,A Bad Moms Christmas has finally came out and I was veryexcited to see it although I never really got to pay attention to it oreven see the trailer,from what I heard,the film received prettynegative reviews from when it came out two weeks ago,but I loved it!Bad Moms Christmas is actually nothing like the first film,in the firstfilm,it had a mean parent group at school and in this film,its a groupof posh and annoying moms,which I really liked. The film dose have somebads though,the film has a really long pace and then when the endinghits,it was not really even that good,at least in the ending of BadMoms,it was a bit exciting,this was just..ya know,pretty unoriginal.But otherwise,Bad Moms Xmas is a really good sequel to a really goodcomedy
