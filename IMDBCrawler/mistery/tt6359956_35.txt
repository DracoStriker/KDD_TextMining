I looked at the cast for this film and I am a fan of the "mothers" so Ithought I would relax on a rainy afternoon and enjoy some laughs, and Ilike holiday films in general.First disappointment was having youngsters using fowl language. This isa film with children yet with the "R" rating children can't see it, andthey shouldn't. Children swearing in films is never a good idea, it'snot creative and it's just a bad thing to do.This film was way over the top making every aspect of the film far fromrealistic, too heavy handed. Twenty minutes into the film I knew Icould not sit still so I went to customer service and said I needed toleave, I felt nauseated, so they cheerfully gave me a voucher to seeanother film when I am feeling better. I must take better care in choosing films. I won't even bother withthis film when it comes to Netflix~
