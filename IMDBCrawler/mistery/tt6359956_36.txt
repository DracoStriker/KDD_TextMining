This movie was such fun! Even though my friend and I were both blessedwith fabulous mothers, she and I have both known far too manygirlfriends who have quite contentious relationships with moms whodon't have a clue. This movie rang so true for us! Three modern-daymoms are trying to do the best they can, with two being single moms.Their mothers all decide to come for the holidays - after all, who candeny family at that time of year? And, being good daughters, the youngwomen try to be hospitable while their moms trample all over theirdaughters' plans. Hilarious fun for a girls' night out!
