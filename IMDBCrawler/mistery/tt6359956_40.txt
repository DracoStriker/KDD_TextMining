The prototypical example of what happens when female characters arewritten and directed by clueless men. With six supremely talentedfemale actors leading this movie, it nevertheless ends up being ashallow and even embarrassing caricature of females in general andmother-and-daughter relationships in particular. Too many of the setupsand resolutions between the women in this movie undermine everythingfemale actors have been begging for in the way of good film roles forwomen. I was just depressed after enduring this unfunny holiday tale.And I'm a male. So there.
