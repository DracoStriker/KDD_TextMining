. . . "BAD MOMS CHR!STMAS?" One assumes that such deplorable Americansas John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wayne Gacy, Don JuanRump, Robert E. Lee, and Devin Patrick Kelley ALL had "bad moms," butdoes anyone know for sure? Sometimes babies are found floating throughswamps in baskets. At other times, when you dig up the caskets of thealleged maternal parent of a particular problem tyke such as the graveof Damien's birth mom in THE OMEN, you find the bones of a jackal. ABAD MOMS CHRI$TMA$ is full of other sour notes. One of the deplorablemothers tells her lover during the first few minutes of this story that"You've definitely getting the GOLD STAR treatment tonight." Aftercurrent White House occupant Rump made such a stink about Gold Starfamilies last summer, EVERY American knows that the "Gold StarTreatment" involves a 21-gun salute and a triangular-folded U.S. Flagbeing presented to a crying lady dressed in black! Similarly, A BADMOMS CHR!STMAS ends with the three superannuated chicks flying to LasVegas to see some musician from the 1900s before he dies. It's reallyin quite poor taste to suggest that other millionaires and billionairesfrom the Steve Bannon\Steve Paddock Red Commie KGB Sister Party, Rump'sInfamous KKK Repug "Machine-Gunners" Bunch (aka, The Goopers) arelikely to gun down EVERY stale musical act by this New Year's Eve.Doubtless some of these Cathy's Clowns will hunker down in the Fall-OutShelter Bunkers built during the Cuban Missile Crisis before the BumpStock Boys can wipe out all of them!
