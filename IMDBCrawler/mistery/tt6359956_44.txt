I enjoyed the first movie a lot, but this sequel is lousy. I decided tostop watching after 5 minutes. It has a lot of cheap jokes, lots of unnecessary cursing, including auntasteful, loud, repeated cursing by a little girl(so far I can'tunderstand why people mix cursing with the word God (omfg), it's sodisrespectful and so tacky). Mila's character is so different in thismovie, mostly in a bad way, cursing a lot now. The bad cliché about thevisiting parents and the overacting by the parents (except Baranski'sacting). The first one had great songs which is a big part that ismissing on the sequel.Don't waste your time.
