***This review may contain spoilers***A Bad Moms Christmas is a hilarious, mischievous, raunchy tale withstacks of heart and camaraderie between this lovable group of moms. The sequel is wilder and than the original and the introduction of theperfectly cast grand moms (Sarandon, Baranski and Hines) makes forplenty of very relatable mother-daughter moments that make one want toboth cover her face in horrified agreement and call her mom to tell hershe loves her all at the same time. The friendship between the three equally talented and charismaticleads; moms Amy (Kunis), Carla (Hahn) and Kiki (Bell) is fun, at easeand feels incredibly organic and their sincere and very human devotionto their kids in their own unique ways combined with that unapologetic,playful rebel streak make this new journey of the moms entertaining,engaging and realistic. Christine Baranski's immaculate comedic timing and portrayal of theoverbearing, snobby but somewhat endearing Ruth is ridiculously onpoint and Carla's (Kathryn Hahn's) scenes with Ty (Justin Hartley) hadthe entire cinema in hysterics. A counseling session with (WandaSyke's) Dr. Karl will make you - as a daughter (or son) cry big, uglytears and the doting, charming (Peter Gallagher) as Hank stepping in totry to calm the waters are two of the moments that I think reallyanchor this film as not just a lively, festive, raunchy comedy, but assomething many will relate to, especially at Christmas.
