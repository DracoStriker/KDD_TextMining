Loved the original, paid to see it three times at a theater. This is(for me) the WORST film of the year. The characters, particularly Hahnand Sarandons are repugnant, repellent and even I am embarrassed forthem. What a waste of a terrific cast! I laughed ONCE (a joke aboutSarandon's characters name) and that was it. I was really lookingforward to this, but sadly, it seems as if the first film was a flukeor just dumb luck that it turned out as well as it did. I love raunchyR rated comedy but this Bad Mom is one BAD MOTHAH! 1/10.
