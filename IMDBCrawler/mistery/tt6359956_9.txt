This movie consists of a boring story line with an unnecessaryChristmas theme. While some of the actors gave me hope of this moviebeing watchable, you will only feel dread as it drags on and on withoutany memorable scenes and a bronze lining of generic nonsensical comedy.Nothing but a seasonal money grab, huge waste of time.
