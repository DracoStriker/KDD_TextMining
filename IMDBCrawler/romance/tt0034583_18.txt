Spoilers ahead.I didn't understand the film properly until I read Danny Peary's essay on itin the first of his three "Cult Movies" books (which, by the way, you MUSTread, although you should be aware that Peary's complaints about "The RedShoes" aren't even near the mark).  The key (and, in retrospect, obvious)insight is this: all along, Captain Renault WANTED Rick to become a heroagain.  As long as Rick was content to adopt a cynical, self-servingattitude, Renault, a man made of lesser material, had an excuse to do thesame - and he wanted that excuse to be denied him.  When it WAS denied himhe was delighted.  THAT'S he joined the side of the angels, without evenhesitating.  (It's also why he spent so much time earlier poking fun ofRick's former idealism, in an attempt to get Rick to defend it.)  Thisprobably strikes many people as obvious; I regret to say I had to have itpointed out to me.I don't have to argue that this is a great film.  We all know it is.  Pearycalls it the ONLY film that's everything the old-style studio films weretrying to be, and he's probably right.  This doesn't, of course, mean thatit's the BEST film of the 1940s; better still are the bolder, more ambitiousproductions made by more inspired directors: "Citizen Kane", "The RedShoes", "Fantasia", and so forth.  But "Casablanca" is probably as high asit is possible to fly without making a Philistine studio executive reach forhis heart tablets.  This is higher praise than it sounds.  And if you thinkit IS the best film of the 1940s, after all ... well, I can see your pointof view.
