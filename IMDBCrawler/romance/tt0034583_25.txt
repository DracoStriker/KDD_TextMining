When people ask me what is the best movie of all-time is I don't flinch, Ijust say "Casablanca". It has everything a great movie should have:romance,sacrifice, wonderful lines, a memorable song, incredible acting (even inthesmallest roles) and it is one of the few non-film noir movies filmed intheB&W era that I wouldn't want to see refilmed in color (that is in definitecontrast to "I Know Where I'm Going!" which begs to be refilmed to showthebeauty of its vistas). But the key that makes everything works is theending. I don't think the ending that exists in Casablanca could be filmedtoday and though most have seen this movie (or any of its parodies) Idon'twant to give anything away. But I encourage you to compare the ending ofthis movie with the endings of other romantic movies such as "An Affair toRemember", "Sleepless in Seattle" and even the most recent animated"Sinbad"movie. Contrast their endings with Casablanca's ending and you see howCasablanca resonates. Many movies have tried to emulate the ending ofCasablanca but it never quite rings true because hollywood movies aren'tallowed to have this ending yet the only ones who try are eitherindependentor anti-hollywood.
