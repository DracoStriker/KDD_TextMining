If all films were made like "Casablanca" it would be a perfect world.  Veryrarely does a film move its audience the way that this film does.  The moviedeals with a romance that just cannot be because of numerous circumstances. World War II is quickly turning the planet upside down and many Europeansare making their way to Casablanca to get visas to escape the Nazi regime. Paul Henreid and wife Ingrid Bergman are among the many who have made theodyssey.  However, trouble springs up when they must go through Bergman'sold flame (Humphrey Bogart, Oscar-nominated).  More trouble arises withFrench military official Claude Rains (Oscar-nominated) and his strainedrelations with the Nazis.  It is a heartwrenching film that dominatesbecause of an outstanding screenplay, amazing direction by Michael Curtiz,and superb performances by all involved.  A great movie.  5 stars out of5.
