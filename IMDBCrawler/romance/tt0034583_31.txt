Every thing positive everyone has ever said about this movie is true.  Stillcompelling after all these years, one of my top ten movies, I can go backand watch every few years.This movie works on every level, drama, love story, suspense, but most ofall it is a war propaganda movie.  Pro war, pro allies, anti Nazi, even alittle anti French, this movie was made smack in the middle of WWII when theoutcome was still in doubt and designed get the public behind the wareffort.  It sure was more fun then those 'Victory gardens, paper drives andgas rationing' and other techniques to get public support.  It is impossiblefor a film made for this purpose to stand the test of time, but Casablancahas, and that's why it is such an incredible film.
