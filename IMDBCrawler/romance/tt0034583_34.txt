Everyone, for as long as I can remember, has harped on about how good thisfilm is. Now I'm quite a cynical person, so for a very long time I avoidedit, not wanting to jump on the ever popular band wagon. Well, a while agoahappened across a cheap DVD version of it and thought (for some unknownreason) why not?We (me and the wife) put it on one Saturday night and sat down with somewine........we now have 3 Bogart films and are looking out formore.If you don't like the sound of this film, give it a try. I was shocked athow good it was! Honestly, I couldn't have been more surprised if in TheGreat Escape instead of digging out they ended up building sandcastles andthinking "this is jolly good fun, lets stay here instead". It really isthatgood!!
