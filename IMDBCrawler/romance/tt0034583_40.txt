I discovered this movie about 15 years ago. I'm 33-years-old and had neverreally been one to go back and watch old black-and-white movies. The firstmovie I ever really remember going to see at the theater was Raiders of theLost Ark. I was in love with the movies from then on. Oh, sure, I'd gone tothe drive-in in rural Alabama and had seen various movies. But I had beentoo young and immature to really appreciate them for what they were. Butwhen my uncle took me to see Raiders, I was hooked. For years, I consideredSpielberg's masterpiece to be the best movie ever made. But then I happenedto get hold of a VHS copy of Casablanca and checked it out. WOW! Moviemakinghad been redefined for me. This movie has it all. Bogart is such anincredible presence. I think Harrison Ford is our modern-day answer toBogart. The story is so straight-forward and so cool ... the backstory aboutthe romance in Paris is great, perfectly handled. The one-liners areunforgettable, and the songs are enchanting. This is the whole package,alright. Perfect movie.
