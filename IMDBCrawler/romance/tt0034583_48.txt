SPOILERS Possibly containedOk, Casablanca can simply be described in six words "The Greatest Movie OfAll Time". In this film we get to witness Bogart & Bergman in their best performances,in one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) love stories of all time. Theway the romance develops, disintegrates, develops again & finishes on a sadnote, is one of the best film plots of all time. The acting is superb, theplot is majestic, the film may be in black and white (an idea which is oftensadly dated in modern society, but not in this case) but it survives & bythe end of this film, possibly the most famous movie scene of all time isshown, climaxing in what can be argued as the greatest line of all time.I guess the problem with writing reviews is that it's often easy to writevast ammounts about a film you hate, but when it comes to a film you love,you embrace it to such a degree that it's almost impossible to think ofanything fresh and original to write.so, with that last statement in mind, let me say this. If you have neverseen Casablanca, you must be mad. If you have seen Casablanca and dislikeit, you must be even madder. This film is genius, pure, classicalgenius.
