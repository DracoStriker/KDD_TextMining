The Petrified Forest convinced the world Bogart was a bad guy. And foryears he shocked and awed the audience with roles fitting that image.The Maltese Falcon showed a new kind hero, one with an edge. Bogart,with all the right things to say and seemingly never losing his cool.Then came Casablanca and the ages. The man's ? man comes with a heart.Arguably, three of his best pictures. All showing a change in a man'scharacter and the depths of what acting is supposed to be. Maybe it wasWarner Bros all along. Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.What can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 yearssince its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase forBogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to everlive? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, morelikely to infect rather than effect.She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, "You're verykind." Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid,Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created.But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for meto believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films,it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'mstill trying to figure him out."I should never have switched from scotch to martinis." Is said to beBogart's last words. A legend, indeed.
