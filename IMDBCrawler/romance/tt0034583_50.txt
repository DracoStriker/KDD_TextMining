For years and years (I'm 52), I've always heard how great this movieis. I've really never gotten into old movies a whole bunch, so I'venever seen Bogart much at all. SO - it was time to finally watch it.Yawn... For starters, Bogart just wasn't that good of an actor. Screamand cry all you want, but that's an unbiased fact. Secondly, the storyline was about as average as you could get. Finally, I seriously hadtrouble staying awake in this one. Cannot for the life of me see whatso many others see in it.A sad disappointment. I'll give it a 4, as I honestly would have to sayit's slightly below average...
