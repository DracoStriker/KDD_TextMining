"This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship" ? that is how thisunforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love,friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes placein the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see thecity (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life ofthe city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape fromthe horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nightsfull of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. Thelove story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories inthe currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger andlarger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, isshow in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie isblack-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also acolor version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. Ifyou have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. Andif you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.
