I watched Casablanca for a class, and, while I initially thought that Iwouldn't care for it, I find myself being able to confidently say thatit's actually one of my favorite movies, not just from the class butalso in general. In terms of acting character and plot the movie isjust superb, the best performance being, obviously, from HumphreyBogart. Technically, the movie is one of the best that I've seen fromthat period of time. The camera is EXTREMELY mobile, especially inRick's Café, moving between the tables and sweeping the expanse of thedining room. The sweeps of the streets were incredible, and the shotsseemed to be getting longer, which was nice to see. The most notablething, technically, was the sweep of the airport as Ilsa and Laszlo'splane takes off. Overall an amazing movie, something I would definitelyrecommend both for the storyline and for the technical elements.
