What could have been another piece of dreary American propaganda forWWII, turned out- by a strange piece of magic- to be a cinematicmasterpiece, and ultimately a legend. Was it the director, MichaelCurtiz? Was it the black and White photography, was it Dooley Wilson'shaunting voice. Was it the superb casting? Who knows? but to think ofanyone else playing the roles would have been insanity. Another SydneyGreenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, Bogart or Bergman. Impossible.About four years ago I was travelling around south-east Asia and inPhnom Penh (in Cambodia) and one night I went to the ForeignCorrespondants club. It was my birthday and I was on my own so I stayedfor a few drinks. I then found out that the club was showing THEORIGINAL Casablanca. The benches the audience sat on were wooden. Therewere geckos running around the ceiling, no air conditioning, and it washeaven. The visa pronounced vezay, the gloved hand holding the'aeroplane' Sydney Greenstreet swatting flies. Wonderful.
