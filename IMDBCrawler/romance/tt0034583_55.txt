The Germans sing stilllouder, but they're no match for the pro-French civilians. Drowned out,the soldiers give up in disgust. The "Marseillaise" comes to itsstirring conclusion, and with tears in their eyes the patriots in thebar cry out, "Vive la France!"This scene always brings tears to my eyes which illustrates, amongother things, the power of music in movies.What is your favorite scene in 'Casablanca'?
