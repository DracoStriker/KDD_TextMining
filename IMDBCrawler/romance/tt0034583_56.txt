This movie can compete with the most famous and timeless love storiesin history, like Romeo & Julia, the beauty and the beast, Julia Robertsand Richard Geere.Always remember while you watch it: 1942. Not such a nice time for theworld! Not such a nice time for romance. Not such a nice time to standup against something. It must have been quite an effort to shoot thisfilm during such harsh times. I mean, it's quite a political movie andthe scene with the Marseillaise must have been a punch in the face ofevery fascist.But all the political quarrels are combined with an amazing love storythat hasn't lost a single ounce of its attraction or beauty throughoutthe years.But what really made a classic out of the picture is, in my opinion,Humphrey Bogart. I consider him the man of the millennium, a guy withso much masculine attitude and yet so much feeling. It's just aneye-catching experience to see him walk and talk and, most impressive,drink. Any other actor drinks quite ordinary. It's not a big deal toempty a glass of booze. But when Bogie does it, you can feel his pain.You can feel his grief and his anger. You can feel the person behindthe scene. If you ask me for the man I respect the most in moviehistory, it has to be Humphrey Bogart.Sure, the rest of the cast does a great job as well, Ignrid Bergmann isresponsible for half of the chemistry between Rick and Ilsa but well, Ican only see them in the shadow of Bogie.This is one of those movies, you hear so much talking about and youbegin to ask what's so great about a dusty old flick, but after you'vewatched it, you realize what everybody was talking about. At least,that's how I did.A truly timeless tale about romance with the perfect cast and probablythe most memorable quotes in history. Terrific!
