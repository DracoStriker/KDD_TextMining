Casablanca is the sort of film that suffers from its reputation. Peoplewalk into it expecting to see the greatest film of all time and aredisappointed when it doesn't measure up to their own pet faves. But ifit doesn't have the depth of some masterpieces, it is certainly amongthe most entertaining, with a brilliantly witty script, a superb castand one of the most stirring scenes in all cinema, the so-called BattleOf The Anthems when Laszlo incites Rick's patrons in a recital of LaMarseillaise. It also broke social ground, with Sam the pianist (DooleyWilson) being one of the first black roles to be treated as (almost) anequal. Most of all, it's a film you can watch again and again. If youhaven't yet, give it a try; it could be the start of a beautifulfriendship.
