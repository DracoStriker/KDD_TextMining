"Casablanca" is unquestionably one of the two greatest American films.Everything about it (except possibly the special effects) is eitherperfect or so close it doesn't even matter. I'm writing this havingjust gone to see it with my sweetie at a packed-house Valentine's Dayshowing in a restored classic movie palace. If you ever have the chanceto see a beautiful print of this film on a really big screen in such avenue, with an audience totally in love with it, DO NOT DO NOT DO NOTpass up the opportunity! When people used to refer to the "silverscreen," it's this movie and a few others that they were talkingabout--it literally shimmers like finely wrought silver.Oh yes, the other greatest American film? "Citizen Kane," and for manyof the same reasons. Interesting that these two films were made almostat the same time, "CK" being released in 1941 and "Casablanca" in 1942.
