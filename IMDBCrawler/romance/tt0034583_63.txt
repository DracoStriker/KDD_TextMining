Casablanca (1942), pretty close to perfection. A movie that brings outthe best script from both heart n brain, a tough combination. Does aperfect job in blending the political scenario of that time (World War2) and the ever pervasive love matters. Just 102 minutes movie but eachsecond is entertaining. The clever-stylish dialogues keep it alivethroughout. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman from their very1st shot together, looks very natural. I wonder why they don't makesuch well developed movies today. Before watching the movie I did someother viewer comments saying it is all so boring but one thing theymight be missing is that these were the movies from which directorsused stuff again and again and that is why they look boring to us. ButI guess we should at least respect them for this. A keeper, 10/10.
