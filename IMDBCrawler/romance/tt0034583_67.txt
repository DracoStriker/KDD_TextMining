There are movie classics and there are movie classics. And then thereis "Casablanca." Shot in 1942, it is over sixty years old and more thanholds its own against anything that one can throw up against it today.For Humphrey Bogart, this was a career defining moment that launchedthe Bogie mystique. Ingrid Bergman's performance is nothing less thanscintillating. The cast of supporting actors and actresses issuperlative. This is one of the rare movies that makes the viewersuspend disbelief. Almost everything in the movie is first rate. Theediting was superb with no extraneous scenes. There is no fat. It is amovie in which extremes exist and yet there is no contradiction. It isthe rarest kind of movie that can be watched a hundred times and yet,one never tires of it. "Casablanca" is pure cinema magic that few, ifany, movies will ever match. Words cannot reach it. "Casablanca" is anexperience that one simply has to experience and preferably, at leastonce, on a big screen. On a scale of one to ten with ten being best, itis an easy one hundred.
