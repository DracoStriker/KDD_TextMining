Regardless of when the first time you saw Casablanca was, the movie willalways remain timeless.  Boggie plays the sarcastic and charismatic RickBlaine and the beautiful Ingrid Bergman plays the lovely Ilsa, the onlywoman Rick ever loved who comes back into his life after abruptly leavinghim.  "Of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world, she comeswalking into mine."The ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, Casablanca is a movie that despitehow much times change, this film never loses its magic. From a personal standpoint, I am not that big a fan of older movies (whatsome people dub "classics".  I generally don't like any film made before1960.  I find the acting generally cheesy.  But along with On TheWaterfront, Casablanca is still one of the most amazing movies ever made. Highly recommended.  Don't go to the video store and rent it, just go buyit.
