Casablanca is the closest thing to a perfect movie that has ever been made. It's the perfect length to tell its story but not drag, and it has suspense,humor, drama, romance, music, and everything else you would want in a movie. Screw the AFI-Casablanca is the single best movie ever to come out ofHollywood and I doubt it will ever be topped.
