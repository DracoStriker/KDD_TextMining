This film works surprisingly well sixty years after its original release.The story unfolds, and as it does it genuinely sucks the viewer in. Youactually care about what happens to these people.The pictures are beautiful and the acting is superb. Bogart of causeshimmers with his unique mix of poppy eyes, heart broken righteousness, andvery masculine stoutness. Yes - we have yet to see hislike.It's easy: 10/10(ohh: By the way, all the actors are marvellous characters: From the fat,patriotic waiter, to the French police inspector ? and needless to mention:Ingrid Berman!)
