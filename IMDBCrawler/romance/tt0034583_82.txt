Wow! The first time I watched Casablanca in school. But I didn't get toseeall of it. So I rented it and watched it at least 5 times in one night.It'sso great and I just love Ingrid Bergman playing Ilsa Lund. Her appearanceand her lines. My favorite line of her: "You know how much I loved you,howmuch I still love you" But in general I think this movie just rocks thecinema. I have seen it once on the big screen and it was so different fromwatching it on TV.I bought that film in two versions (english+german) and I'm planning onbuying it in italian, too. I can only say that it's the best movie I'veeverseen and that it's my favorite one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bergman's thebest!
