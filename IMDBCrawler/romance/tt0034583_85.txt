Any film with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman would be worthwhilewatching.  However this film keeps one's attention from the beginning anddoesn't let go until the end.  The writing was excellent.  The actingalsothe same.  The story line is a classic.  This is the nearest to perfect afilm has ever become.  Godfather is close also, but Casablanca is thebest!!!
