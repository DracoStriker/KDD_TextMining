Look up the word "classic" in the dictionary and Casablanca it there.  Itisas perfect as a movie gets.  The writing, the pauses, the looks, the love,the humor - all in perfect time.  The shadows, the music even thebackgroundactors and noise blend to make each scene seem real. Even the "bitplayers"are some of the best that Hollywood ever had.
