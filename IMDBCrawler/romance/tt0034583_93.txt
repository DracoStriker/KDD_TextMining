Pay no mind to the nattering nabobs of negativism who say that this movie isas stale as your granddaddy's underwear.  Casablanca rocks, dude.  You mustremember this: 1) a kiss is still a kiss but only between consenting adulthumans; 2) a sigh is just a sigh, except when it comes from the CFO of yourbankrupt company; 3) the original  version of Casablanca featuredinterpretative belly dancing by the Moroccan Sisters of Mercy and a reallygreat bondage scene between Rick and Ilsa (the chorus line with the shavedmacaques was a nice touch too).  It's really a shame those scenes never madeit out of Jack Warner's closet.  However, thedeliriously pointed dramatic tension  of the "La Marseilles/Wacht amRhein" karaoke grudge match at Rick's is one of the most incisive allegoriesfor the shifting tides of WWII ever burned into celluloid.  You canvirtually feel the tension sweeping across Major Strasser's face as herealizes the triumphant reemergence of French idealism and the fact that hislactose intolerance has ruined yet another Nazi uniform.  I thought that thecomplexity of the love triangle was presented very tastefully, although somehave pointed out that Victor was seeking Mexican herbs in the secret gardenfor far too long.Ilsa eventually got her revenge.  But at what cost?  The dog would no longerhunt, the sun wouldn't shine and the pasta primavera would never be aldente.  It's a good thing they had Paris before she became a nun. She builta birdhouse in her soul but it was later leased to Starbucks.  The mysteriesof romance go full circle in this flick.  Whew.  It's getting hot in here.
