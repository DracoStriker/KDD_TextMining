The lasting attraction of this film must be its seemingly effortless useofthe medium.  We know that Casablanca was at the time one of dozens of"cardboard cutout" features from Warner Brothers' World War Two domesticaudience assembly line.  This film was not intended to be a classic.  Whathappened?  One can watch this movie without sound and marvel at the humanstruggle in northern Africa. Did Michael Curtiz perfect his directorialtechnique during the silent film era?  Obviously his silent filmexperienceis evident.  Why watch Casablanca with the sound off?  One would miss theorchestration by Max Steiner and vocal by Arthur Dooley.  The dialogue isvery rich, the plot compelling and acting perfect.  Someone will try toconvince you that this whole effort was well planned.  My understanding isthat it was not.  This film is an accident that happens only once everyfewgenerations and it is a joy to experience again and again.
