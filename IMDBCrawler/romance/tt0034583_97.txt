This movie is just flat out good.  It still holds up after 60 years, andforexcellent reason.  The performances, though more over-the-top than what weare used to today, are spot on.  The story is simple but effectivelymoving,and the movie is entertaining from beginning to end.  The musical score ismagical.Casablanca is simply a fine example of classical Hollywood cinema.  Iwatched it with a degree of skepticism, not expecting the movie to live upto its hype, but I was pleasantly surprised when if far exceeded myexpectations.  The story is interesting and the script is well-written.Allof the characters are strongly crafted, and the acting is superb.  I givethis movie the 10 it deserves.
