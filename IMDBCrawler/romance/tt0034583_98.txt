I liked this film because it did not only have an intriguing plot but it isalso a very famous film and it was an educational experience watching it. Ihad heard of this film but had been lost when references were made to it orit was compared to another film. Having watched it has let me understandwhat everyone was talking about. I also liked it because it had a good mixof action, suspense, and romance. The action (like gunfights) was not overpowering merely a backdrop for the plot. The suspense added to the storyline and also kept my interest.  The romance was necessary for it made upthe bulk of the conflict. I was satisfied with the conclusion of theromanceat the end it was not melodramatic or gushy. Also this was the first time Ihad seen Humphrey Bogart in a film, like the film I had only heard ofBogartso again this added to enlightenment factor of the film.
