I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  If you're in a position toseeit in a proper cinema, then make every effort to do so, as the subtlety ofthe lighting and set design doesn't quite make it through onvideo...There's not a single element of this movie that I can conceive of beingimproved upon.  The casting, direction, acting, score, lighting, script...All mesh together simply perfectly in a way I've never seen on any othermovie.  Bring tissues - I'm a fat, cynical, 40-year old Scotsman, and Istill cry every time I see it. :)
