I am a huge fan of Grease. I've seen the play and I've watched the movie atleast 500 times. It captures everything high school is about. Even though itis set in the 50's, it seems to resonate even for today's generation. JohnTravolta and Olivia Newton-John are great in the movie as well as the restof the cast. I met the girl of my dreams when I took her on a date to seethe play, so this film has a special place in my heart.
