Possible minor spoilers ahead:I hated this movie when I saw it in the theatres when I was ten.  I didn'tknow why until I saw it done on stage years later at a local high school.The movie (and play) tell you that you're not good enough as you are;thatto have people like you, you have to change.  The final scene makes itclearthat being yourself isn't good enough.  You have to conform to the will ofothers in order to be happy.  And making the woman the one who has tochangeis sexist.  Then, misogny backhands you like an abusive husband bysexuallyobjectifying the change.  Look, now she has to be a hussy to have a happyending.Simply disgusting.  Easily one of the worst movies ever made.
