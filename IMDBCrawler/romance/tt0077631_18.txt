Having seen this film I am of the opinion that it is one of the mostover-rated films ever. Its basically juvenile piffle, a very weak storyline is compounded by equally poor acting from the entire cast, this isa film that should never have got further than the cutting room floor.nThe storyline has been done so many times and in the case of this filmresults in a truly awful film of epic proportions. As per usual, itaims to portray the American way of life as squeaky clean and thesoundtrack is so poor, it beggars belief that the songs released intothe pop charts fared so well. John Travolta proves once again what aone-dimensional actor he really is, whilst Olivia Newton John shows noability whatsoever. I truly recommend anybody who has not yet watchedthis puerile trite not to bother
