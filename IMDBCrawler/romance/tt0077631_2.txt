This play turned movie is one my favorites. It has mostly anything youcould ask for. Being a romance, comedy, musical and so much more, makesit unique. John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing, DidiCohn, Jeff Conaway and so many more make this an all-star hit. Thismovie well illustrates what the 50s was all about. I must say, anyonewho thinks its ovverrated or anything else bad must've not reallythought and seen how amazing this classic is. I will keep and treasuremy 20th anniversary DVD to share with my children, my children'schildren, and so on. The vocals in this film are outstanding, with thebreath-taking voice of Olivia Newton-John, and John Travolta's rocknumbers. Its a timeless hit that will have people enjoying itthroughout the ages.
