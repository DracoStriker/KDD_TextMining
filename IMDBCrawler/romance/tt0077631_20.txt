This is a sexist piece of rubbish. The girl has to get into tightclothes and talk about shaping up to be with the guy who supposedlylikes her as she is (as long as his friends aren't around while she isas she is). Way to tell girls they need to be fake and put onprostitutes clothing to get a boy and way to tell boys how to treatgirls and what to expect from them.The songs and script also degrade girls. Any girl who has a boyfriendand everyone knows she is "putting out" is labeled a tramp and teasedwhile the guys get to dance around dry humping on the pussy wagon likecave men and celebrating while sharing stories of their conquests (evenfake stories i.e. that in "Summer loving" from his perspective).A really unattractive and sleazy adult male is able to pick up a minorfemale student at a dancing contest purely because he's on the radioand no other adults care or notice. No sex offender registry for thatobvious repeat offender with his smooth "I'm in your bedroom" line.I'm not the first to mention this but the actors are so old most ofthem should have been playing the parents of school kids. StockardChanning even had freckles obviously drawn on her face with an eyelinerpencil to make her look younger. It didn't work.Overall the songs are catchy and if you don't listen to the lyrics youmight think it's a cute love story. Listen to the lyrics and you'll seewhat the real message and purpose of the movie is. Encouraging youngpeople to change themselves because they think what someone else wantsis more important than what they want. A fake greasy life they willregret later dressed up in a flying car.
