The dumbness of this film, and its mediocre production values, make itshitstatus an utter mystery.  Like the television show, "Happy Days", "Grease"is a 70's version of the 50's.  Not for a second are you lost in thedecadein which the film is set.  It is far too 1970's in its feel, for that.Thefilm's only appeal comes from its two stars, the only cast members wholookyoung enough to be in high school.  The rest of the over-the-hill gangmugsand overacts, shamelessly.  It is horribly directed and the musicalnumberslook like rejects from a much better show.  The film of course isn'tentirely to blame.  The stage production of "Grease", is just as bad.Perhaps worse.  It's all a matter of taster. So if "Grease" is the wordforyou, then by all means, enjoy.  I didn't.
