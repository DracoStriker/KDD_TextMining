Greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) returns from a summer of love withsweet girl Sandy Olsen (Olivia Newton-John). Instead of going back toAustralia, she ends up in the same school as him. Danny is the leaderof the T-Birds while Sandy joins up with the Pink Ladies. Danny can'tquite bring himself to show his soft side in front of all the guys.This is a fun musical above all else. The music is infectious. OliviaNewton-John is wonderful singer, and actually quite a lovely actress.John Travolta is a good song and dance man. Some of the actors arepushing the age limit like Stockard Channing, but none of it matters asmuch the joy of this movie.
