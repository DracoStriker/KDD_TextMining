Grease is directed by Randal Kleiser and stars John Travolta, OliviaNewton-John, Stockard Channing & Jeff Conaway. It's co-written by JimJacobs, Warren Casey (Musical), Bronte Woodard &Allan Carr.1958 and Danny (Travolta) has a holiday romance with the pretty andvirginal Sandy (Newton-John). She ends up going to the same high schoolas he, but he's under peer pressure to stay cool and uphold a tough guyimage. They fall out, argue, make up, their friends are equallyunstable. Oh and there's the small matter of some truly memorable songsand dances too.As full of gusto as it is cheese, Grease is the musical that's hard todislike. The acting is so-so, the direction one dimensional and theplot could have been written on a 50s beer mat. Yet we love it becauseof its faults, the kooky charm that sidles up alongside those roaringtunes. We care not that these actors are too old to play highschoolers, the fun is watching them have fun being teens again. Hellthere's even innuendo unbound and cheeky lyrics for those of an adultmind. A truly great fun movie that's longevity shows no time of endingany time soon. Watch it, enjoy, sing along, pick a favourite tune andcharacter, and then salute it; for Grease is the word baby. 9/10
