The movie has proved more durable than anyone would have thought. Ittook substantial critical hits for being a Califoria-ized,Olivia-Newton-John-ized adaptation of a beloved, long-running New Yorkshow. At least, we mused at the time, they changed the story so theywouldn't have to make Ms Newton-John affect any sort of Americanaccent: certainly not a New York one.And yet it seems to stand up well on its own. The New Yorker observedat the time that nobody involved with this movie was alive during theera it was supposed to depict, but they clearly had a fine time withthe music. Yes, the scenes were clearly from sunny 1970's California,but this didn't bother the kids who saw this in 1978, and enough timehas passed that it shouldn't bother us who remember that it wassupposed to be in Brooklyn, in the '50's.Have fun, kids.
