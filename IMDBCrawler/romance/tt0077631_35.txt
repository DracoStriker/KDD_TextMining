i just love this musical! But then, I'm a sucker for musicals, so that maynot tell you much. Grease will have you singing along by the second verse ofnearly every song, and the 'Thunder Road' scene will have you wondering,'Who will win!?!?' (And probably also 'How the heck can they allow people tohave spikes on their tires like that!?!?') To sum it up in a fewwords:'Grease is the word, is the word, that you heard! It's got groove, it's gotmeaning... Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion, Grease is theway we are feeling!'
