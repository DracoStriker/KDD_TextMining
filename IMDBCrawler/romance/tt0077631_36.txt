Saw this the other night after many years. And my thoughts haven'tchange. It has to be one of the worst cast movies in history. Forstarters, the cast is way to old! Next time you're out take a look asome high school seniors. Do they even look close to the age of theactors? Stockard Channing looks like someone's mother - not a highschool girl. The whole story line is equally bad. Everyone is so dumbit's pathetic. John Travolta didn't know that punching a guy in thestomach while playing basketball was against the rules? The finaltransformation of Sandy at the end was the worst. She goes from freshfaced, pretty girl next door, to wearing an outfit best suite for aporn star, and looks like she's going to walk the streets for money.This COULD have been a good movie if they cast age appropriate actorsand made it a believable story.
