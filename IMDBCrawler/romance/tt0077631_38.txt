I'm not a very big fan of musicals, I'm more of an action-movie guy,but this one has somehow managed to become one of my favorite movies!The songs are catchy (even for a Heavy Metal fan like me!) and thefeelgood mood is amazing here. The plot is pretty predictable, and youcan guess how it all ends already after five minutes, but who cares?Cause the movie takes you there in a fantastic way! Travoltas acting isgood and some of his facial-expressions are incredible. The 50s feelGrease have is also very good, and the characters in this movie are alllikable. And the way Olivia Newton John looks in "You're The One That IWant" is incredible. That part makes the whole movie worth watching byitself. There are many other unforgettable moments to. Like "GreasedLightning" and much more. See this movie, even if you're not a big fanof the genre, you might end up liking it. Cause it got humor, songs,drama and heart. An absolute classic.
