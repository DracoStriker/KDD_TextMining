Rated PG for Sexual Innuendos,Language and Teen Smoking/Drinking Grease is a musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton John.Imust say, im not really a big fan of the musical genre but there are afew that I enjoy.This is one of them.The songs are pretty catchy andthe movie has a fairly good plot.Its a teen film set in the 1950's likeAmerican Graffiti and Lemon Popsicle only this is not as serious asthose movies.The film is about two teenagers who meet and fall in loveover the summer but the girl says she has to move back to Austrailiaending their relationship.But their family seems to have a change ofplans and she ends up going to the same school.The only thing is, she'sa goody goody girl and the boy she fell in love with is a member of agang.Graese is a fairly entertaining film and even if you don't likemusicals, but like teen films then you should check this one out.
