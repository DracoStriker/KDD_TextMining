Dreadful mish-mash. A musical about sweet, lovable Sandy (OliviaNewton-John) in love with hood Danny Zuko (John Travolta). Tedious andpredictable complications ensure. It all ends up with Sandy deciding tobecome a tramp (she's wearing a skin-tight leather outfit at the end)to get the man she loves. Great message to the girls in America--youcan't get the guy you love by being sweet so be a tramp and you'll gethim.I've never liked this movie. With a few exceptions the actors REALLYoveract to an embarrassing degree. The guys who played the T Birds wereparticularly annoying--they acted like a bunch of hyperactive fourthgraders. The dance numbers (I'm being charitable to call them that) aredisasters. Except for the prom dance they're all over the place.Especially during the "Summer Nights" number--it seems like everybodyis dancing to totally different songs! The script has Mickey Mousedialogue and is chockful of crude stupid jokes (most of which areedited out of the TV prints). There are a few things that save this from total disaster. Newton-Johnis very sweet and pretty as Sandy. Travolta overacts--but in anengaging way. Jeff Conaway as his best buddy is very good. AlsoStockard Channing (who was 30 when she made this) is on target asRizzo. She also gets a chance to belt out her own number "There AreWorse Things I Could Do". Also the songs are great--"Summer Nights","Hopelessly Devoted to You", "You're the One That I Want", "GreasedLightning"... Too bad they're all so ineptly staged. I have seen the movie multiple times--but only as camp. It's somethingI just watch and wonder at. How did something so badly done get to besuch a big hit? Channing herself has openly said she hates the movie.And I find the message this movie gives to be very troubling.I give it a 5 but that's only for the music and some of the acting. Asa movie this rates a 1.
