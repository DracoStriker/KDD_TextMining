Everyone raves about this movie and I just don't know why.  I saw it whenitfirst came out and even after all these years I don't understand theattraction and I'm appalled that schools have productions of thiswretchedwaste of time and money.Does anyone else see what I see in that movie?  The music is "okay" withsome catchy tunes, but has anyone REALLY listed to the lyrics from"GreasedLightning"?  And does anyone else see the message that the film sendsout -that in order to be part of the "in crowd" and popular a "good girl"shoulddress and act like a slut?  And she should chase after a guy who is atotalpunk and doesn't respect her at all?Everyone goes on and on about "Grease" and I see parents take theiradolescent children (especially daughters) to see it or they own it.  Andschools condone it as a production - I just don't get it.
