  I first saw this movie when it was on TV in 1991 when I was seven yearsold. Watching it again 10 years later, this film still has it's magic. Allthe characters in this flick are perfectly cast with each star taking tohis/her role just like a duck to water. The songs are very catchy and it issimply a 70s classic. 9/10
