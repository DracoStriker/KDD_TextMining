Most of the songs in this movie are fun. Olivia Newton John has abeautiful voice. One message of the movie is that the girl should change for the boy butthe boy can stay the same. True, Danny comes out in a letter sweaterbut he still has his tight jeans, greased hair and t shirt. When hesees Sandy looking like a total slut he throws away the sweater. Hedisplays a macho attitude while Sandy has become what he wants her tobe. Sandy was going to postpone sex until after marriage. At the end asthey drive off it is pretty clear that they are going to have sex. I would have preferred it if they had met in the middle. Danny shouldhave kept the sweater on and not had his hair quite so greasy. Sandyshould have been looked much less like a hooker. Perhaps jeans and a tshirt with her hair still in a ponytail. Danny makes some attempts to change during the movie but in the endremains the same. Sandy totally changes her values and the way shedresses, does her hair, and acts to please Danny. The sexist message here is very obvious.Before anyone comments No I would not like the ending to be totallyopposite with Danny changing totally for Sandy. I would like them tomeet somewhere in the middle.
