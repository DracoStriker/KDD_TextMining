I saw this film just the other day, sitting underneath the stars in apark with loads of other people, watching the movie on a big screen.There is absolutely nothing like it in the world to be able to enjoy amovie with others. This film is amazing in the way that it can geteverybody up and dancing; you should have seen and heard our rousingrendition of "You're the One That I Want", it was beautiful. I thinkthat the casting in the film is superb, and the songs are great too.We all know how successful "Grease" has been, it is a movie that hasstood the test of time, and I love it. Sure, some parts do drag on alittle bit, especially, "Hopelessly Devoted to You" which always getson my nerves for some reason, but other than that, it's a great way tospend an evening. Although it does look dated, the story is timelessand will always be used in films. The dance routines, the songs,everything is amazing. My favourite scene has to be the finale, as it'sa really uplifting song and a good old happy ending which makes you goaway with a big smile on your face.
