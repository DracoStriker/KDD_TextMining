Every year I will sit down and watch Grease. And i will never ever gettired of the romantic love, the comedy, and the outstanding songsperformed by the cast.A lot of people today are talking about how good High School Musical isand what a perfect movie it is. But nobody remembers Grease. If you askme, High School Musical is a 21st century copy of Grease.If you want a good movie, than it's Grease. It is not rushed like manymovies, or stretched like others. It tells the story at it's own pace,which is why it is such a good movie.I would recommend this movie to all of you people. Trust me you willnot be disappointed.
