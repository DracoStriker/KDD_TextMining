This film was on TV a few days ago. Great musical, despite cast that looktoo old to be between 16 and 18. The songs (Greased Lightning, SummerNights, Look at me! I'm Sandra D!) are catchy, but not in that cheesy"BARBIE GIRL" sense. Olivia Newton John's singing voice is beautiful,especcially in Hopelessy Devoted to You.ONE BLOOPER: in the song You're the one that I want and Sandy pushes Dannyinto some dust, there is some dust on his top (unsurprisingly). However,seconds later, it's gone!
