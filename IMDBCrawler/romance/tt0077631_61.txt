I saw this movie when it was originally released in the UK and I queuedfor8 hours for what I still consider to be the best movie musical ever.I saw the movie repeatedly over a couple of weeks and with each viewingthefilm grew closer and closer to my heart. There are no bad performances init. There are no bad songs, actors, situations, nothing - it is PERFECT.Travolta and Newton-john couldn't have been better cast, they both lookandsound fantastic. Olivia gives the performance of her life. She fails tomatch up to this movie in anything else, and Travolta went from strengthtostrength (forget "Sing").The supporting cast are perfection with an honourable mention going to themajestic Stockard Channing. When Rizzo sings "There are worst things Icoulddo" I was heartbroken as a child, as a grown man the woman can reduce metotears every time.This is not the best movie of all time - millions of polls world-wide givetestament to that fact. But for me, this film is without question puremagicand will always be my number one.
