I've seen this movie probably over 200 times by now.  I used to watch itevery week when I was at school and even now it's as much fun as it alwayswas.  John Travolta and Olivia Newton John are perfectly cast and theexcellent songs like "Grease", "Hopelessly Devoted to you" and "SummerNights" are extremely well staged and performed.  It's also fun to see againin the cinema since its 1998 re-issue.
