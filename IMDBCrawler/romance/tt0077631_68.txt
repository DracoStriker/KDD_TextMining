Great movie with awesome songs actors and acting. I have loved thismovie for about all my life. It is still one of the best movies. Peopleare still comparing musicals to it. Also people are still talking overit. I think that it has some of the best music that I ever heard. Thesongs were very original and people are still basing movies on themsuch as High school Musical. Also people are still singing the songstill this day. Studios are still putting it on the cable and satellitechannels. Such as ABC Family which is a big hit with most family's anyounger children. In about 10 years it will still be a classic andpeople will still be comparing it to other movies.
