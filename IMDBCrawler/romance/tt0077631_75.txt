This has to be probably one of the only musicals that I enjoy a lot.  JohnTravolta made himself worthy of being called a great actor in this andOlivia Newton John proved the same that she is a great actress.  They canboth sing wonderfully and so can the others.  The songs are very creativeand the writers of this movie must be geniuses.  The whole cast is reallycool.  Stockard Channing did good as the leader of the "Pink Ladies" and allof the other woman in the "ladies" were cool.  All of the other guys in the"T-Birds" were all cool and I enjoyed them.Overall the songs are great and the actors and actresses sure do know how tosing them.  Rating 10 out of 10.
