Love is a many-splendored thing for dimpled stud John Travolta (asDanny) and pretty blonde Olivia Newton-John (as Sandy). They frolic onthe beach for a summer. We later learn it was "all talk and no action."When school starts, we also learn how little they spoke, as Mr.Travolta is surprised to discover Ms. Newton-John is an Australianexchange student attending swingin' Rydell High School. The way thesecharacter look, act and speak suggests Rydell is a "special" school forthose who are having trouble graduating. Best pals Stockard Channing(as Rizzo) and Jeff Conaway (as Kenickie) are a little brainier."Grease" is a moronic adaptation of a stage hit set in the 1950s, madeto sound like the 1970s.Considering the personnel involved in this picture, old-timers offerironic "rules" for the enclosed "dance contest." Eve Arden warns,"Anyone doing tasteless or vulgar movements will be disqualified." Moreimportantly, Sid Caesar notes, "All couples must be boy/girl." So, artdoesn't always imitate life. There are a lot of familiar faces; see whoyou recognize, and why. If you get bored, don't stop until you find thegreat "video" located near the end of the film - the "You're the OneThat I Want" duet performed by Newton-John and Travolta, driven by apulsating bass line, is a terrifically sexy pop fire-starter from 1978.**** Grease (6/13/78) Randal Kleiser ~ John Travolta, OliviaNewton-John, Stockard Channing, Jeff Conaway
