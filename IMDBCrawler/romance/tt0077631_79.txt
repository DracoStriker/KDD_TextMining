A guy and girl fall in love, but then must return home... only to findout they go to the same high school and act completely different whentheir friends are around. With the help of some music and dancing, canthey make cars into speed demons and ladies into sexual creatures? Oh,I think maybe they can...The only reason I should have watched this film was to see LorenzoLamas as Tom Chisum. John Travolta was nothing special, OliviaNewton-John (who the video clerk said would be a guy's dream) wasnothing special (and Australian) and Stockard Channing... oh my! Here's the spoiler: after all the singing and dancing is over, thefemale lead decides that instead of being herself, she is going tostart smoking and wear black leather to be with the man she loves,despite the fact the man she loves was only acting at the time. Themale lead, who was beginning to change, reverts back to his old selfand everyone is happy. Moral: women of the world can only be happy oncethey give up their identity and become a man's shadow. (Ladies, don'tyou think there are other man more like you in the world? Just maybenot at Rydell High.) So yeah, I had to watch this against my will. At least my friend Lisawas nice enough to suffer with me. I know the songs, I don't mind thesongs (especially when done by Less Than Jake), but the film is justtrash and I have no idea how this has become an internationalsensation. Rubbish!
