Who doesn't like fun? Then, there is high school fun which no one canfigure out either in that moment or later but it was fun never theless. Watching this movie brought back memories of just what happenedin American high schools around the 50's and some. We are reminded ofhow much we knew and didn't know and the nagging thought decades laterof how much more we could have done and didn't because we didn't know.The characters bring it all to life imitating what was going on at thattime and making fun of it. The actors had a good time doing this moviemaking the viewers catch the afterglow of it all. Enjoy the songs whichbecome not only memorable but sing-able too. Who hasn't sang at leastone of them? Be honest here! When I heard they were going to do Grease2, I couldn't wait only to watch it and realize that I should havewaited. Very disappointing considering the first one and how high itleft you when it ended. Good snack movie with a tasty drink...Grease isthe word
