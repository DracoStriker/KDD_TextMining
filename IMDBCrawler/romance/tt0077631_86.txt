This is a romantic comedy musical film that was released in 1978, butis set in 1958 in Los Angeles.The film is well-written and well-acted, with good song-and-danceroutines. Its main fault is that many of the high school pupils areplayed by people who were well into their twenties or even theirthirties and don't pass for the 17 or 18-year-olds that they'replaying.
