Starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, this musical from thelate 70s will take you right back to the 50s, when boys were boys,girls were girls and having a car actually meant something. Is itdated? Yes, but in a loving manner.Danny (Travolta) and Sandy (Newton-John) separate after a summerromance, believing that they will probably never see one another again.Then they find out that they're attending the same high school and thatDanny has not been as straightforward about his personality as heprobably should have been. It turns out he's a greaser and while in thepresence of his friends about as misogynistic and old-fashioned as aredneck from 1800s. Yet he still loves Sandy, so what are they to do?This is a fun musical. Both the main leads are unbelievablycharismatic, despite Newton-John being thirty years old - yeah, I findit hard to believe as well - and even Travolta being well over twenty.But they make up for it in chemistry, great song numbers and goodold-fashioned charm. The music is also great. Greased Lightnin', Summer Nights and You'rethe One That I Want defined a whole generation. Sure, not all of them,like Beauty School Dropout, are all that memorable and some, likeSummer Nights, contain somewhat sexist lyrics, but overall the songsare great and the whole film has this energy to it.Grease defines the word fun. It's a high energy blast that is theperfect watch for all teenagers alike. Just remember that it was madein the 70s.
