"Grease" is one of those films that I can watch over and over--and Ido. Set in the doo-wop fifties, it centers on a group of high schoolseniors who share the joys and concerns of all teenagers: dating,popularity, first love, the unknown future, fitting in, sexualawakening.The two main characters, Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (OliviaNewton-John) are the primary love story and the core of a greatensemble cast.One of the best things about this film is the music--a string ofsing-able fifties-inspired gems that entertain and advance thenarrative.There are also plenty of humor, fine dancing, and numerous referencesto fifties culture."Saturday Night Fever" put Travolta on the track to film stardom and"Grease" (released the following year) cemented his place among topcinema stars. Both films were co-produced by Robert Stigwood and theirsoundtracks (On RSO Records)made them huge successes in two genres."Grease" is so dense with cultural references and appearances by50s-era stars, that it takes multiple viewings to appreciate them all.Even Frankie Avalon drops in for a dreamy interlude.
