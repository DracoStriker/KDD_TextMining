I personally love this movie, however I have been told that you have tobe a big fan of musicals to enjoy it. The music is catchy, the dancingis impressive, and the story line is great. Sandy and Danny meet in California over summer break and fall in love.Little did they know that they would be attending the same high schoolwhen going back to school. Both were surprised and excited to see eachother, however they were influenced by there friends at school. It is aquestion throughout the whole film whether or not Danny and Sandy willbe able to regain their love.
