Inspired by and inspiring film successes like Pulp Fiction and manypersons to sing songs at karaoke bars early in the night, expectationswere high. Too high.First, the plot is razor-thin. Boy falls in love with girl, by chancethey end up in the same school and try to get back together. Some othersubplots develop, but they're not much more complicated than the mainstory.Second, the film is almost two hours of noise. There are no silentmoments, and it's irritating. Dialogues follow each other up, and inbetween there's music. Even when the music plays, you are leftwondering why and which background noises, like footsteps, are mixed inthe audio. Third, the visual noise is giving headaches. The screen is alwaysfilled, often with colours that pain the eyes, and often with too manyactors and extras.Fourth, acting is as thin as the plot. Almost no character development.Too many caricatures with no meaning. Humor that resembles too much toslapstick.So why give it five stars? Despite the excess of actors, choreographyis very good. It must have taken a lot of time to put all those actorsand extras in the right order. Also, a look at greaser culture wasinteresting, as well as the car scene in the sewers.If you're into busy, superficial musicals: give it a try. If not, justleave it.
