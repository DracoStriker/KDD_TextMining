THE BEST MUSICAL EVER!I love Grease. It's my favorite movie ever when I need to groove out.All the songs are purely outstanding. The special tunes are 'SummerNights', 'Grease Lightning', 'You're the One That I Want', and'Hopelessly Devoted to You' which might be the best song sung by thestars of the bunch.Olivia Newton-John is a superstar; she's special and she starring inGrease makes Grease special. Olivia is an absolute dreambot. JohnTravolta has special talents; John is such a great dancer and he makesGrease special too.The songs are amazing in Grease creating the best sing along momentsever, and the movie itself is very watchable and such fun. I LOOVVEEEGRRREEEEEAASSEE! I give it a true 10 out of 10 for it is a masterpiece.The national dance off is the best part with Sandy and Danny, unlessthe end is.GREASE ROCKS! FOREVER!
