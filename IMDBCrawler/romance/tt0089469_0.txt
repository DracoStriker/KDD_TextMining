Never did the phrase "a beautiful film" have more relevance than in thiswonderful piece of adult fantasy. Make no mistake, this masterpiece, RidleyScott's fourth film (it followed BLADE RUNNER) was never intended forchildren. Those who have written it off as a kids' movie totally betraytheir limitations and inability to see what is being offeredhere.A youthful Tom Cruise was such a good choice as Jack, the forest dwellerdestined to plunge the world into darkness and then have but one opportunityto restore the light. Mia Sara is the beautiful princess, part Cinderella,part angel, all virgin! and Tim Curry? well, what a simply staggeringcontribution as the Lord of Darkness. Totally unrecognizable both visuallyand audibly but what a performance.All the Ridley Scott trademarks are here, the back-projected blue light, thefiltered scenes of wonderment, central characters in a crisis, the enigma oflife itself. If anything, LEGEND is better now than when it was released. In'85 it received critical praise - just no-one went to see it! Well that'snot strictly true. I attended the Sydney premiere and sat thru it entrancedas others fidgeted, whispered, and generally brought attention to theirlimited attention spans and lowered perceptions! Certainly it is a film that on one level children could relate to and evenenjoy but it is a far deeper film with a host of reflective ideas and quitemagical concepts. What really IS the Lord of Darkness? What is thesignificance of the Unicorns? What becomes of the innocence we leave behindin childhood? If none of this interests you, make sure you avoid thisfilm!
