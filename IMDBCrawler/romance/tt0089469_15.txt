One of Ridley Scott's 1980s films, "Legend" has a lot going for it interms of special effects and performances. The simple fairy-talestoryline sees a brave young elf Jack (Tom Cruise) rescue the beautifulPrincess Lily (Mia Sara) from the vile clutches of Darkness (TimCurry).That's really about it, story-wise, although there's plenty of funalong the way. Some fantastic design gives real life to the forestworld where the film is set, along with the fire and shadows ofDarkness' lair. In his quest Jack meets, befriends and occasionally hasto outwit elves, trolls and sea creatures. It's played pretty low-keymost of the time but it's still good fun.Jack is brought to life well by Tom Cruise. He isn't much of a leadingman presence in this picture (that would come when he made "Top Gun")but he still captures the character and fits in well with the movieenvironment. Mia Sara has the typically thankless role of thedamsel-in-distress, but she acquits herself well in a good scene whereDarkness seduces her. As for Darkness himself, not only does he lookfantastic but he's played with absolute relish by Tim Curry who savoursevery moment. Character actors Billy Barty and Robert Picardo have twovery good supporting turns.A good movie for a night in. Recommended.
