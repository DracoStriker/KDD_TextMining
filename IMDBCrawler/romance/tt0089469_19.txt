Legend is a below average movie.The storyline is promising,but not atall what you'd expect.I am a huge fan of Tom Cruise and I also like alot of movies Ridley Scott made,but I didn't really like this one atall.It was a very early movie for both of them,and its definitely not amovie that Cruise would star in if it was made today.It isn'tnecessarily a long movie but if you're like me you will still get verybored.The movie is rated PG,but it is very dark and creepy and Idefinitely wouldn't recommend you show any child under the age of tenthis movie.Fans of very dark fairy tale and fantasy may enjoyLegend,but anyone who watched this because they like Tom Cruise orRidley Scott movies wont appreciate it.Jack (Tom Cruise) is deeply in love with a woman who is kidnapped bythe Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry,with the only impressive performance inthis movie) to be his wife for eternity,its up to Jack save his truelove.
