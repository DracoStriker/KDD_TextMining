Fantasy movies were rare and poorly done in those days. I was ateenager then, and as a fantasy fan, I can't tell you how many times Iwas disappointed. Take a look at the animated versions of the Lord ofthe Rings, or the Hobbit. Even filmmakers who took fantasy seriouslycontributed to its stigma, because they couldn't get a few bucks to doa movie right. Now the grand success of 'Rings'and 'Harry Potter' haschanged everything, Hollywood is throwing billions at fantasy movies...and still missing the point. Hollywood, for all its glamor andcontroversy, will never change. Tom Cruise' aforementioned apathytowards this film is testament to that fact. He started out in thebusiness doing a movie that was phenomenal in the genre and a trueclassic, as time has shown. But he regrets it? That's because Tom ISHollywood. In fact, I suspect that as 'Rings' was peaking, Cruise wasstarting to think Legend may not have been all that bad. But after afew more 'Eragon' style flicks, the stigma will be safely back inplace, and fantasy can go crawling back into its closet, tail tuckedfirmly between legs. And fantasy fans can follow, with their novels byTolkien, Lewis, and Howard safely hidden in their backpacks. ThanksHollywood.
