This is easily the worst film ever written, proving that good actors, agreat director, and a decent score can't cover up a truly pathetic script. The plot of the film is a poorly disguised redux of "The Lord of the Rings"-- Dark Lords, innocent heros, mystical powers bound up in unlikely objects-- and could not possibly have been conceived by anyone over the age ofsix.In fact, judging by the excruciatingly painful dialogue, a six-year-old mayindeed have written the script.  The only reason my wife and I continued towatch was because of the macabre curiosity that grips anyone watching adisaster, and watching this film was about akin to watching a slow trainwreck, surgery gone wrong, Adam and Eve eating the Fruit, or the slowplummet of a crippled airliner.  It was that bad.  This film is worse than most which have gained infamy -- think of "IcePirates" or "Mac and Me", but then think of having your nails pulled outwhile watching them.  It's on that level.  The opening scroll gives you aclue as to just how painful the film will be, and it just gets worse whenpeople actually appear on the screen.  Without a doubt, this film had abright future behind it.However, for those who loved "Plan Nine From Outer Space", "Mars Attacks!",and "The Scorpion King", this movie might just provide you with a moment ofdistraction.  For anyone seeking a top-notch fantasy film, go rent "Conanthe Barbarian" or "Lord of the Rings"; you could even get a better viewingexperience out of "Krull", "DragonSlayer", and "Dungeons and Dragons".  Asfor "Legend", the only thing legendary about it is the amount of money andcelluloid they wasted making it.
