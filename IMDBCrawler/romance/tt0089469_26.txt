Just to clarify here, I'm talking about the director's cut, not theoriginal American release. I'm not going to get in to the wholeargument over which is better.This film contains some of the most stunning imagery I've ever seen.Some of the shots are art pieces in their own right and are capable ofstanding apart from the film. An example is the shot followingDarkness' entrance through the mirror, when he bends down and his cloaktwists out behind him. Pure magic.Ridley Scott and his crew built an entire indoor forest complete withreal birds to make this film come to life. He puts an extraordinaryamount of thought and planning behind the visual design and each of hisshots which is the reason they look so amazing. The design of Darkness'character, especially the prosthetics and make up, is truly great. PoorTim Curry must've sat in that make up chair for hours!Don't get me wrong, the film has flaws. The script isn't perfect andcomes across a little cheesy in parts. However there are also somegreat moments (the scene between Lily and Darkness in his lair comes tomind). The design is definitely the strong point of the film though,and who can resist a film so dedicated to exploring the strugglebetween good and evil, with a few unicorns mixed in to keep the kiddieshappy of course. Basically, it's pure fantasy in it's most selfindulgent form.
