Legend is one of those movies you either love or hate . It's a fantasy moviebut it doesn't really contain a whole lot of action which is probably whymany people are turned off by it . But the film is visually stunning andfeatures a good performance by Tim Curry as "Darkness" , Tom Cruise on theother hand looks a bit confused throughout the movie . Also Rob Bottin'sMake up is just amazing .Now things weren't helped by the fact that there are so many versions ofthis movie and some are vastly better than others . The weakest and shortestof the all is the US theatrical cut because it misses many scenes and ads afew that seem tacked on but worst of all it contains a score by TangerineDream instead of the original one by Jerry Goldsmith .The European cut is better in that it is longer and it features JerryGoldsmith's score .The best version however is the Director's Cut featured on The UltimateEdition DVD . It runs alot longer than any of the other cuts and it is themost coherent cut as well and it features the score by Jerry Goldsmith.
