I finally got to see Legend in its entirety from start to finish in onesitting. Previously I had only seen bits and pieces. Sad to say this isa film whose parts are greater than the whole.Technically it's a stunning masterpiece. I don't think there was a filmlike this since Paramount took most of it's players in 1933 and putthem all in makeup for its version of Alice in Wonderland. In fact theonly two in the film who go without any make up because they're theonly humans in the film are woodsman Tom Cruise and princess Mia Sara.Tom looks a little lost in this part. Fantasy certainly is something henever tried again in his career. Probably he was wise not to. Mia Saracomes off a bit like a spoiled Jewish American Princess. If her dad theking was around, she'd have just ordered him to buy her those unicorns.However the rest of the cast looks like they're having a grand oldtime. Especially Tim Curry who steals the film. He overacts with relishhis role of the Lord of Darkness, he's the main reason to see Legend.Legend is photographed well and the makeup is in a class by itself. Whyit didn't win an Oscar in the only category Legend was nominated in, isbeyond me. Still it's a film best consigned to the juvenile audience.
