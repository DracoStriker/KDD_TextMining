I subjected myself to a viewing of the "Director's Cut" of Legendtonight. How I wish there were a MST3K version of it, because if therewas ever a film deserving a skewering, this is it.Costuming in many cases looks laughably, muppet-like, and cheap. Tim Curry is the movie's only saving grace, but turn the sound off toavoid regurgitating at the campy, laughable dialog... "I offer you thisrose, my princess..."I love the hubcap assembly-line to bring light to darkness. Laugh outloud funny.Much has been said about the rich set design/cinematography.Right.....if you get weepy and moved by this, you probably were alsoweepy playing with your "My Little Pony." This movie looks like VANpaintings. C H E E S Y.
