so that this utterly horrid movie would end faster!! I had to watch thisonmy sister's birthday as it was her "birthday movie". Never before had I sohoped the bad guy would hurry up and kill the good guy so I could get outofthe theater! Luckily for Cruise this stinker was bookended by two reallygood movies or his career may have flamed out.Most of the other actors did a decent job, but I think the story was justhorrible. Hard to create a diamond out of pig s**t, and they reallyshouldn't have tried. I know it sounds like I'm being really harsh, butwatch the movie and you'll understand what I'm saying. It really ispainfulto watch!
