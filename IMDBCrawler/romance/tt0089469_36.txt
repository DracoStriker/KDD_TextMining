First of all, I must admit that I haven't seen the much longerdirector's cut with Jerry Goldsmith's original score, but I willdefinitely check that one out and perhaps come back to re-evaluateLegend. The director's cut of Blade Runner completely shifted myopinion about that movie, and I see a lot of potential here, as well.(Moreover, the extended cuts of both Kingdom of Heaven and Gladiatorare also better than their respective theatrical versions, and havingseen what he cut out of Prometheus, it is safe to say that it's alwaysworth giving a chance to the outtakes and long versions of RidleyScott's movies.)Legend is a gorgeously designed and photographed dark fairy-tale, butunfortunately the theatrical version gradually sinks into boredom andfalls to pieces by the end. The beginning, however, is stunninglybeautiful. Thirty years later, the visuals are still jaw-dropping andfor that alone, the film is definitely worth a watch. No other fantasyfilm has such a dreamlike quality that carries the sense of fairy-talemagic.Ridley Scott's fourth feature film could have been his fourth classicin a row ? or is it? It all depends on the additional 30 minutes I haveyet to see.
