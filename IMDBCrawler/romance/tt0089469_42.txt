In my opinion the director's cut of Ridley Scott's masterpiece, Legend,holds up with every single CGI fantasy epic(including The Lord of TheRings)released recently. It saddens me that this version did not makeit into theaters. With the exception of the ending(the whole "It wasall a dream" feel)Legend was a brilliantly imagined fairy tale. Whilethe original theatrical release was good(as was Tangerine Dream'sscore)I thought it was marginal compared to the intended version.Ridley Scott is such a masterful director. I cannot explain it exceptto say that whenever I watch a Ridley film I BELIEVE in everythingpresented before me. I truly believed that a world like the one inLEGEND could have actually existed. Whilst viewing the movie I feltimmersed in the story and the forest itself. The production team tookso much time and care in cultivating that forest. And don't even get mestarted on the make up and acting. Today's Hollywood should rely lesson CGI and get back to men in suits and make-up. I cannot wrap my brainaround the fact that "Darkness" is none other than Tim Curry from "TheRock Horror Picture Show." As a fantasy film fan I rank this as one ofthe finest. I am just saddened that the powers that be in Hollywood didnot give American Cinema goers the benefit of the doubt. The moviecould have been more successful had it been told in its originalformat(sans the ending)...
