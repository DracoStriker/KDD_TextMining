I just watched the director's cut on DVD.  The film is very good.  We havetop notch set design, costumes and even acting.  The only fault of thefilmis perhaps the story--I wanted more.  It is a fantasy film after all, soweshould have seen tons of loose ends for us to fantasize about.  Oh well.The visual experience makes up for it...Don't ruin the film by EVER watching the theatrical release, however.(Thehistory on how the film was butchered on the way to the big screen is veryinteresting.)Overall, worth seeing.
