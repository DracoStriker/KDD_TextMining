I just bought the directors cut last night!  It is so spectacular --although I am so used to the Tangerine Dream score that the alternate onewas a vague disappointment.  Oh it didn't disturb me -- the music itself. It was when music was MISSING ALTOGETHER for certain parts of the moviewhere the Tangerine Dream score added to the atmosphere was thedisappointment.  The only REAL disappointment in the original score was thedifference between the scores in the "Dancing Dress" Scene.  That wasIT!!!!!Out of the different movie openings, I like the "Mother Night" Monologue farmore than Tim's other monologue.  Yet that's about all that's reallydifferent.  Blix sounds different in it too so it's odd and throws you off,but not big time.  The part that I really liked was where -- in thedirectors cut -- Lily asks Jack to teach her Rabbit.  She seems so ... Idon't know the word of it!  But it's a great deal of fun!  She's justsnappy!  At least her voice is.  I can't believe she's onlyfifteen.If you have the chance to see the directors cut, I think it would be anintense experience for the fans out there.  This movie kicks butt no matterwhich version you look at.  Give it a try!!!!
