Ridley Scott tried his best to cover every outcast genre he could andLegendwas his Fantasy. Scott has said that he encountered the same problems withthis film that he did with Blade Runner:his cut wasn't connecting withpeople. The "general" audience wasn't getting it. So it was recut, a newscore by Tangerine Dream was added, and it was released. A great movie forall people, the theatrical release was all I could've asked for. Until Isawthe  newly realeased director's cut, that is. If you're a "generalaudience"kind of person, you will love the theatrical cut. If you loved thedirector's cut of Blade Runner, and you're looking for a little more in afilm, check out the new release cut. Both are worth youtime.Heather
