Just recently Legend was released in the Ultimate Edition, a 2 disc set ofDVDs.  This includes both the original US Release and Ridley Scott'sDirector's Cut.  Some people I know, bit 80's fan I might also say, reallyloved the original US release, but to me at least the tone of the movieisn't set properly, especially in the music. With 24 more minutes of added scenes and a completely new score for themovie, the Director's Cut brings out Legend as the amazing fantasy it wasdesigned to be.  The movie has absolutely amazing cinematography to bringthe wonderful scenes to life.  Just the first scene of the forest just leftme saying "wow". All and all, if you thought the original release came off a little cornyand didn't quite feel right, give the Director's Cut a chance.  If you areone of those in love with the original release, pretend the Director's Cutnever existed :) Beautifully filmed fantasy adventure, check it out.
