I've always had a fondness for this movie, even though it has a verypedestrian plot and underdeveloped characters.  There are just so manymemorable and striking images and a great Tangerine Dream score to make itajoy to watch.  Having said this and having just watched the Director's cutof the film with the original Jerry Goldsmith score, I must say I enjoyLegend even more now.  In comparison, the U.S. theatrical version nowseemsa bit weak to say the least.  Almost every scene is fleshed out more intheDirector's cut and the movie is paced so much better because of this andtheGoldsmith score makes the film have a more epic feel to it.  In watchingLegend again recently, I couldn't help but make comparisons to Lord Of TheRings which I saw this past year and it surprised me how well Legend holdsup visually to LOTR, even though it was made at least 15 years previous toit!  It just shows what a master artist Ridley Scott is with regards tohisdirection and vision.  Bravo!
