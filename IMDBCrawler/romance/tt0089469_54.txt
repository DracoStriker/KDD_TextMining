The new Legend DVD, which features not only the US version (which is the onethat everybody has voted for here), but the extended Director's Cut (whichfeatures half an hour of new footage as well as Jerry Goldsmith's originalscore) which is far superior and really makes Legend a different, bettermovie.  The Director's Cut offers more insight into the characters, and adarker perspective on the events of the film.  It was almost like watchingLord of the Rings, which this film reminds me of greatly.  The new cut isreally great, and much more deserving than a mere 6.0 rating.  I hope IMDBmakes a new page for the Director's Cut so that people will know there ismore than one, like with Blade Runner.
