I thought the movie was provocative.  It really brought out the evilversusgood aspect.  Darkness was sooo scary that I was terrified as a kid.  Theaccent blended in well with the makeup effects.  Overall the makeupeffectswere ahead of its time, and brought out all the great categories thismoviehas to offer. The lighting was also very great.  I really recommend thismovie if you are a fan of the devil!!!! haha.
