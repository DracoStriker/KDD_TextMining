I don't think this film is very good.  It is dogged by cheesy,over-sentimental fantasy that tthe Americans excel in (even though it's aBritish film), and all those pixie things are really quite ugly.  But Iwould buy this film if I saw it at a car-boot sale, for one reason.  Thecharacter Darkness.  Played by Tim Curry, he is the finest example ofmake-up transformation I think I've ever witnessed.  He looks like he'swandered out of Hell and straight onto the set.  Those reptile eyes,over-sized horns, hairy arms and legs, cloven feet, blood-red skin.  Run infear, Tim Curry is here!  Otherwise, this is tosh.
