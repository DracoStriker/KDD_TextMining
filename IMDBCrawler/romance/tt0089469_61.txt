This movie is a pure example of Ridley Scotts talent at making a beautifulfilm. Although this movie didn't do too good, its cinematography is some ofthe best.  It also stars Tom Cruise as a young forest boy who's love,Princess Lily, is kidnapped by a sinister devil-like character played by TimCurrie.  One of the best fantasy movies around.
