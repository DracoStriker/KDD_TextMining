This is the best example of pure fantasy brought to the screen.  The moviepervades with Ridley Scott's characteristic darkness, and is replete withhis unique style and creativity.  The young Tom Cruise is his usual self,but Tim Curry is wonderful as darkness, clad in an excellent representationof darkness.
