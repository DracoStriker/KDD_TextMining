This fairly standard sword and sorcery tale stars Tom Cruise (who wasjust as boring before rising to super-stardom) as Jack a peasant boywho falls in love with the beautiful Princess Lily (wondefully playedby Mia Sara). The crux of the story is that the Lord of the Darkness(Tim Curry) has captured one of the two magical unicorns that keep thesun shining and has plans to marry the Princess so he can rule theworld. Along with a fairy, an elf and two dwarfs, Jack takes it uponhimself to stop Darkness and restore order. As one might guess,the story is not only standard but also muddled andnot particularly exciting but this is just a gravy complaint when onelooks at the film more broadly. The make-up, production design andspecial effects are simply breath taking and Tim Curry delivers thebest performance of his career (sorry Rocky Horror fans) as the Lord ofDarkness. With the sole exception of Cruise, the entire cast which alsoincludes Billy Barty, Robert Picardo and Alice Playton deliver someterrific performances.As an example of the film's beautiful make-up, I must admit I'm stillshocked that Robert Picardo, AKA The Doctor from "Star Trek", is theone playing Meg Mucklebones. the same goes for Tim Curry who is flatout unrecognizable as Darkness.With all due respect to Jerry Goldsmith, I prefer the American scorewith Tangerine Dream and Bryan Ferry as their score and ending songsprovides a rousing finale to this amazing film. All in all, check out Legend. You won't be sorry.
