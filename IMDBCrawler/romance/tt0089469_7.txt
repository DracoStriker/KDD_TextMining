Legend...I can only say that this film, at least the European version, succeeds intothe creation of a fantasy world that very very few other films have. AndNEVER has a fairytale forest been realised so vividly and fantastically ashere. The production design at Pinewood Studios is trulyoutstanding.Of course, this film was a considerable flop. And looking at it, it isn'ttoo hard to see why. A film that retains some semblance of morality - inthis case the most basic, good versus evil - will not play to youngaudiences of the late 20th century. The tone of the film is perhaps too darkfor young children, the overall theme of the film perhaps too juvenile formost adults. And so Legend finds itself in a cinematic limbo, a placewithout a core audience.Of course, a cult audience has evolved around this film as it does aroundanything that misses its major target, and so Legend is a film that iseither loved or loathed. Either way, Ridley Scott's stunning visualimaginings are realised with undeniable skill.In addition to Scott's and his team's visual successes, this film - at leastfor European viewers - is embellished with one of the most beautiful scoresever written. Jerry Goldsmith has, during his transition from traditional tosynthesied orchestra, created one of the richest scores ever bestowed on afilm.Quite what Warner Bros thought they were doing when they removed this scoreand cut chunks out of the film (and re-edited what was left) I will neverunderstand. The film would and did flop in both versions, but that doesn'tnecessarily mean it shouldn't have been made.If you are knew to this film, do yourself a favour and never watch theAmerican version, unless it is the revamped widescreen version with theGoldsmith score back in place.A visual dream, a beautiful score, a moral tale. Is there any wonder itflopped?
