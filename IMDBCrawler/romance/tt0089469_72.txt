"Legend" is a legend of film-making because, similar to films by OrsonWelles and Sergio Leone, it was assaulted by editors against thedirector's wishes and transformed into an entirely other picture. Thedifference between Ridley Scott's "Legend" and the other directors'films is that both versions of Scott's films are poorly made.The theatrical version released in America dropped the Jerry Goldsmithsoundtrack and was cut from 150 minutes to about 90 minutes, andGoldsmith's symphony score was replaced with Tangerine Dream and JonAnderson (of Yes) on vocals. Tangerine Dream fits the film's fantasystoryline and brooding cinematography - if you've heard their music,you'll already know why.The film as a whole is rather unspectacular, though. Tom Cruise playsJack, a commoner who has to embark on a quest to defeat the Dark Lord(Tim Curry), who plans on destroying the last of the Unicorns andunleashing infinite darkness on the world, as well as marrying Jack'sgirlfriend.Watching Tom Cruise run around in leotards for two hours isn't exactlymy idea of a fun movie. Over the years "Legend" has achieved a cultstatus (thanks partly to its numerous edits) but I've found myselfequally underwhelmed by both the American version and the director'scut.
