alright, i didn't choose to see this movie, my girlfriend wanted me towatch it because she really liked it as a kid. but within 10 minutesinto the movie, i was wishing i was doing something else. anythingelse. the movie is slow paced, the acting is terrible, and the climaxis not worth it. spoiler: good beats evil in the end of this heapingpile of stinky goo they call legend. but in my opinion, if good hadreally won out, this little baby would never have seen the light ofday. that being said, if you find yourself about to watch this one, irecommend you go out and watch manos: the hands of fate, or maybe plan9 from outer space. i found both to be much better than this one.
