Legend is fun to look at but a chore to sit through. I wonder if I watch itagain with the sound muted I might like it better. The visuals in the filmare stunning. Ridley Scott has always been a director who focuses ondazzling imagery, and this is no exception. The way he paints the forestsaround Mia Sara and the unicorns is sensational, and we soon wish we werethere, prancing along in the trees and rivers. Alas, there is one thing thatruins it, and that is the story. The story is a clunky, disjointed mess thatmakes us turn away just when we are getting interested. It involves a youngkid who must rescue his lover and a unicorn horn from the demon Darkness, orelse light will be obliterated forever. This is a good setup, butunfortunately the movie goes nowhere, and provides us with so manyuninteresting characters that we stop caring about anything. Tom Cruise'slittle friends, especially the little boy/pixie thing are the worst thingsin the film, and we root for them to come to harm somehow.Tim Curry has the best role in the film as Darkness. He makes the most outof a thankless role, where he is stuck under pounds of makeup and is barelyrecognizable. Curry is sinister and charming at the same time, and you kindof like the guy even though he is kinda evil. Which brings up another point.It's always a bad sign in a movie when the villains are more appealing thanthe heroes. Shouldn't we be rooting for the good guys? Why do they give uspixies that we hate so much, then make the villain a badass?If this film had had a better story it could have been great. I'd watch itagain just to see the brilliant imagery. Ridley Scott made Blade Runner, afilm in which the visuals were more prominent than the story. But what madethat film great was that, even though the story was secondary, it was stillinteresting and it still supported the film. In Legend the story sucks, sothe visuals are all alone.
