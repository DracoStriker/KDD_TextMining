Legend (1985)Plot In A Paragraph: Darkness (Tim Curry) plans to plunge a strangeland into eternal night, by killing every unicorn in the world. Jack(Cruise) and his friends will do everything to save the world andprincess Lilly (Mia Sara) who Darkness intends to make his wife fromthe hands of the evil monster.After releasing 4 movies in 1983, Cruise signed up for a big budgetfantasy movie directed by Ridley Scott which wasn't released in theUnited States until 1986.Legend fails on just about every level for me. It just does not work.OK the sets are well done and I bet it looked great on the big screenback in 1985. Its no surprise gives director Ridley Scott is aperfectionist, who often goes to great leangths to make sure thingslook just right. But I'm not sure the movie knows what it wants to be.It plays like a Childs fairytale, but is just too dull and dreary tohold your attention. We have the great Tim Curry, under so much make up he could be playedby anyone. Likewise our hero Jack, this is the dullest performance fromCruise so far. The charisma and personality he showed it his lastmovies is absent here. Mia Sara (whom I love in Ferris Bueller) isbland beyond belief.I didn't really care about anything that was happening in this movie,and it's a safe bet I'll probably never watch it again. Legend tanked at the box office grossing only $15 million at thedomestic box office, on a budget of approx $24 million, to end the yearthe 56th highest grossing movie of 1986. Cruise disliked this movie so much, he often refused to talk about itfor years. I doubt this movies failure bothered Cruise for long though,as a month after this opened, he was soaring to the top of the boxoffice.
