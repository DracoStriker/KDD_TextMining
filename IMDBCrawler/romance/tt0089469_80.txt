This was my favorite fantasy movie as a child, and has continued tostay with me through out my years. This movie is actually not that wellknown despite the fact that this is a Ridley Scott film. The practicaleffects are stunning especially considering this movie was released in1985! Nearly Thirty years after it's making I am still amazed with TimCurry as Darkness. This film allows you to enter a magical world filledwith Demons, Elves, Fairies and Unicorns and watch a short battlebetween good and evil. This film is easily enjoyed by the entire familyand should be in everyone's library. If you have never watch Legendbefore, then you really are missing what I believe to be a timelessclassic!
