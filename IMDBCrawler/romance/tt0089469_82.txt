Legend has a good fantasy story to tell about the mystical creaturescalled unicorns. I will not say anymore about the unicorns because itwould ruin the film for the first time viewer. I will say they arebeautiful and realistic looking in this movie.I really loved the story as well as the costumes, sets and overalllook/feel to the film - it is quite a magical cinema. The creatures inthe film are great looking - some extremely creepy in appearance.There are two highly trivial things I did not like about the film: 1)The voices of some of the creatures sounded to much alike. It was likethese similar sounding characters had high pitched voices as if theywere sucking on a helium balloon then speaking (examples: Gump andBlix). That really bothered me - it's a trivial complaint I know but itdid get on my nerves for some reason.2) The other minor thing about the film I became irritated with was therelationship between Blix, Blunder and Pox - they were to much like"The Three Stooges" for me instead of being as terrifying as they look.My complaints are extremely minor about the film - I will tell yououtside of my two trivial gripes the movie is good.7.5/10
