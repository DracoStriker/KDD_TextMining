Although this is going to sound like a negative criticism, it's notreally meant to be. (Crom knows, I've already had half a dozen commentsdeleted from the IMDb...) LEGEND is the fourth and (as far as I'mconcerned) final Great Film from director Ridley Scott. Sure, there aresome okay movies scattered here and there throughout his filmographyfrom this point on, but no more truly GREAT movies are to be found.Besides the airtight direction, it's the stunning MANIMATION of theFantasy Characters that makes LEGEND a Classic: the head-to-toe makeupsMAKE the movie. Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen used stop-motionanimation to give Life to their Creatures, but here we have Manimation-Creatures brought to Life, from head to toe, by Monsterwear to rivalTHE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and GODZILLA to ALIEN and PREDATORand everything that's come down the pike since (the Monster in JohnCarpenter's second episode of MASTERS OF HORROR, "PRO-LIFE," certainlygives most Monsterwear a run for their money). Tim Curry takes tophonors as The Lord of Darkness, but Robert Picardo as Meg Mucklebonesis just as impressive in his/her own right- and let us not forget Blixand all the rest. Rob Bottin hit it out of the ball park on this one.
