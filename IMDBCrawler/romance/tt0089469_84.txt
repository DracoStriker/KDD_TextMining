(64%) One of the most terrifying family movies of all time that Iremember had a VHS cover (of the bog witch) that really wouldn't be outof place with an 18 certificate in its corner next to "Nightmare on Elmstreet 2" and "From beyond" in the hallowed horror section of a videorental shop. The make-up and practical effects in this movie are trulysublime, Tim Curry as the devil is jaw dropping, and the dream like setdesign is really quite magical, you can see why and how it inspired theZelda video games. Some of the characters do come off as a littleannoying at times, but I still consider this to be one of the moreunderrated fantasy movies ever.
