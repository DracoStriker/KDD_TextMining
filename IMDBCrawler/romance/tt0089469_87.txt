Jack pursues his abducted love Princess Lily into the kingdom of theLord of Darkness, who has plans to bring darkness and winter tocreation via a stolen unicorn horn.Legend appears to be the forgotten movie from both Tom Cruise's andRidley Scott's CVs. This is a little unfair on Cruise because he isquite good in an early hero role. As for Scott - well, for me, thistypifies his work. Right from the start of his career he has been agenius at bringing to the screen impossible worlds. Alien, BladeRunner, Legend - all look absolutely authentic. And the other aspectwhich Legend typifies - poor storytelling (where, I realise, I am goingagainst the accepted wisdom). I think Scott has problems with clarityof narrative and pacing, and Legend suffers from both of these.A shame - the visuals are great, the cast is fine, and Tim Curry isoutstanding in the best makeup ever.
