LEGENDWell... I had never seen this before, but I must say that everyone wholoves 80s movies should see this. It is so much fun.The movie is about the Devil taking away the daylight and controllingthe planet by killing the innocence of the last 2 unicorns alive.I love fantasy films and I love 80's movies... so this is great for me.The action is classic 80's and the make-up and effects also feel niceand retro. The feel of the whole film is brilliant.I mean the effects were not brilliant compared to todays effects, butfor a fantasy film they were great. It kind of had the same feel as TheNever Ending Story... another classic film. Every now and then you cansee the strings helping the fairies fly. But the make-up was great. Thegoblins, Devil, fairies etc all looked amazing. I always wished I waspart of a world like that. The action and adventure is just such fun.The acting was quite good really considering it's age. The movie starsa very young Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry and Billy Barty. I couldnever imagine Tom Cruise in a movie like this... but he actually suitsit quite well. He did a good job. He made this just before Top Gun. MiaSara also did a good job as the princess. This was her first moviebefore she appeared in a few other well known films. But Tim Curry isthe star of the movie. Tim really is a legend. I love him in a lot ofthe movies he has made. And this is another one to add to the list ofgreat performances.This film is great escapism which is the reason I love movies somuch... it is the perfect way to forget all the worries in your lifeand escape into someone else's adventure.I will give this film 8 out of 10.Another classic film from the 80's."May be innocent, may be sweet... ain't half as nice as rotting meat."For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie-Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl
