As a huge fan of Tangerine Dream and Jon Anderson, I praise the factthat their music is in the "American" cut of this film; their music hasalways sounded like they were trying to do soundtracks to a movie. Youhear a song, you get visual images in your head and make a movie ofyour own.However, ...I do have to say that the American Version with Tangerine Dream'ssoundtrack only makes this movie into a "Cult" film. It could have beengreat, but (well, you fill in the blank).Fortunately, I've seen the way it was SUPPOSED to have been released inthe States (which you can find on the 2-disc DVD, which has bothversions).The Non-American version has a story which is much fuller, and themusic (with a full symphony orchestra) is much better and adds moredrama and punctuates the mood of each scene more properly.I do find the American version's end much more climatic musically andstory-wise with Jon Anderson (singer of Yes)'s angelic voice thunderingwith Tangerine Dream's score in the background.So, pick an afternoon when you got about 4 hours to spare and watchBOTH. Then, take parts of each version and make YOUR OWN wonderousstory.And another thing, keep in mind that this movie came out a whole 20years ago. The early 80's. Next year it can buy it's own beer (if itwas a person). So, Tim Curry and a lot of others would have been justvoices over CGI characters instead of being in actual makeup and therewould have been MORE to the story and script if CGI was as availableback then as it is now.There IS such a thing as knowing limitations, you know.American Version, good enough to make one wonder what was more.International Version, done much better and fuller (though I like theAmerican ending better)As I said, watch both versions and make your OWN version to enjoy.Aaaaannnd ... CUT!That's a wrap.
