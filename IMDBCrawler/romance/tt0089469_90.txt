I personally feel that the film contains only a rather shallow,stereo-typical, and one-dimensional exploration of its major themes ofgood vs. evil, loss of innocence, and so on. In fact, much of the filmfeels stereotypical--strange forest boy; silly & naive girl who doessomething seemingly perfectly harmless and then gets blamed for ruiningeverything (and who does an awful lot of crying out for Jack and seemsunable to actually take care of herself very well..); and then the packof fantasy stock characters that almost randomly appear, with littlepurpose other than spurring the other characters and moving the filmalong. The character development is quite poor, we never really seeinto their deeper motivations; and the opportunities to explorequestions regarding the deeper nature of evil and innocence, lust,greed, hate, love, and desire are left void--the film brings thesethings up, only to leave them sitting there at surface level; there isso much here that could have been explored, since it really is not ablack-and-white or simple issue, but the film treats these things verysimply as just that--a very shallow exploration. A deep explorationcould have really been the wind in the sails for this rather standardplot, and really made the film shine; but from a film whose wholepremise is based on these struggles, I was definitely expecting a bitmore; unfortunately, the treatment falls short of the film's loftythemes and visual imagery.The acting itself was good, and the actors seem well cast, even if thecharacters were rather shallow and stereotyped. The special effectswere pretty good (perhaps almost even overdone) and the photography wasalso good, if a bit dark and dim (in many scenes) for my taste. It'sthe very beautiful fairy-tale landscapes and the unicorns that reallyshine in this film. I give this film a 6 out of 10 for it's decentcharacter portrayal (the actors do a good job with what they're given)and memorable imagery.
