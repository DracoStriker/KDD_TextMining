Legend is the story of Jack, who must prevent the world from being torninto darkness with no return where the wicked rule, and also mustprevent the Lord of Darkness from marrying a princess named Lily, thewoman whom Jack loves. Jack gains help from characters like Gump, Blix,Screwball, Brown Tom and Oona. They team up and try to save the onelast unicorn from which the Lord of Darkness will rule the universe ifhe obtains it. Let me start by saying, I only watched it because of Ridley Scott. He'sa great director and he does very well in this too. That's the onlyreason. Not because the premise intrigued me, or because of any actors,nothing. Just because of Ridley. And I must say, I actually kind ofenjoyed it. It's short, Tom Cruise and the rest are decent in it, it looked reallywell for the time and it was well directed. Granted, there was a lot ofstupid things in it but I didn't mind them because, after all, it is aPG film and it was made in 80's. If you're looking to watch every Ridley film, you might enjoy watchingthis. It's not for everyone and so I wouldn't recommend it to anyoneunless they're like me. But I assure you, it's not terrible. It'spretty decent and I actually was surprised at how much I enjoyed it,especially from the start I was thinking "Oh no, it's this sort offilm." But yeah, it's pretty decent.
