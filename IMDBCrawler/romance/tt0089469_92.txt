After a unicorn is killed darkness falls across the land and a forestboy named Jack must save the world and his love before last ray ofsunlight disappears forever.1985's Legend is simple fantasy tale of good versus evil that unusuallyleaves room for interpretation. Debatably it lacks any likablecharacters which is possibly the reason why Labyrinth (1986) and ThePrincess Bride (1987) fair better in comparison. Tom Cruise, Mia Saraand co are surprisingly subdued and William Hjortsberg's screenplay ismissing the required attention-grabbing dialogue and a sense of journeyand adventure. That said, what legend does have is atmosphere, andabundance of it. Many of the visuals in Legend are far superior to theaforementioned and there is no doubt this is due to Ridley Scott'shandling of the production.Tim Curry's brief performance and make up design as Darkness isfantastic, as to is the makeup as a whole. A notable cast also includeBilly Barty (Masters of the Universe) and Kiran Shah (The Chronicles ofNarnia). Alice Playten's Blix is sorely underused, Annabelle Lanyon isthe peculiar fairy Oona and David Bennent is excellent as the eerieelf-like Gump.The sets are wonderfully constructed this coupled with lighting createa enchanting environment. The Meg Mucklebones is segment is trulycreepy reminiscent of the witches featuring in Clash of the Titans(1981). Jerry Goldsmith's score (reintroduced in the director's cut)gives the film a timeless feel and underpins the mystical element.Ultimately despite being magnificently crafted it's a fantasy that istoo straightforward and underdeveloped for adults and too scary forchildren.
