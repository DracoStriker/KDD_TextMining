I liked this movie for the fantasy aspect. Tom Cruise's role may not bememorable, but the "Dark Lord" has to have the best makeup of any largedemon like creature of any movie I have seen to date (which are a lot). Iamnot a big horror movie watcher so maybe that has limited my exposure todemons, but I don't fell that is my loss. Give it a look at and post youropinions on the flick.
