Absolute cheese on a stick, but Top Gun proves that that's not always abadthing. This movie's got everything - an arrogant prodigy who'd be out onhisarse if he wasn't so good, a sensible, uglier best friend, a love interest(although she's a bit of a mess), an arch nemesis and his dumb sidekick, afew cool high fives and catchphrases, an emotional death scene, a euphoricvictory scene and of course, some unforgettable action scenes. What morecould any red-blooded child of the eighties ask for!? And anyone bornaround1980 will remember how everyone was doing that double high five and saying'talk to me, goose' to the kid next to them in class. Certainly one of myall time favourites.
