Top Gun is a big piece of 1980s cheese. Definitely a Hollywood product,it was however very successful at the box office. The success is mostlydue to the action and to Tom Cruise and his winning smile. The aerialcombat shown in Top Gun is exciting, but it's not always logical orconsistent (shooting down Soviet fighter planes would result in war inreal life). What makes it better is the film's soundtrack. Catchyupbeat rock & pop songs back the action and the romance on screen.That's pretty much the film's appeal. There are plenty of faults, butin the end it's entertaining and makes one feel good. The fighter pilotlife seems so appealing in Top Gun that registrations to join the navyin the USA went up significantly after the film was released. Accordingto the film in order to become one of the top fighter pilots in Americayou have to be a) a male b) have an attitude c) be good-looking d) be agood fighter pilot. Oh, and you have to believe that America is alwayson the side of good. Come to think of it, was there even a brunette inthe film? It seemed to me like all the women were blondes. Yeah, but atleast the dogfights are some of the best in film history. There's noTop Gun program in reality though. Still, while you're there "playingwith the boys" you feel cool and like you belong. Val Kilmer makes animpression, but it turns out he didn't want to be in the film. He hadto play the role of Tom "Iceman" Kazansky because of contractobligations. Top Gun is not a bad film. Even if everything in it is bythe numbers it's still a notable 1980s flick (in my opinion "Take MyBreath Away" is an annoying and corny song). The film is bright, it'saction-packed, it's sometimes touching, it's at times funny. Irecommend it.
