Jerry Bruckheimer; the name strikes fear into my heart.The man honestly cannot tell the difference between action and boredom. With him its hit or miss.In this case, hit.Big hit.Tom Cruise's performance is stellar, playing a role that he would end upplaying again and again as the overconfident 'Maverick' who eventuallylearns his lesson.  And a ham-handed lesson it is, hammered home in the endby his constant "I'm not leaving my wingman!" yell.Val Kilmer shines...heck, the whole supporting cast shines!  Meg Ryan,Anthony Edwards, Rim Robbins, Micheal Ironsides, Skerrit--they all comethrough beautifully.  The action scenes are some of the best aerial shotsever shot.On to the complaints.Jerry Bruckheimer loads the sap on with a cement truck, nearly drowning thismovie in it.  The dialogue is corny.  Basically--the very things that madethe entire movie 'Armageddon' horrible mar the corners of Top Gun.  Theending is worse than corny; it's a clear case of deus ex machina.  A veryclear case.  The deus almost knocked me out of my seat.A satisfying movie, altogether.  Four out of five stars.
