A bunch of "hunks" fly around for some training course. Of course, they seemto spend a large amount of time with nothing on but towels and underwear orplaying volleyball shirtless. During the "romantic" scenes, I felt likeyelling at the TV "Uh, hello movie, are you there, wake up....do something."The acting isn't that great either or the dialogue, I mean who came up with"You stink" or "It's confidential!" I was amazed by such great dialogue. Ofcourse to top it all off, the hero wins a big battle and has "his name onthe front page of every English written newspaper in the world". Also, hisfriend dies and I guess we were supposed to feel sad about it, I suppose.Basic routine here, lots of noise, lots of music, very littlebrains.
