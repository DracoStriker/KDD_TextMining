For the record, I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan. I really don't like himthat much and I think he seems to be a bit over the top at all times.Regardless of that I do watch some of his films at least the ones thatI want to watch.The basic gist of the film is that Cruise plays a USN pilot who goes toan academy called TOP Gun to see if he has what it takes to be one ofthe best pilots around. Overall it's a good film, regardless of themistakes that are made, which are more or less for military terms andwhat not.If you enjoy military films or enjoy Tom cruise in general then youwill not be disappointed by watching this film.
