This movie, when you get down to it, is essentially an 80's Harry Potter inflight school, with Ron being Goose, Malfoy being Iceman, and ProfessorMcGonagall being a hot flight instructor that Harry has intrercourse with.Any who, this is a movie to watch with your Tom Cruise obsessed gal (or guy)because he has his shirt off 45% of the time, smiles 85% of the time, andflies in a jet a lot. Instead of being a action movie with chick movieelements to keep the ladies in, this is a chick flick with action in it. Butthanks to great aerial photography, a spectacular duo in Cruise and AnthonyEdwards, and a few funny moments ( this movie doesn't work serious) this oneis one that us guys don't mind watching... too much.
