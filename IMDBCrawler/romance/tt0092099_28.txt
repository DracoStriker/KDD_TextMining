I remember when I saw Top Gun for the first time. I was 3 years old, andIwanted to become a pilot.At that time, Top Gun was my favourite movie. It still is in some ways,buta lot has changed. (Tom Cruise has done other movies)The story is simple, but I love this movie. Just to watch Tom Cruisebeeingthis macho man and a softy at the same time is really fun.To be honest, the intro is the best part of the movie, except Tom ofcourse."The students call it... TOP GUN"One can really live into the story while watching them sitting in theirbenches, or flying around in the air.
