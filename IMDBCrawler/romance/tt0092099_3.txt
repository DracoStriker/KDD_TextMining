The fact that people are still writing about this film 15yrs after it wasfirst released (and I'm not just talking about me!) really says a lot. Iwasdubious about writing a comment, seeing as it really has been ages sinceitwas released and thinking that most people who wanted to see it probablyalready have. After recently watching it for the umpteenth time on TV, Ifelt compelled to write a quickie ;) I have to say, it's the first time Ilooked up Top Gun on the imdb and I was actually quite surprised that itonly received a 6.4 rating. If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't judgeit by the ratings, read a few user comments first and just rent it out, Iguarantee you'll have a good time, especially with its amazing soundtrack!The best 80's songs ever written, I still get chills down my backlisteningto them ;) It's a simple plot but there's something about it that makes itaseriously enjoyable film and one you can watch time and time again. Gohavefun! Enjoy!
