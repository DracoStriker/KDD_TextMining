Murphy's Law was written for movies like this.  It's obvious that JerryBruckheimer and Tom Cruise were trying to pawn off to the almighty dollar intheir creation of this abyssmal flick.  Thankfully, Platoon and ALIENSkicked its butt at the Oscars, if not the box office.  Then again, theOscars are a moot point.Top Gun wants to be patriotic, but winds up being an embarrasment and wasteof time.  The plot has enough holes to be an imitation Swiss cheesesubstitute and the acting is horrendous.  Tom Cruise proves he can be atotal twit without ability.  Thank God for Rain Man.  Fighter jock wannabes(oh, I'm sorry, the navy calls them "aviators") take note: you can't fly ifyou are the height of Tom Cruise.  Here endeth the lesson.  Even the editingis atrocious.  What a sloppy production!  You'll find yourself hating themusic either on the spot or down the road.  Believe me.Overall, a movie I saw once and don't want to see again.  I hated it.  1 outof 5 stars.
