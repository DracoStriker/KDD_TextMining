It took almost fifteen years until I watched Top Gun for the firsttime.I clearly remember that this movie was very popular when it ran intheGerman theatres in 1987 and I heard a lot about this mixture ofaction,adventure and romance. I never expected Top Gun to be amasterpiece.However, I always thought that I had missed something, not havingseenit. But when I actually watched this movie one week ago it occuredtome that I was wrong. Action and adventure? A bunch of guys that want to be herosdoingnothing but cracking stupid jokes and flying around in jets allthetime, finally fighting (and of course winning) against a namelessenemy(i.e. the Soviet Union).No thrill at all. No explanation of the Cold War background atall.Dialogues as silly as can be, leaving me helpless whether to laughorcry. Romance? Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis in something that ismeantto be a love story but fails to convey the slightest touch ofromance.Acting? Cruise and Kilmer in their ridiculous "Who gets to performthebroadest grin/the ugliest sneer?"-competition. The single funnyaspectis the music score, a synthesizer sound emerging from the deepestdepthsof the 1980s, this very strange decade.Let's face it: Top Gun is nothing but a commercial for the US Navy(justthink of the jets starting from and landing on the carrier in thewarm,red light of sunrise or sunset) and a perfect example ofthehyper-patriotism of the Reagan era. The movie depicts some sortofunreflected militarism that is not my cup of tea.Only in terms of technique (cinematography, editing ?) this workisquite all right. So Top Gun isn't exactly one of the worst butsurelyone of the silliest movies I have ever seen: 2 out of 10 -period.
