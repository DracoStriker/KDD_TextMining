Not only is this the most contrived, stupid, jingoistic, predictable,unnecessary piece of celluloid to drop from the rancid console ofReagan-era Hollywood, it's also the gayest mainstream movie of thedecade, including Chariots of Fire. Turn down the sound and you'llmerely see pretty muscle boys with perfect hair and spotless uniformsignoring women in a bar, glistening in their tighty-whities as theypose for each other in the shower room, waiting for their mustachioeddaddy (Skerritt) to affirm them before they go off and strap hugemachines between their legs, and preening for each other on thevolleyball court. Turn the sound up, and it's even better. "I'm gettinga hard-on." "Don't tease me." "So's my Johnson." In short, not only abad film, but also an unbelievably gay one. Drink up, RepublicanAmerica! So's my Johnson!
