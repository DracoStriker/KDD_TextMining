Made when Ridley Scott still made good films and Tony Scott made, well,Tony Scott films - this one is based on the premise that a rampantlyjingoistic aeroplane flick won't need add-on extras like a plot,characterisation or good dialogue.Having dated rather less well than Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction,Top Gun remains problematic. Well toned, well oiled men wandersemi-naked around the set while Jeffrey Kimball's camera lingers withlascivious attention on every protruding pectoral. Men like Goose andSlider sit behind Maverick and Iceman. Was the, presumably bored,scriptwriter having a laugh at the expense of a homophobic US military?I'm an optimist; I like to think so.The "plot" centres on a pilot, scarred by the shabby treatment hisfather received at the hands of the military. Logically he would becomean investigative journalist or something; try to clear his old pa'sname. But then this is a Tony Scott film, a medium which logic hastraditionally given a wide berth. Instead he becomes (surprise) apilot, and tries to prove the old boy's innocence in a kind ofmodernist's trial by ordeal. During this quest he loses his tail gunner(ahem, navigator), forms a new and lasting relationship and evenexperiments briefly with heterosexuality.The dialogue uses a device common to many modern books/films (c.f.Outbreak, John Grisham novels) - the guttural gruntings of thecharacters being liberally interspersed with technical jargon, thusrelieving the writer of anything more challenging than regurgitating atextbook. Happily this also removes any feeling of nagging unease theaudience could feel if confronted with long words they might beexpected to know.Nice flight sequences though, and rather like Microsoft Word, which hasjust tried to replace my use of "less well" with "fewer wells" - TopGun can be, at times, unintentionally hilarious.
