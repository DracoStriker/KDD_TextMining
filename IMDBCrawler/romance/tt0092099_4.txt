Top gun, loved and loathed by many alike. The film that launched TomCruise's career. I'm a student and watching Top Gun for me is anamazing uplifting experience. A 'feel good' movie that could lift theworse of moods.The film executes cheese to perfection, yes there are some silly linesbut there are some real good ones too! The aerial action sequences aretruly amazing, and for 1986 nothing short of magnificent.The reason why Top Gun appeals to me...Imagine yourself on a Saturdaynight, not painting the town red staying in for the night. You haveyour few cans of Budweiser, your nachos what more could you ask for.From the amazing flight sequences, Mavericks motorbike, trashy romanceand to the cool 80's soundtrack. Top Gun should be taken for what itis. An entertaining Film.
