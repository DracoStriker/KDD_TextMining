I have lost count of the number of times I have watched this movie andit never disappoints when I get to see again.Switch off the brain, sit back and be entertained is the easiest way todescribe it. DO NOT overthink it.Tom Cruise, Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerrit, Michael Ironside, Meg Ryan,Val Kilmer, Tim Robbins and the list goes on, the movie is packed tothe rafters with good and great actors.It has comedy, drama, romance and action all the way through.If you haven't seen it already and like action packed movies doyourself a favour.
