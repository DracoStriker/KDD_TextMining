This is one of those movies that slipped through my fingers for manyyears. I can't tell why, I just missed any opportunity to watch itbefore. Well, today I had a look at it. Overall I thought it wasamusing, it felt very typical and the cheesiness was really over thetop. It's not a movie you can take seriously. It would probably havebeen a blast if I was younger and I understand a lot of people havenostalgia for it. It didn't do much for me unfortunately. It wasdifficult to see past all the clichés and silly moments.The soundtrack is nice, no faults there. I loved the camera filtersthey used. The whole movie is highly saturated and it seems like theentire thing was filmed at golden hour. All the flight scenes arepretty spectacular. Must have been difficult to film them. Thecharacters are stereotypical and corny. Every other scene it's likesomeone's gonna say "Oh, you!" or something similar. The story goesthrough all the typical beats. You can easily guess what's gonnahappen. So, it's not a movie you should go to if you are looking fordepth. I've always admired Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer, he isactually my favorite movie producer. I haven't seen much of TonyScott's work. I enjoy his visual style the most of what I've seen sofarIt's an 80's time capsule and it's typical, cheesy and clichéd, I know.But, it was still decent fun. You can turn your brain off and beentertained. So, that's OK. Maybe I expected too much from it.
