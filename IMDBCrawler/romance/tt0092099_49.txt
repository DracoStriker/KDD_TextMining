Top Gun is pure quality for many reasons, be it the hard hitting balladsoundtrack, the magnificent camera work or the great pace of the film.Many fans of aviation and aspiring pilots were made purely throughwatching this classic as children, and after you've watched it, it'seasy to see why...Tom Cruise stars as Maverick, with his youth and charm flawlesslysuiting the hotshot protagonist of the film. Cruise strikes the perfectbalance in presenting Maverick as a pilot who lives life on the edge,but isn't totally out of control. Kelly McGillis does a good job too,yet her lack of any truly memorable scenes gives her the appearance ofbeing in Cruise's shadow somewhat. The movie's pace is poised well,with quieter, slower scenes slotting in between the more intense actionsequences. This neatly brings us onto the camera work, which is simplyout of this world. The F14s are shot in splendid aerial sequences wherethey perform all manner of crazy manoeuvres and stunts in summerylocations. The scenes involving Maverick's bike in particular seem toevoke the strong sense of youth found throughout the film. Thesoundtrack is marvellous and remains famous to this day, with vintageclassics by artists such as The Righteous Brothers intermixed with 80srock ballads and quieter melodies for the more sombre scenes. Unlikemany modern action films, Tony Scott gives Maverick genuine obstaclesand tribulations to overcome, which invokes a much greater sense offulfilment and maturity by the picture's conclusion. Top Gun has inspired future pilots all around the world and continuesto do so. It's a film of passion, energy and youth, but also oflearning and coming of age. Those born after the film's era may findthemselves wishing they'd been alive through it, as not many filmscapture the vibrancy of the 80s, or the excitement of being a pilot,like Top Gun does.
