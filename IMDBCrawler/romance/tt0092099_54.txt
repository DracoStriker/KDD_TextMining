Top Gun is a good movie for those 12 and up. Top Gun touches us on manylevels. It touches our intellect level by showing how important school(classroom) is in learning to be a good fighter pilot. It touches ourheart by the romance between Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan. It touches ourneed for adventure and competition with the air flights and competitionbetween pilots. However, it is competition and adventure with apurpose, to give the knowledge to survive. Top gun may even be aninspiring film to get people to enroll in the US Military as fightpilots or support air staff. Top Gun is entertaining as well. I thoughtthat Michael Ironside made a good flight instructor. I give the filmseven thumbs up. A slightly memorable film, and love does conquer all.
