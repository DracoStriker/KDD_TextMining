Well known as the picture that turned Tom Cruise into an internationalicon and coming with one of the great memorable soundtracks, "Top Gun"is an enjoyable first-rate Eighties movie.Maverick (Cruise) and his best friend Goose (Anthony Edwards) are twococky, talented pilots working in the US Navy. After they succeed inrescuing a fellow pilot who nearly died in mid-air combat, theircommanding officer Stinger (James Tolkan) decides to send them to TopGun, a top flying school that trains the best of the best of the USNavy's fighter pilots...The plot is in some ways a parallel to "An Officer and a Gentlemen",which was made much earlier in the decade. Both movies are set inside aflight school, both have a troubled central character (in that movie itwas Richard Gere, here it's Tom Cruise) who must confront their pastand negotiate a romance in the course of the movie. The main characterin both movies has a best friend who comes to a tragic end, and bothmovies feature a very memorable romantic theme song.In terms of plot and characters, "Top Gun" is ever so slightly inferiorto the earlier movie. The main strength in the cast is Cruise, whoholds the movie up with likable charm and strong inner intensity. KellyMcGillis is slightly stilted as his love interest. She performs therole well, but she cannot really compete with Cruise. Because of this,the romance holds no real frisson and it is only the soundtrack playingin the background of their love scenes that allows the relationship togenerate any chemistry.Anthony Edwards does well in the role of Goose, but his character istoo underdeveloped that when he eventually meets his tragic fate itlacks the impact that it should. Tom Skerrit, Micheal Ironside andJames Tolkan are fine as the flight school commanders and Val Kilmer isenjoyable arrogant as Maverick's rival Iceman.The brilliantly shot dogfight sequences give a stirring anddisorienting realistic feel of real-life airborne combat, and thesecombined with the searingly memorable title track "Take My Breath Away"are the picture's technical highlights.
