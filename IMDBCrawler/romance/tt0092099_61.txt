This movie couldn't have been as good as it is if it had been madetoday. They just really had the hang of it in the 80's, especially whenit comes to easy action-flicks like this one. Of the "aircombat"-movies I have seen (I have not seen that many of them), this isclearly the best. Why is that? Well, the story is quite interesting.Also, I really like some of the military-characters in the movie.Especially "Viper". Tom Skerrit does a really good job with him. Thereare also lots of cool action in the movie. The last scene is the best.Unfortunately, there's a rather long drama-part in the middle of themovie that destroys the great action-feeling a bit, but everything getsOK as soon as it ends. And last, this movie has the best soundtrackever!! "Danger Zone", "Mighty Wings" and "Through the Fire" are forevertrue classics.
