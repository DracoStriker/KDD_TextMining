FINALLY saw this movie on Netflix. It's just been a legend for about 30years!Extremely well done movie. I have absolutely zero interest in fighterjets so the movie really kept my attention with the story line, pacing,acting, script, great music. Tom Cruise was amazingly handsome in this film. Val Kilmer as well. Infact, all of the stars of the film are surprisingly gorgeous on screen. The only thing I disliked is that it is basically propaganda for themilitary. I can't even imagine how many young men watched this movie asyoung boys and dreamed of becoming fighter pilots (a dream many boysshare, apparently, but very hard to do. I was horrified at the verythought of trying to fly over obstacles (mountains in Nevada in thefilm) while trying to evade another aircraft, all while being subjectedto extreme G force at over 800 miles an hour) so I must say this filmdid increase my respect of the men (and a couple of women) who are ableto accomplish this feat. Definitely worth a watch or two.
