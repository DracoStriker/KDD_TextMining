Before Tom Cruise went all Scientology, Kelly McGillis was a lesbian,Anthony Edwards in the ER, Val Kilmer in the Doors, and unknowns TimRobbins and Meg Ryan in the film before they became stars.The movie was the best reason for the mid 1980s. As Cruise is Mavericka hotshot Navy pilot who helped save another fellow flier. He andsidekick Edwards Goose, are sent to the Top Gun school to train withthe best.And in the process, Cruise falls in love with McGillis Charlie, thecivilian flight instructor. Who he met at the bar the night before. Asboth must hide their feelings for one another.And he and Edwards must deal with pilots such as Kilmer's Iceman. Asthe pilots must get points for only first place and no points areawarded for second place.Still it is a film that is the best of yesterday, today, and tomorrowregardless of what you think about Cruise today.
