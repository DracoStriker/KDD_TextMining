Two young aircraft pilots are sent to Top Gun after saving their fellowbuddy from crashing his aircraft. Top Gun is a school that trains thetop one percent of pilots in the United States. Maverick is an expertpilot who flies with Goose, a great friend and a great pilot. Maverickfights against his rival Iceman and they battle for a trophy for bestpilot. The outstanding actor in the movie was Tom Cruise who playedMaverick. He acted like a dangerous bad boy with no limits. He had afearless attitude towards everything, and Cruise nailed his roleperfectly. Others actors such as Anthony Edwards (Goose) and KellyMcGillis (Charlie) acted well but didn't stand out as much as Cruise.Top Gun is a fun movie, but it's nothing more than a blockbusterrental. Adults will like the movie more than kids. The 110 minute moviemight be too long for children and could bore them, and adults wouldappreciate the romance scenes more.
