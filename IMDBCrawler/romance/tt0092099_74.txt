There isn't anything else to say.  The soundtrack, the story, the cast,thechemistry.  This movie is THE BEST ever made.  I was in 4th grade when itcame into the theaters and I saw it there, to the complete depletion of mypiggy bank (as it was) at least 12 times.  Anyone growing up who saw thisasa kid had to want to be a fighter pilot.  Every American who saw this wasproud at the end to be one.  It doesn't get any better than that.EVER.
