This is my favorite film. But not because there was a special message oftheacting was great - there was obviously none of that. It's my favorite filmbecause of the F-14 Tomcat. The air combat scenes are by far the best ofanyjet fighter film. They are great because no shots were computer images!There was trick photography in some shots, like using models that shotmissiles and the one scene where 'Maverick' and 'Goose' did the inverteddiveand flipped-off the MiG pilot was made by splicing two pieces of filmtogether.The aerial shots in "Flight of the Intruder" were great as well, but someshots, such as the night shots, were computer generated. Even the TV show"JAG" uses F-14 scenes from "Top Gun" and computer generates them. It maybemore cost-efective to do that, but nothing beats filming the real thing.All in all, I can give nothing but props to the cinematogrophy andediting.As for the acting and storyline.... that's another story!
