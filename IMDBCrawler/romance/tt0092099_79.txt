Top Gun is very much a product of its 80's time, and I consider that agreat thing!The movie follows Lt. Pete Mitchell during his education through the topUS Navy flight school, Top Gun.  I loved the combat!  While at theflight school, three storylines develop: one is a romance, one is thefight to be the best, and the final is a tragic storyline.  Eachstoryline "thread" only makes the movie better, by fleshing out thecharacters in the movie.One of the best parts of the movie is the end, but I won't give it away.I will, however, tell you that it is very exciting!While some elements of the movie are obviously very fanciful, it isfanciful in a fun way...  And that is the reason we watch movies, isn'tit?  This is a movie that I will gladly watch over and over.~Nick~
