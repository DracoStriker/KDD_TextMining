Wow! The main thing that I can say about TOP GUN is, "What a ride!"Lieutenant Mitchell (Tom Cruise), in my opinion, was a VERY courageoussoldier. His partner, Lieutenant Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards) was the sameway, too. When they sang "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'," I thought theysounded good. Also, I was taken aback by the airplane stunts! They wereTOTALLY breathtaking and intriguing. To me, Charlie (Kelly McGillis) lookedVERY pretty in the dressy outfits she wore when she taught at the academy. Iliked the fact that she was very strict and business-like. In conclusion, IHIGHLY recommend this smash hit to all you people who are Tom Cruise fans orlike a good action/drama with a little romance and lots of plane stunts init.
