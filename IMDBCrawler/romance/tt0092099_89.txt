I read a lot of criticism slamming Top Gun as cliched andpredictable.You could call Top Gun cliched in the same way Star Wars is cliched.  Thesemovies use themes and plotlines that have been done over in countlessmovies.But Top Gun is 15 years old!  Like Star Wars, it wasn't following the tried,stale plot cliches; it was SETTING them and writing them:  The daredevil,insubordinate pilot.  The grizzled teacher who used to fly with the hero's"old man."  The old man himself, who was thought to die dishonorably, butwas actually a hero as well.  The wingman who dies and weighs heavily on thehero's conscious.Yes, it's all old and played out... NOW, 15 years later.  Top Gun was one ofthe first to combine these elements into one plot.  It is story telling atits best.  That is why so many movies and shows have tried to imitate itover the past two decades.
