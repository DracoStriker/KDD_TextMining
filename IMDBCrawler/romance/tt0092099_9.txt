To start, I watched thousands of movies, literally (The Godfather,Goodfellas, etc..). And from my perspective, Top Gun is an averagepopcorn flick. The plot is as cheesy as any movie. After you watch themovie for a while, the story will fade but something else will stickwith you. That thing is what forced me to give this movie a 9/10. Whatis that thing? Well, the feel of the movie, the mode. The 80s freshair. And the beautiful soundtrack. These things overcome all the flawsin this all-flawed movie. This is the weirdest review I have everwrote, but it's true. You will like and detest this movie at the sametime. The question is: what feeling will you choose? To conclude, thisis a really terrible movie but one of my favorites. Give it a chance(on a big screen) and you won't be disappointed or will you?
