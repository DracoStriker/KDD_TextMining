This film, when viewed in retrospect, is symptomatic of the 1980'syuppie culture. When Mavrick's best friend dies his girlfriendvirtually disowns him and only takes him back when he has some earningpotential again (when he regains his Mojo, so to speak).In fact, the phallus plays a crucial role in the film, from it'sembodiment in the physical shape of the airplane all the way through toCruise playing with his stout beer bottle in the final scene. And whyis it that you have semi-naked men playing beach volleyball hugging oneanother as often as they possibly can? Probably to keep Julian Clary(and Graham Norton (if you are American and do not know who JulianClary is)) happy....Still, saying that, if you take your brain out of gear and marvel atthe production values rather than the script then it's an OK way topass a couple of hours of your life. Do remember though, you'll neverget those couple of hours back - so be warned if you hate it andrealise after you should've watched a rerun of Citizen Kane.
