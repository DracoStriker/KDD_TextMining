Only if you are a fighter plane freak then you will like this movie. This isone of the most boring, stupid, and tedious experiences I have had to sitthrough. I saw it about 4 years ago at my cousins place, because I wasforced too because he loves the movie and made me watch it. I found it themost boring, dumb, and embarrasing movies I have had to undergo. I wish totake the time I spent watching it back! 2/10.
