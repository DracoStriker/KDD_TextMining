Top Gun - on the surface, a militaristic, macho-adrenalin movie with theobligatory love interest. Pure Reagan-era Hollywood. But ONLY on thesurface, that is.Read between the lines, as Tarantino did to such infamy, and you'll soonbegin to see what's really going on in this film. If you don't see it, watchSleep With Me, a 1994 movie in which Quentin Tarantino cameos (late-on) at aparty and does little more than completely re-interpret Top Gun. It's funny,and probably spot-on. Just listen to Hollywood and Wolfman the first time wesee them in the briefing room.Then when you've rewatched Top Gun, try watching Point Break, BatmanForever, and a few others like that.Regardless of your politics, Top Gun is a fun movie, one of those oh-so 80sfilms that defined their era - it's usually found in the same collection asFerris Bueller, The Goonies, St.Elmo's Fire, Dirty Dancing and that sort ofstuff. Kitsch.Oh, and the leads (Cruise, McGillis and Kilmer) are all gorgeoushere.
