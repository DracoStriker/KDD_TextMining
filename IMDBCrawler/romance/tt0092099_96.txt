Despite the kitsch, 80s context in which we now see it, and Tarantino'shysterical spiel about how, deep down, Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise justwant to be saucy with each other's bottoms, this really is a prettydrab movie. Cruise is an ugly, obnoxious dwarf and Kelly McGillisappears to be watching a promising career slip away from her as thefilm unfurls. Tim Robbins is wasted, and never trust a man called Val.When I first saw Top Gun, I fell off my seat laughing at the bit whereAnthony Edwards dies. This is, and this alone, makes it worth twomarks.It's just a load of vacuous pish and poopoo, with a glossy productionsheen.
