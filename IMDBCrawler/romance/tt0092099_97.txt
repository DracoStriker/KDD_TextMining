I have flown just about everything under the sun, starting with theF-15 for the Air force, then going to the F-14, and F/A-18 during a AirForce/Navy pilot exchange program, so naturally, I'm drawn to any movieabout aircraft. Top gun was THE BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME!!! the movie isnothing more then a glorified romance! I can honestly say that whoeverdecided to make this movie should be castrated with rusty kitchenscissors. I could have handled the fake missiles, and the F-5's servingas Mig's, as long as there wasn't any romance. This movie SUCKED, themusic sucked, and most of the actors sucked. just thinking about thismovie makes me contemplate suicide.
