What a dog! An extended music video, scenes strung together with music andTom Cruise's (albeit killer) smile and sweat sheen.  McGillis is TOTALLYmiscast, and no self-respecting woman would fall for these lines.  She iscompletely unbelievable mouthing her character's jobspeak, as well.  Do our"top guns" really behave this way and associate with people like this?God...I saw this at original release and again last night, and it went froma 5 to a 1.  An absolute dog.  I wonder how Tim Robbins, a man of talent,views this exercise now.
