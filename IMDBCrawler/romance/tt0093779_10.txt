The simplest pleasures in life are the best, and this film is one of them.Combining a rather basic storyline of love and adventure this movietranscends the usual weekend fair with wit and unmitigated charm.  Everycharacter is a delight and you just want to see more of them.  "The PrincessBride" is based on the unsurpassed novel by William Goldman, who also pennedthe screenplay. While this is a movie review, I cannot recommend the book onwhich it is based more highly.  It is quite simply the most humorous,enthralling fable ever written and will fill in many details that wereimpossible to include on the screen.  The only other movie of this typethat I can think of that is this much fun was Danny Kaye's "The CourtJester," another costumed comedy/adventure/romance that I also highlyrecommend.
