I very rarely like to put 10/10 for a rating of something as I feelnothing is perfect. However, this movie i feel is so close to that10/10 it would be wrong not to award it this. Although it may not bethe greatest movie ever made, it is brilliant in its own right. Thecharacters are humorous, the dialogue is witty and the cast isbrilliant. It contains so many different elements which also make it areally good family film. Action, adventure, sword-fighting, pirates,romance, comedy and fantasy. It captures all the elements I couldWhilst I still stand by the fact that the book is better, this is stillmy favourite film.
