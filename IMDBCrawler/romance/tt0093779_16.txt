The story is catchy and I like the dialog - they are witty. I laugh sohard especially the scene when the Man in Black is trying to climb upThe Cliffs of Insanity without the rope and Montoya tried to rush himbecause he cannot wait to kill him and the torture scene when the Counttrying to get a survey from Westley (I mean who does that? But itworks). From that point on things got crazy. The Princess is beautifuland Westley is amazing with his "as you wish" romanticism and charminggaze. The bond between the boy, played by Savage, and his grandfather issweet and almost comedic especially about the kissing scenes. Overall,the story is very funny and I think it catches the attention of manypeople despite its ridiculous story line like reviving Westley that"mostly dead". The characters are all funny and I can't stop laughingand I'm going to watch it again in a few seconds.Watch this with your kids and friends.
