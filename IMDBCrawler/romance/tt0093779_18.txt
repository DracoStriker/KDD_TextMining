Cary Elwes and Robyn Wright in a fantasy story of epic proportions, howcan you improve on that? Even with Peter Falk as the Narrator beinginterrupted by his grandson Fred Savage just seem to fit and ratherthan distract from an epic movie it just enhances the viewersexperience.The Princess Bride is a fantasy romantic adventure movie with just theright blend of comedy, action, adventure and romance to suit everyone'staste.I love Andre the Giant as the Brute, Fezzik. Mandy Patinkin as InigoMontoya will forever be to me the perfect model of a Spanish duelist.His line from the move is almost as famous as the movie itself. "Myname is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father! Prepare to die!"And the fight scene between Inigo Montoya and the Man in Black is trulyepic while still being tongue in the cheek.This is a movie nobody should ever try to remake, just watch theoriginal and fall in love with it as you do the characters.
