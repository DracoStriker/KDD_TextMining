This is one of those rare films that gets better each time you watch it.With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action,adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are beautiful to watch and the story of theirlove is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out inthis story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some ofthe best lines in the film. Chris Sarandon is perfect in his role as the badguy prince.The plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together andlevels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of veryfunny catch phrases-  many of which are still part of my repertoire morethan a decade after I first saw the movie.   If you like dry humor and fastwit, The Princess Bride will make your day.I have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it hasbecome my 'sick day' movie because it is such a joy.
