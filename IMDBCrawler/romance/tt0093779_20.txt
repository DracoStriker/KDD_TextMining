This has to be one of the most overrated movies of all time. I don'tknow what it is, but it may have to do with how old you were when youfirst saw it. I'm guessing that when the movie was first released, alot of guys took their dates to see it ? women typically love romanticthemes, even when done badly ? and got laid that night or something,hence they remember it fondly. Or it's possible that even youngeraudiences were fans of TV's "The Wonder Years" and loved Fred Savage orsomething. But for anyone who wasn't younger than 25 at the time of itsrelease, this movie's popularity is an enigma: As a comedy, it's notvery funny. As a fantasy, it's just bad. It has some qualities as anaction adventure, though it comes off as a cheap imitation of a crossbetween the Robin Hood story and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (asilly movie that works, at least for most guys, in a way that the ThreeStooges do not); shame on Peter Cook. Overall, the story is childish,the dialog is juvenile ("She is alive, or was an hour ago. If she isotherwise when I find her I shall be very put out". Come on!) andrepetitive, the sets are pathetic, the acting is abysmal (Andre theGiant and that annoying little dweeb, please), and the special effects(rodents of unusual size) ? ugh!
