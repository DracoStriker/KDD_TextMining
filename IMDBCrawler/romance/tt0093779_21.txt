The disappointment that I had with this movie I think can be attributedto how many people copied off of it. From what I have gathered, thiswas the first time anyone had done a non- traditional fairy tale andpeople loved that. But now, Disney does that every time it adapts afairy tale. All of the elements of Princess Bride can be found ineither the Shrek movies or one of the Disney "fairy tales with atwist". So Princess Bride hardly felt revolutionary to me after seeingso many movies that modeled themselves off of it. It's really too bad,because I think I might have really enjoyed it if not for that.The story follows many of the conventions of a fairy tale, so that wasa little disappointing. There were plenty of good scenes, though, andmuch of it was amusing or at least entertaining. The actionchoreography was pretty good for what it was. Low budget, or at leastnot huge budget like we see today, but still pretty exciting and notthat violent. The turns are not exactly predictable, but they aren'tdevastatingly unexpected. They just sort of happen.I think I was also expecting there to be more of a Monty Python or Menin Tights feel to it, which there was a little bit. But a lot of themovie had a surprisingly serious tone to it, enough that there weremany times when I didn't know whether I was supposed to laugh. In someways, this isn't bad. It can be kind of annoying to have the jokes holdup a "laugh" sign next to them. But it decreases the entertainmentlevel a little.All things considered, it's well crafted. I wouldn't say that it'sanything you should study as an aspiring filmmaker, but the people whoworked on it did a good job. I wouldn't recommend that you watch it ifyou don't think you'll like it. You can only enjoy this movie if you gointo it with an open mind. It's a good family movie, but most kidsunder about 8 won't appreciate it that much. Overall Rating: 7.3/10.
