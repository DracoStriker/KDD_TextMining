I do not like romantic movie for a start. I think them nothing morethan a cash cow in order to attract stupid girls in order to live theirunrealistic love fantasies and if they have a boyfriend to torture himin the process. But sometimes , one in a thousand I may say it comes aromantic flick that is a quality entertainment for everyone, EVERYONE.Princess Bride belongs in this category because it focuses more in thestory ,making it fun, and to the characters in order for the romancesto become more "realist", in which I mean to make sense the couple towant to be together and you to wanted that to.Also the sword fights arewell choreographed and the one liners are clever,funny and take you offguard. To everyone guy, who have a girlfriend ,if you try to find aromantic movie that you can have fun alongside your romantic partnerwith out wanting to shoot yourself after words ,then this the flick foryou ,have fun!
