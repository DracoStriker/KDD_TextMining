A romance, a comedy, an adventure & a fantasy, The Princess Bride is anamalgamation of all of these and is a fairy tale that has been passedfrom fathers to sons for generations and here is presented in the formof a novel that is being read by a grandfather to his grandson, thusmaking sure that the book's narrative style & structure is keptentirely preserved.The Princess Bride tells the story of Buttercup who falls in love witha farm guy but loses him and is at last engaged to the Prince of theregion. One day, she is kidnapped & held against her will by threehired helpers; a Sicilian boss, a Spanish swordsman & a giant. But theysoon find themselves being pursued by a mysterious masked man who'sgaining on their trail.Rob Reiner has directed some well-known classics (A Few Good Men, Standby Me & When Harry Met Sally...) but most people are still not familiarwith his name because unlike other filmmakers, he has no unique styleof shooting a film or possesses a trademark. And this is another one ofhis films that's pretty different in style & approach when compared tohis other works. And Reiner does a good job at it.The screenplay is adapted from the book of the same name in a mannerthat preserves its narrative style, camera-work & editing nicelycompliment each other, visuals effects never aims for a realisticportrayal of the world depicted in the story plus it benefits very muchfrom its sweet, tender & pleasant performances from its cast, includingAndre the Giant.On an overall scale, there isn't much wrong with The Princess Bride &carries out most of its elements the way it's meant to be. Moreentertaining than what I was expecting from it, definitely showing alot of heart, warmth & charm and yet it didn't click enough with me forI'm not really a fan of fairy tales. But for those who've read the bookor heard the story or even many newcomers, this will be a delightfulexperience.
