You will almost never see two ambidextrous fencers set to in any filmanywhere. And it was pure coincidence that Carey Elwes and MandyPitilkin, Roberts and Inigo respectively, were brought together tofence for this movie. It was, according to the director, unknown inadvance that either of them were that good, or that they'd have suchchemistry that fencing for the fun of it distracted them from filmingall through the production.Although it's a low-key Fantasy in terms of magic and monsters, thefairy-tale style carries the story nicely. A dry tongue-in-cheek witplays all the way through, with a script that's almost entirely classiclines from beginning to end.
