In the course of a story which a grandfather is reading to his sickgrandson, we see the adventures of farm boy Westley in pursuit ofPrincess Buttercup.On one level, The Princess Bride plays absolutely fair with fairy storyconventions - heroes are heroes, villains are villains, and weirdin-between characters are weird in-between characters. The story playsout in a satisfactorily linear fashion, adhering to standard fantasystory tropes.And then, on another level, The Princess Bride is a subversivedeconstruction of the traditional stories it mimics. It is frequentlyvery funny indeed, it boasts some wonderful performances (both CaryElwes and Mandy Patinkin play their roles with a precise combination ofstraight face and tongue in cheek, and Wallace Shawn is simplyhysterical), and it has the best sword fight for a long time. And it isendlessly quotable. Funny, exciting and charming, it is a film totreasure.
