I hadn't even heard of The Princess Bride until very recently. Butevidently it has something of a good reputation and I am guessing thatit may have been a sleeper hit that gained its reputation over a numberof years as opposed to a film that hit the mark on initial release.Having seen it I'm still not entirely sure why this one has gained thereputation it has, as it didn't really seem all that remarkable to beperfectly honest.Its story takes the form of a sweet natured traditional adventurenarrative. It's set in a fantasy land but unusually is told from theperspective of the present day with scenes of a grandfather reading thetitle book to his ill grandson. It has a strong romantic subplot andhas very clear morals, with no grey areas. Consequently its simplicitymakes it very well suited to children. But it can appeal quite well toadults too because it does have a lot of humour. It's helped in thisarea quite a bit by having a very good cast. There are too many tomention but my favourite character was the evil hunchback played byWallace Shawn. The scene where he has a battle of wits with the heroover a poisoned drink is the funniest and best moment in the film forme. So all-in-all, it's certainly a likable enough movie but oneprobably, in fairness, not aimed at me. However, I cannot avoid notcommenting on its weakest aspect because it was so, so terrible Icouldn't believe it. The music. Oh, deary me, the music. For a filmwith some evident production values on screen it was completely bizarrethat the soundtrack was so horribly tinny, like it had been composedand performed on a Casio keyboard!
