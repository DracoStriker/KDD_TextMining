The fantasy genre is poorly represented, but Princess Bride makes up for alot of it.  It manages to be touching (primarily through Mandy Patinkin)without being smarmy, and yet hits on every fantasy cliche withtongue-in-cheek panache.  Funny, memorable, quotable, and a wonderful twiston fairy tales that adults and kids alike can enjoy.
