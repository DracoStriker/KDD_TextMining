If not, I don't know where you're coming from.Someof the most famous acting talents came together to form THE PRINCESS BRIDE,and 1 great director.Rob Reiner directs this all-star cast, in you not-so-average fairytaleadventure. Filled with swashbuckling sword fights, tremendous thrills,incredible romance, excellent actors and cameos, a very original comediclook at fairytales, and so much more, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is the SHREK oftheeighties.The acting itself is flawless. Robin Wright plays Buttercup who falls inlove with her servant boy Westley (Cary Elwes). After he sets off to sea tofind fortunes, she is told the dread pirate Robinson killed him. Sheimmediately becomes a recluse, and mutters the words, `I will never loveagain?'Some years later, she is engaged to Prince Humperdink, who is marrying herjust to kill her and blame it on a distant land---the result of whichstarting a war. Unaware of his plans, a trio comprised of a short man(Wallace Shawn), a revenge sought swordsman (Mandy Patinkin) and an 8-footgiant (Andre the Giant) set out to do THE SAME thing, by kidnapping her,killing her, and placing her on the distant land. In this process, thedreadpirate Robinson, who turns out to be none other than her long lost servantboy, rescues her. Now they have the Prince chasing them, and the plot onlycontinues to grow as they go through the dreaded fire swamp, and are caughtup with by the Prince, who takes the servant to be tortured, eventuallybeing rescued by the giant and the swordsman of the trio, of whom want tohelp him save the Princess Buttercup before it's too late.The Princess Bride is wonderfully acted, filmed, and has just a goodfantasy feel to it. Like I said before, it's the SHREK of the eighties.After seeing this film, you just know it's destined to become a classic, ofwhich it has become. Just the sheer original genius of this film earns it 4stars, much less the rest of the film. 4/5 starsJOHN ULMER
