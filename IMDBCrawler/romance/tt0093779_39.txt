I believe that The Princess Bride is one of the best films everconceived. I've read the book, which was equally incredible, and I justlove the entire concept of this story. All of the characters are justso lovable and the story simply captured my heart in the beginning anddidn't let go until the end. Some may find it a bit corny, but I trulyappreciated every aspect of the film. It was exciting. It was romantic.It was funny. William Goldman is an exceptional writer, Rob Reiner is an incredibledirector, and the entire cast of this film were amazing. Cary Elwescaptured the character of Westley. Mandy Patinkin was an incredibleInigo Montoya. Andre the Giant was the most lovable Fezzik imaginable.Everything about this film was spectacular. I love this movie.
