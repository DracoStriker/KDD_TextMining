I like this movie. I don't think I love it as much as some folks do.It's an agreeable fairy tale with an enjoyably self-aware, slightlycynical sense of humor. When it works, the sword fight between CaryElwes and Mandy Patinkin for example, it really excels. When it doesn't... Billy Crystal, some of Andre the Giant's acting ... it just kind oflies there, but never for too long. It sometimes feels to me like thefilm thinks its' absolutely hilarious, while maybe it's just prettydamn amusing.
