What a movie! From the beginning to the end, it has an amazing storythat makes you enter inside this fantasy world and escape from thereality for an hour and a half. It tells us a story of love andrevenge, by the voice of a grandfather who is reading this tale to hissick grandson. It present us Buttercup (Robin Wright) and Westley (CaryElwes), two lovers who live in a far away land. One day, Westley leavesand he doesn't returns, and five years later Buttercup is turned into aprincess when she gets promised with the Prince Humperdink(ChrisSarandon). Th princess is kidnapped by three bounty hunters: Vizzini(Wallace Shawn), Fezzik (André The Giant) & Iñigo Montoya (MandyPatinkin) who is looking for revenge after his father's death. They arechased by a mysterious Men in Black who wants to capture the princess.The story is one of a kind, full of epic, romance, adventure and also alot of comedy, because this movie serves as a fantasy tale and also asan auto parody of itself in some parts of the movie, with many momentsthat can make you laugh very hard.All the actors are perfect in their roles, making you laugh or angry orsad, in the moment when it's necessary. And also I have to add theawesome choreography of the sword fights. They're simply amazing. Ifyou add to this the magical score created by Mark Knopfler you have anamazing adventure movie recommended for all ages."My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
