So, I've just watched The Princess Bride for the very first time andit's probably the best thing I did all week. The Princess Bride isn'tthe best movie I've ever seen, but it is so well-written that everyscene is so refreshing that you can't avert your gaze for an instant.I'm not very experienced on writing review, so I'll make myself shortand just say one thing... I urge you to watch this movie if yourlooking for something to cheer up your day.
