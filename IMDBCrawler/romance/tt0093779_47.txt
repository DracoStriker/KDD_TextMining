The Princess Bride has long been seen as a cinema classic and it hasoften been voted as one of the top films of the 80's, a sentiment thatI would have a hard time disagreeing with. As a fan of the fantasygenre, this film falls in my wheelhouse. Despite me probably likingthis film no matter what, there is no denying the talent behind thefilm. The story is simple, but sweet and written very well. The film isexpertly directed and well-acted. The visuals even do a good jobstanding the test of time. In all, this was a very entertaining fantasyromp about the quest for true love. Rob Reiner's film is about a poor farm girl named Buttercup who isforced to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck, but her childhood lovenamed Westley comes back as the Dreaded Pirate Roberts to rescue herfrom the clutches of the prince. The film may not have the most exotic cast in the world, but there isno denying how good they were and how much fun they seemed to have. Iliked Cary Elwes as Westley as well as Robin Wright as Buttercup. Andrethe Giant was actually very good as Fezzik, and likewise ChristopherGuest as Count Rugen and Chris Sarandon as the Prince. Overall, The Princess Bride is the film for all ages. It is the kind offilm that shall be passed down from generation to generation. As afantasy lover, it has all the elements you can ask for as you expectfrom such a film. I loved the theme about true love as it's a themethat will always be relevant. It's such a gorgeous film and one that isalso funny. My Grade: A
