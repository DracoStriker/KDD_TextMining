A gloriously witty fantasy film with its heart and soul in the right place-- on its sleeve.  All the performances are good (although Chrystal is tooshowy for my taste) but Patinkin's is exceptional.  Also features anendearing performance by wrestling star Andre "The Giant".  Special noteshould go to writer William Goldman, who does an almost perfect adaption ofhis wonderful novel.  Reiner acquits himself well, particularly through thewit and style of the performances (some of them from actors who have notdone work so good in the rest of their careers), but relies on close-ups abit too much.  Reiner should be credited, though, with letting the materialspeak for itself for the most part, providing fairly straightforward cameramovement and positioning.  Best scene for me -- Elwes and Patinkin's classicduel atop the cliffs of death (or whatever they're called).
