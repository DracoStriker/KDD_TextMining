Looking at this movie from a completely cinematic angle, one realizes thatthe acting is botched terribly by many (ahem, Buttercup, ahem), everythingis wholly unrealistic, and the writing is terrible; there are some trulythrow-away lines, especially by Buttercup.And yet, the movie will always remain one of my all-time favorites amongother such cinematic abominations as Rocky Horror Picture Show and FourRooms.  I have been watching this movie since I was 7, and I doubt I willever stop.  And to (duly) shower praise upon Rob Reiner's head, there hasnever been a buddy movie that has come close to rivaling Fezzik and Inigo'swonderful chemistry.  And there has never been a better, awful,movie.
