One of my favorite movies. Probably in my top five all-time favorites.Funny, quotable, with many memorable characters and one perfect sceneafter another. Just absolutely charming. Solid direction from RobReiner. Perhaps not as flashy as some would prefer but straightforwardand not distracting like it probably would be if made today. WilliamGoldman wrote the screenplay, as well as the original book. I've readthe book and I recommend you go check it out after seeing the film.There are a lot of little funny bits that didn't make it to the screen.The cast is excellent, from perhaps the prettiest couple in moviehistory (Cary Elwes and Robin Wright) to one of the funniest supportingcasts ever (including Chris Sarandon, Mandy Patinkin, Billy Crystal,Wallace Shawn, Christopher Guest, Peter Falk, Peter Cook, Carol Kane,and a wonderful turn from pro wrestling legend Andre the Giant). It's aclassic for young and old alike and I can't say enough good thingsabout it. Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters,chases, escapes, true love, miracles... it's got everything.
