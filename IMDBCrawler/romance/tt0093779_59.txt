Wonderful, heart-warming story. Basically a fairy tale, but with some20th century sensibilities and witticisms. Very funny at times. Somegreat, and quotable, lines.Rob Reiner's direction is spot-on. Never a dull moment - the movie justmotors along and you hardly feel the time pass. Good performances all round. Cary Elwes, Robin Wright and MandyPatinkin don't put a foot wrong. Hard to single out any, but MandyPatinkin's, as Inigo Montoya, is probably the pick of the lot.It's not just the main characters who deserve our attention. Some bignames in minor roles, and they all deliver in spades - Peter Falk, FredSavage, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, Peter Cook, Mel Smith.A modern classic and ideal for all ages.
