One of the most well-known and respected fantasy films and for a goodreason. The Princess Bride is a genre-defining film that has enduredthe test of time beautifully and still stands as one of the bestadventure films and the one film you should see if you're interested inswashbuckler films.What I like the most about this film is its unpredictability. Sure,it's an adventure film aimed for all audiences, so the good guys aregoing to win and all that, but the way they go about accomplishing thattask is what makes this film enjoyable. You're never sure what's goingto happen next, the characters are very creative and there are a lot ofthem, the plot twists come right out of nowhere and the humoroustongue-in-cheek tone ties it all together. There is drama and highstages, yes, but it's still an adventure film and meant to be enjoyedwith a smile on your face.The story develops rather erratically, going from one scene to anotherwith very few tie-ins, but in this case it works, because the wholefilm is told more like a fairy tale than a typical story. So it's moreof a preference of style than a flaw.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the frame story involving agrandfather reading his grandson a book while he lies sick in bed isnot as interesting as the actual story and sometimes the kid'sinterruptions in the story come at the worst possible times. This isonly a nitpick, however, because the banter between these two isactually quite humorous, which keeps it from becoming an annoyance.It'd be interesting to see just how well the actual adventure wouldflow without the frame story, just for comparison.I like this film, I like a lot. It has a strong story, it's fun andcharming without being immature, its characters are great, it has a lotof memorable dialogues and as a whole it's just bursting withimagination. One of the best adventure films I've ever seen and wellworth your time, whoever you happen to be.
