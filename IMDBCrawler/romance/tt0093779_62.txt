The Princess Bride (1987) directed by Rob Reiner, is the perfect moviefor all ages. College students love it. I watched it with my wife,grown daughter and her husband, and their two young children. It workedfor all of us. The screenplay, by William Goldman, is based on his book. Notsurprisingly, the film captures the spirit--as well as the details--ofthe original. The acting is excellent, in an appropriate over-the-topsort of way. Cary Elwes is fine as Westley and so is Robin Wright asButtercup, The Princess Bride. However, the really great roles belong to Mandy Patinkin as theswordsman Inigo Montoya, Wallace Shawn as the Sicilian genius, Vizzini,and André the Giant as Fezzik, who is, indeed, a giant.Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Carol Kane as his wife Valerie havejust one scene, but it's a highlight of the film Hilarious doesn'tbegin to describe it.No lover of movies can afford to miss The Princess Bride. It workedwell when we saw it on DVD, so there's no excuse not to rent it or buyit. It would be sad to go through life without seeing The PrincessBride at least once. (Several times would be better, but once is amust.)
