The Princess Bride is a romantic comedy adventure film based on thenovel of the same name by William Goldman.The movie features CaryElwes, Robin Wright,Mandy Patinkin,Chris Sarandon,André theGiant,Christopher Guest,Fred Savage,Wallace Shawn,Billy Crystal andCarol Kane.It combines comedy, adventure, romance, and fantasy. It wasdirected by Rob Reiner from a screenplay by Goldman. The story ispresented in the film as a book being read by a grandfather to his sickgrandson, thus effectively preserving the novel's narrative style.The screenplay offers a tongue-in-cheek fairy tale depicting stableboy- turned-pirate Westley's journey to rescue Buttercup, his truelove, away from the evil prince, whom she had agreed to marry fiveyears after learning of what she had believed to be news of Westley'sdeath. With help from Prince Humperdinck's disgruntled former employeeMiracle Max, swordsman Inigo Montoya, and a very large man namedFezzik, the star- crossed lovers are reunited. This is a delightfully postmodern fairy tale.It is a deft, intelligentmix of swashbuckling, romance, and comedy that takes an age-old damsel-in-distress story and makes it fresh.The Princess Bride has often beencopied, but never equaled.Thus,it has proved to be the benchmark forfairy tale movies.
