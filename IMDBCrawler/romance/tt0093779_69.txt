I was not ten years old when I first saw "The Princess Bride",far,farfrom it.And it isn't,despite hundreds and hundreds of pleas on thissite,one of the greatest movies ever.Sorry,but it just ain't so.It israther sweet,aimed at children but movie - savvy adults will enjoy muchof it. Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes get in some neat swordplay,RobinWright is very pretty if a little wooden.The rest of the cast ham it upto a greater or lesser degree(think Alan Rickman in almostanything).Along with Bryan Forbes' "The slipper and the rose","ThePrincess Bride" represented a late 20th century take on the fairystory.Mr Forbes used music and dance and "serious" actors,Mr Reiner ascript by William Goldman that worked on many levels and young,vigorousactors.I suspect it succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.
