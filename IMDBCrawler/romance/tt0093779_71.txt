This is one of the Fiend's favorite movies. It has all the elements ofa great fantasy, love story, action/comedy and rolls them all togetherwith care, love, and talent.This was my introduction to Cary Elwess, and the shining star in Andrethe Giant's life. I had occasion to meet Andre after his making of thisfilm and before his death, and he literally carried a copy of thismovie with him every where he went. This movie, to him, was more worthyof pride than his entire life's career as a pro-wrestler. BillyCrystal, who also starred in this production, became his closestfriend, and later dedicated "My Giant," to his pal Andre.Just a little history from a buff.This movie contains swash-buckling action and sword play, strong-manelements, pirates, princesses, castles, revenge, and true love. Forwhat more, could you ask.An all-star cast gives us all star performances. If you are a fan offantasy, this is a definite must-see.It rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.
