  A childhood favourite, this is one movie that I NEVER get tired of seeing.It's a very tongue-in-cheek fairytale story, with fantastic cameos by BillyCrystal and Mel Smith (Peter Cook as a priest who cannot prounouce his Rs ishilarious) and fresh direction by Rob Reiner.   Filled with dashing heroes, giants, sword-fights, true love, evil princes,fencing, it is a true fairytale at heart, but don't let that put you off.The sheer excitement of it will impress it into your heart when young, andthe great one-liners will have you chuckling as an adult. It is obvious thatthe cast had great fun making this movie, and it stars the beloved CaryElwes, who apart from 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' and a few bit-parts,hasn't done much at all.  Watch this movie and you'll have a great hour and a half.
