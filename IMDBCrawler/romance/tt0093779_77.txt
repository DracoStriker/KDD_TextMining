i have already read the many reviews of other users about the greatnessof that movie.but when i watched i found it strictly okay.its not morethan average movie.heroine of the movie is good looking lady.she has good screen presencetoo. scenes with child and his grandpa are the high points of thismovie. movie also shows some great scenery .but the power and depth ofa story which is the base of every good film is missing here. its morefor children.the giant played his part well.but he has hardly any linesto speak.fighting scenes are strictly okay.they could have been muchmore interesting and better. because of the restriction of IMDb i wroteit that lengthy.because they don't publish it until it contain 10 linesat-lest.
