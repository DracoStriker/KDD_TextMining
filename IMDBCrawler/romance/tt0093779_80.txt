We were pleasantly surprised with "The Princess Bride". This is a verycleverly written movie. Also, it is obvious that the direction and actinghad to be cleverly and skillfully done. The actors do not "try" to be funny.They trust the script. Actors who try to ham it up, even with a funny script(Milton Berle, for example), water down the humor of the scene. I foundmyself chuckling at many lines and situations. The casting is wonderful, andthe cast and direction of Rob Reiner make the time period work. Thisproduction took some risks, but the gutsy move pays off with a definitesleeper hit.
