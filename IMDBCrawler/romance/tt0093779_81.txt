The real question we must ask ourselves here is, what rock have you beenhiding under that you still haven't seen this movie? I don't think there isa more played rainy-day recess video at elementary schools nationwide. Andthat is really a commentary on how wonderful the movie is, because it isaccessible to children and adults alike.Do yourself a favor and actually LISTEN to all of the dialogue. The level ofwit is beyond so many films that are strictly comedies, and yet we also havea delightful romance and fantasy/action/adventure.Now, seriously, why haven't you seen this movie yet?
