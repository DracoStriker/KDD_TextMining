This is the ultimate family movie.  This film has it all.  Giants, swordfighting, a princess, a witch, magic, pirates, rodents and truelove.I first watched this film as a young boy, and can honestly say that afterall these years this film has lost none of it's charm.  It makes you feelgood from head to toe once viewed.The casting and acting is spot on.  Nobody was ever going to win an oscar,but the acting is camp enough with out going to far.  The humour runs allthe way through the film to make this a real belter of afilm.We can even forgive the director for book-ending the film with Peter Falkreading the story of the "Princess Bride" to his sick Grandson.If you are looking for a film for the kids, forget Toy Story or Pokemon themovie.  This IS the ultimate film for Kids from 5 to 95......
