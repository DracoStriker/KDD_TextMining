Just got the new DVD version this week, and watched it... memories ofcollege years, watching it over and over on VHS, came flooding back... Whatto say about this film... no, the acting isn't the best; no, the specialeffects aren't from George Lucas; no, it's not a perfect film... but, thereis *something* about this film... it takes your run-of-the-mill archetypalfairy tale structure, turns it sideways in a really fun way, and manages tocapture the heart and haunt you.Sure, the story is simplistic, but this film truly does get more powerfulwith repeated viewings. Recommendation: watch it a few times, then go awayfrom it for a while. When you come back to it, it'll get you in the hearteven more strongly. Or at least, it did to me... friends of mine fromcollege even used the closing theme, "Storybook Love", as their first danceon their wedding day.One final word about Cary Elwes... the boy is quite the looker... And hislines are quite memorable... "Drop Your Sword" scene in particular. And,whowill ever forget "As You Wish..." Shivers!SEE THE MOVIE! SEE IT AGAIN!
