this is my first review on IMDb and i never thought i would write itfor this movie and most importantly that i would start by writing anegative review,but i couldn't control my over whelming emotions,angerand disgust when the movie finished."IMDb rating 8.2" -i held my selfthroughout the movie by reverberating this statement in my mind.butholy crap...the whole movie ended and at the end i was like what did ijust see!!! i don't know what people liked in this filthy movie withpredictable story,over acting and boring presentation.to be honest i ama fairy tale person.i love such stories but this movie is a blot onfairy tales.they think saying these lines "my love will come" "truelove succeeds" blah blah along with prince and princess can make a loveballet.AGGHHHH!!! can just say wasted 720 MB of my download. those whohaven't seen PLEASE RESTRAINT!!
