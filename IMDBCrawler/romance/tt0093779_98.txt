Basically a fairytale sort of film with some black humor thrown in,that young children won't understand. I have seen a lot of fairy talefilms, and this film can be considered a passable entry in that genre.A grandfather(Peter Falk) reads a book to his sick grandson (FredSavage). Scenes of the reading occasionally interrupt the main story.The story is about a girl of wealth Buttercup(Robin Wright) who fallsin love with a lowly farm boy Westly(Cary Elwes). This young man, awareof the great gulf between them, decides to go abroad and make hisfortune and return a wealthy, worthy man fit enough to marry aprincess. However complications ensue that involves a certain princeHumperdinck(Chris Sarandon) who wants to marry Buttercup.Five years later, Buttercup reluctantly agrees to marry PrinceHumperdinck after hearing news that Westly is dead. Before the wedding,she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a Sicilian boss named Vizzini(Wallace Shawn), a giant named Fezzik (André the Giant), and a Spanishmaster fencer named Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who seeks revengeagainst the six-fingered man who killed his father. Two separate forcespursue them: Prince Humperdinck with a complement of soldiers, and amasked man dressed in black.Who is the mysterious man in black? What is going to happen next? Watchthe film to find out more.I do not consider the high rating people have given to this film. Ipersonally find films like The Neverending Story, The Wizard Of Oz andReturn To Oz, Conan The Barbarian, Krull and Paperhouse much superior. Thank you for reading this review. May you live long and prosper.
