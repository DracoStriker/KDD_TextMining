This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  From the opening credits,superimposed over Vanessa Redgrave's skirt sweeping through the wet grassand flowers around Mrs. Wilcox's beloved Howards End, through to the finalimage of rural bliss, the cinematography is perfection.  The costuming isamazing, the screenplay is adept, and the acting is stellar, to say theleast.  To have Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter, Vanessa Redgrave, andAnthony Hopkins in one movie together is to see a true synthesis of talent,not to mention James Wilby and Samuel West.  The scene where Leonard Bastgoes walking into the field of blue flowers is breathtaking. I recommend this film to anyone who loves Forster and who loves painterlycinematography.  Also it is full of the finest performances by all of theactors involved.
