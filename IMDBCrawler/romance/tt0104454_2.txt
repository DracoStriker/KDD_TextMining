...and I must admit that on the first viewing, I didn't get itmyself.I'm one of those relative rarities: a straight male that normally enjoysMerchant-Ivory productions. However, I disliked this movie on firstviewing(several years ago). In retrospect, I can see that I was not reacting tothemovie, but my intense dislike for Anthony Hopkins' character.I watched it again the other night and was absolutely blown away by it.Whata film! Emma Thompson won Best Actress for her performance, and she didherusual terrific job, but frankly I was more impressed by the performanceofHelena Bonham Carter. The style of the film is magnificent.This is a story (like most of E. M. Forster's) about the injustices ofclassdistinctions. However, with a subtlety that I missed on my first viewing,this film is also about karma (what goes around - comes around) and astoryof social progress. This film is set in a time when society is coming outofthe Victorian age and into the Edwardian. You see contrasts of the pastthinking with the progressive thinking all through the movie. A visualmetaphor is repeated over and over: the turning of cranks, whether it beona new-fangled morse code machine, a vintage car, or the wheels of amightylocomotive. I believe that this represents both karma and progress,forceswhich Forster sees as unstoppable as the laws of nature.This is an incredible story, and an incredible piece of film-making.
