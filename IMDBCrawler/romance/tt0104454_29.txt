Helen Bonham Carter and Emma Thompson alone? what more can I say?Victorian-ish drama at it's best. There's outstanding dialog and EmmaThompson is at her prime: innocent and naively charming. I have someserious issues with the plot, but that's just because it's done so wellthat I've accumulated so much hate for certain characters. We are metwith two families the Wilcox and the Schlegels. First of all theWilcoxes in this film are complete assholes, except the mother who diesearly on in the movie (don't worry I didn't ruin anything, everyonesees it coming).I didn't care for some of the turns that this film took, but this moviejust pulls you in with all of their relationship with one another aswell as the atmosphere of the film. Overall, this film has a great castand an entertaining story interwoven with drama. A great watch.
