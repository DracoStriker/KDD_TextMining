Though lambasted by a minority as a Merchant/Ivory snoozer, Howard'sEnd eventually inveigles its way into a thoughtful viewers mind withrather abundant ideas and plots about agency, good intentions in aweary/cynical world, passive cruelty, active cruelty, materialtransference, and cultural ascent, all stitched together in a story ofclass warfare, with surprising, sometimes hypocritical motivations. Noone behaves as expected; as with Thompson selling out her values inpreference to ascent; and the generally awful Hopkins secreting histrue, malevolent nature, while fate endeavors to correct it in aroundabout way.There is far more than most films provide to digest. And the ideas putinto play are far more interesting than other movies deign toinvestigate, and certainly better than other similar chatty, periodEmma Thompson films (Sense and Sensibility) which are fatal to the lifeurge. It's also superior to Remains of the Day (also with Thompson andHopkins). One can imagine a much more modern, intriguing film (notbogged down with politeness and high production values) with theseideas, but this is the film we've got; and it's fine.At no point can you guess where the circumlocutions will take you.Howard's End is a knot tied back into itself a half dozen times. I findits complexity extremely pleasing. Suffice it to say, this is 'FinalDestination' for the thoughtful set.
