The story opens in Edwardian England, where we meet Margaret and HelenSchlegel (Emma Thompson, Helena Bodham Carter), genteel sisters who areconcerned with the lot of the poor. When they meet a lowly clerk who isstruggling to get by, they try to mentor him but their advice onlymakes his situation worse. Meanwhile, Margaret develops a friendshipwith the Wilcoxes (Anthony Hopkins, Vanessa Redgrave), a wealthy familywhose country home, Howards End, will become an important part of alltheir lives.Based on E. M. Forster's 1911 novel, this film is an insightful studyof the social classes, their interaction (and lack thereof), and thehighly structured and restrained manners that ruled society. Thompsonwon the Best Actress Oscar for her role, but it really is an ensemblepiece and the entire cast is outstanding. The period is carefullyrecreated using wonderful costumes, sets, and cars and the photographyis beautiful. The script (also Oscar-nominated) weaves together manyseemingly unrelated characters and subplots, all building to anemotional conclusion at Howards End, which is the source of muchdesire, jealousy, and sorrow.This is a thought-provoking and moving drama/tragedy. Highlyrecommended.
