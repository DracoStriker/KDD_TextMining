Very lavish and extremely impressive production is the definitehighlight of this Merchant-Ivory film from the novel by E.M. Forster.The eye catching sets and immaculate costumes are perfect, giving one areal feel for the period.The acting too, is good (especially Helena Bonham Carter as 'Helen' andSam West as 'Leonard Baast'), but that is about the end of it."Howard's End" fails to impress in any other way. Although adapted byRuth Prawer Jhabvala (from a marvelous novel), the film is notwell-balanced, or evenly scripted. We never have time to absorb any ofForster's wonderful characters. Director James Ivory also fails to movethe film in any direction quickly enough. Still, it's a good lookingpicture.Saturday, May 30, 1992 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase
