Forster was an author of both sly humor and deep sensibility, and arare male writer with the gift of creating believable, multi-layeredfemale characters.James Ivory directs an adaptation of Howard's End, Forster'smasterpiece, focused on the intersecting stories of three families inearly 20th century London: wealthy Wilcoxes, with patriarch Henry(Anthony Hopkins), his wife (Vanessa Redgrave); intellectual Schlegels,with sisters Meg (Emma Thompson in an Oscar-winning performance) andHelen (Helena Bonham-Carter); and proletarian clerk Leonard Bast (JamesWest).Acting is magnificent. Hopkins gives one of the best (if least showy)performances of his career as Henry Wilcox: not a villain, but amorally mediocre man. He is competent and jovial, but also smug andself-satisfied, a person who has a sharp practical intelligence but,when it comes to empathy, is totally inept.Thompson deserved her Oscar as Meg, the moral compass of the movie,torn between her sister's idealism and the Wilcoxes' egoism.Bonham-Carter's Helen is an altruistic crusader, but also prone tohysteria. West plays Leonard a dignified, shy dreamer. Wilby falls intothe trap of making the younger Wilcox a one-dimensional, malevolenttwit; Redgrave's Mrs Wilcox is as an old-fashioned creature living inthe past and obsessed by memories of her old house, Howard's End.Ivory directs with flair: see, at the beginning, the canny use ofBeethoven's Fifth Symphony when Leonard, under a pouring rain,desperately pursues the kleptomaniac Helen who has stolen his umbrella.A perfect adaptation of Forster's great novel.9/10
