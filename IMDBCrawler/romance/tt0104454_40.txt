I believe that HOWARDS END is one of the great film adaptations of aclassic novel, with themes about the need to connect with people whoare different than we are. The settings, costumes, and the performancesare all marvelous. Emma Thompson is the backbone of the story asMargaret Schlegel, the liberal-minded and even-tempered heroine.Anthony Hopkins gives another magnificent performance as Henry Wilcox,the reserved and rather inexpressive businessman. Vanessa Redgrave asRuth Wilcox gives us a mystical presence that haunts the film longafter her character's death rather early in the plot. E.M. Forster'snovel is, to me, for British literature, what THE GREAT GATSBY is toAmerican literature. It reveals the nature of the English people, andseeks to answer the question, "Who shall inherit England?" Theshattering climax when the bookcase crashes down on Leonard Basscrushing him beneath it, is symbolically the worlds of romantic ideasand dreams he reads about and longs for, crashing down on him, crushinghim and his life underneath the notions he thinks about, but whichdestroy him, rather than saving and elevating him. It moves me everytime I see this film, and having seen it many times I never tire of it.There is much said here about connecting with others, about living lifein proportion, and about justice, and human decency in the classstructure of society.This is one of the best films I've ever seen.
