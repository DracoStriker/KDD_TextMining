This is the crowning achievement of the collaboration between producerIsmail Merchant and James Ivory.  A sumptuous adaptation of E.M. Forster'spopular novel, it captures some of the finest acting in any movie I've seen.While the impact of Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven," (which beat out thisproduction to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1992) has faded somewhat,"Howards End" remains not only a potent study of character and classstructure in turn-of-the-century England, but a strong dramatic andextremely emotional story.  It will endure, I think, as one of the bestfilms of the nineties.
