I cannot say, that I liked it very much. Emma Thompson was wonderful. Butascharacter I liked mostly one played by Helena Carter.***Spoiler***I have a couple of remarks about the scenario. It is strange, that nothingwas told above Jacky at the end. What happened to her? She lost herhusbandand all means for an existence. We were told about all but her. But shewasa real victim of all others actions. Also who was the second kid playingwith Helen? And frankly speaking I don't quite understand why Leonard Bastdid not take money. He was not a noble person, so he could accept it,especially if he loved Helen. I guess, that idea was poor can only bepoorerand rich can only be richer. Actually the script resembles me Balzac'swriting.Going back to Emma Thompson, you can really feel her compassion andgoodness. I was a bit sorry about her, when she did not go to Howards Endatbeginning of movie, even she rushed to the train station. Nobody of Wilcoxeven really apologized to her.Summing up I think, it is rather arty movie. It displays different shortsofbuildings and gardens, but for some reason for me Howards End estate lookslike a source of all evil in this movie. And by the way, sorry for myEnglish, it is not my mother tongue.***End***6/10
