I can't understand how one can state this is the best period movie of the90's. I even bought this movie because of this comment. I deeply lovedSenseand Sensibility, and I liked Remains of the day, both with Emma Thompson.Ihated her in Howards End. I couldn't understand WHY she married Wilcox,andhow she could forgive him for everything he did during the movie... What awaste of time.The DVD "spoils" the end bysaying it's a "triumph". I don't see where the triumph is. The only thingIsaw is that I wanted the screenwriter and the director to pay for havingspoilt 143 minutes of my life. If you want a really fantastic period movieabout love, watch Sense and Sensibility ! Don't waste your time on this...Believe me, I appreciate 95% of the movies I watch, but this one was oneofthe worst. Now, do whatever you like... But you're warned.
