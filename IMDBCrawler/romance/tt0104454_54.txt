The movie that made Emma Thompson not only famous, but a household nameand an Oscar powerhouse for much of the early to mid Nineties. HOWARD'SEND is a beautiful, extremely layered Merchant-Ivory production and thebest of its kind. It's complicated story, beginning with the friendshipbetween Margaret Schlegel and Ruth Wilcox, and ending in some un-neededtragedy at the estate that everyone seems to be holding onto for dearlife, is done in meticulous way, bringing every character, includingminor ones, to perfect life.There are times, however, when the movie itself starts to resemble avery correct drama that is too happy to pay attention to detail to thescenery and customs of the time. However, this is something the Englishcan do in their sleep, and only serves to place a social thermometerwithin the characters. It's keen as well in describing the character'smotives: the materialistic Wilcoxes thrown up against the morebohemian, devil-may-care Schlegels, who while lacking in money excel inculture and sophistication, and the working class Basts who inevitablyare the ones to suffer the most from penetrating the plot.Of the actors, Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins don't display thecharisma they would show in their next film together, THE REMAINS OFTHE DAY, but this is essential to their interaction. It seems to methat there was a need to "connect" even when Hopkins' character was tootied up in social mores and a sense of security to really do so. Ifanything, Thompson's interaction with Vanessa Redgrave is that of twosisters who have found each other, and when Redgrave leaves the film, alot of the light also goes, but not in a bad way. Redgrave's Ruth is apure woman, and one who hints at knowing she is surrounded by wolvesand would rather leave her estate to a friend.All in all this is a movie of grave beauty, easily misunderstood asbeing "too British", but a modern classic, and the best of theMerchant-Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala team.
