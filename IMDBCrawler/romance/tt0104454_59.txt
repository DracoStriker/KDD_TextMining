Merchant/Ivory give E.M. Forster's novel the Masterpiece Theatretreatment, and the result is an accomplished and beautiful-lookingfilm, if one that misses out on the psychological complexity ofForster's novel.Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter play two Bohemian sisters whofind themselves embroiled in the affairs of an aristocratic andbusiness-oriented family and its estate when the family matriarch(played imperiously by Vanessa Redgrave) dies. You can feel the moviehitting all of the novel's high points, and it's never less thantasteful and respectful to Forster, but the whole thing feels moredutiful than inspired.Also with Anthony Hopkins, fresh off his Oscar win the year before for"The Silence of the Lambs." Grade: A-
