Emma Thompson gives perhaps a career performance (I wouldn'tnecessarily known, having seen very few of her films), as MargaretSchlegel an upper crust female who's sophisticated, chatty, charming,and puts everyone before herself. Her character, Margaret Schlegel ,and her sister (Helena Bonham Carter, who is also quite good) findtheir future invariably linked to the Howards End Estate. Thompson isthe real heart and soul of this film, so incontestably real and human.This film, as I said is too long, overstretched. Some scenes could haveeasily been cut or shortened. It's the major squabble I have with thefilm, because otherwise it's quite well crafted. The visuals arestunning, there are many beautiful shots of the wilderness, especiallyflowers. Double meanings abound, I think it explores the idea thatnature will correct itself, and the obvious meanings of "blooming" inregards to love and family.
