When Leonard Bast couldn't catch up with Helen in the rain, I knew wewere in trouble. All he had to do was run. Then, when she goes indoors,he waits outside in the rain and gets soaking wet. Why not ring thedoorbell? When he finally gets inside, there is a question as to whichumbrella it is that Helen has stolen. Wasn't one of them wet? Helenturns out to be an umbrella thief, a fact that is totally lostthereafter. The direction of this movie continues in this vein -Anthony Hopkins turns out to be ridiculously rich, the man-chasingSchlegel sisters are portrayed as oh-so-upright, and everyone is archto the utmost degree. The major theme of the movie - forgiveness - istreated only superficially. The gorgeous scenery and photography hardlymake up for the movie's weakness in plot and character delineation.
