Although fairly engrossing this tends to lose its lustre after thefirst half hour which is roughly the point at which Vanessa Redgrave'scharacter is killed off. Ms Redgrave is the best thing by far in thefilm and though Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson just about keep herfrom actually lapping them she leaves them for dead. Samuel West ishopelessly miscast which has the effect of making him seem inept whilstHelena Bonham-Carter wanders about ineffectually as if waiting forguidance in how to approach her role. In terms of overall appearance,period feel, etc, it's hard to fault the film and the social comment ison the mark albeit probably lost on two thirds of the audience. A lush,well-appointed soap.
