Directed by James Ivory and based on the novel of the same name writtenby E.M. Forster, Howards End is a film about class struggle in early20th Century Victorian England and a social commentary which willalways seem relevant.The storyline can be described as the junction or the meeting point ofthe three primary classes of Victorian British society- the upper classof rich aristocrats- the Wilcoxes, the middle class consisting ofphilanthropic intellectuals- the Schlegels and the poor working classconsisting of people who have to struggle constantly to survive- theBasts.The film for the most works due to great acting. Emma Thompson richlydeserved the Oscar that she won for this performance. Sir AnthonyHopkins is also great as Henry Wilcox, the stern figure of maleauthority and Helena Bonham Carter is impressive too. The film has avery likable Victorian charm about it that you expect from films set inthat period of British history.However I think the screenplay is a bit faulty. There are a few toomany scenes which seem rushed and haphazardly stuck together. Due tothe rushed screenplay, the story fails to have a resounding effect thatcould have happened with a better screenplay.Overall this is a very good film with a socially symbolic storyline. Itportrays the hypocrisy of the rich and the helpless nature of the poor.However the film could have been a great film in my eyes with a betterscreenplay.
