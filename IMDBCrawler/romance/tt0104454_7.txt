Masterful performances make this splendid film adaptation of EM Forster'snovel of the clashing of the classes a must-see. Anthony Hopkins, HelenaBonham Carter, Vanessa Redgrave, Samuel West, and Emma Thompson fill thescreen with passion and vigor. One of the few good movies that does justiceto the great book from which it was taken. Lushly filmed and directed with,though sometimes a heavy touch, great vitality by James Ivory. The settingis beautiful, the period feel is very accurate, and the story has subtlebeauty. Watch for Ivory bringing out some interesting psychology betweencharacters, especially of different classes. He captures attitudes of thetime to near perfection. A cinematic treat.
