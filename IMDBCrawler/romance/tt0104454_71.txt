Merchant-Ivory film-adaptation of E. M. Forster's novel involves twoturn-of-the-century English families crossing paths throughout manyyears. Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter are superb as excitablesisters who somehow allow an imposing, sinister widower (AnthonyHopkins) to come between them. Costume drama is long but not too lofty,and director James Ivory provides some unexpected zest in hisstorytelling. Thompson won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actress; RuthPrawer Jhabvala also won for her screenplay. Flawed film may not catchon with every audience, though it has very strong moments, impeccableperformances, and a lovely production (the art direction capping thefilm's third Oscar). Worth-seeing. **1/2 from ****
