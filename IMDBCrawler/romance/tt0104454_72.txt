I watched this film a long time ago and recently revisited it. It isexellently played out by all the characters and the story is touching ,exciting and brilliant. Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins have such onscreen chemistry its almost electric to watch them preform.***SPOILER ALERT****This film is best veiwed AFTER remains of the day. Because Remains of theday is one of the most exellent yet frustrating films of all time if youarea romantic like me you will enjoy watching howards end afterwards tosatisfythe need of Hopkins and Thompson to get together.
