  I can't fully describe the tumult of emotions that this movie brings out. It is funny at the beginning, using some great lines.  Than it turns into adrama as well as a commentary on class, then into a tragedy at theend.  The performances are first rate.  Emma Thompson plays her character withease and grace.  Anthony Hopkins performance was amazing as well, playing asurprisingly cruel character.  The other roles are filled perfectly,including Sam West as a poor clerk, who tragedy follows.  One of the five best of 1992.
