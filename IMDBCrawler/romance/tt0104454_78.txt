Helen befriends matriarch Ruth Wilcox (VanessaRedgrave). On her death bed, Ruth leaves her ancestral home Howards Endto Helen who is about to lose the lease to her family home. The notehas no date and no signature. Henry Wilcox (Anthony Hopkins) and hischildren decide to burn the note and ignore Ruth's wishes. The Schlegelsisters take an interest in the poor dreamer clerk Leonard Bast. Later,Henry spends time with Helen and they get married.This is not my type of movies. It's long and slow and meandering.However, there is no denying that there is real craftsmanship here. Theacting is superb. The movie looks beautiful. It's showing somethingabout the classes in the era. However, I don't find the characters thatcompelling. The Schlegels talk too much. The Wilcoxes are too cold.Bast is too bitter. I can't really connect to any of these charactersbut the movie is still a masterpiece of filmmaking.
