This is a right boring mess. While we have some wonderful actors in thismovie, the end result is pure drivel. This is a typical English mannersfilm, which means that you will get to see Emma Thompson offering tea toevery bloomin' idiot who walks into her house, and then suggest that they"retire" to another room for coffee. Does every upper-class person inEngland have a seperate room for coffee, or something? You will also gettohear her blather on about every silly little thing under the sun, all thewhile making sure that her manners are perfect. Yawn.And her younger brother does absolutely nothing other than stuff his gobwith scones and crumpets during the entire movie. He may have been thatwayin the book, but it certainly doesn't make for an interesting moviecharacter.And there's the typical rich polo-playing snot Charles Wilcox, who like somany of his ilk think it is entirely in their right to pull out a swordandwhack some lower-class scoundrel with the flat end of it like he does toMr.Bast, who promptly snuffs it, which seems to effect no one...especiallyEmma's sister, who got him into all this bloody mess by pulling that poorsod's trousers off.Does the w****r actually go to prison for Bast's death? I have no bloodyidea, because the movie jumps around so much that the next thing I knew itwas five years later and Emma's annoying sister STILL hasn't moved her fata**e out of the house. This was a complete waste of time...if you want agood English manners movie, then Remains Of The Day is muchbetter.
