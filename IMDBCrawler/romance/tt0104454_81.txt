It seemed better back in 1992, and we watched it yesterday on a bigscreen, but we couldn't finish it. Acting? Superp cast. It's just thatForrester is too dated to be interesting. Great photography, casting,locations, dialogue. Unbelievable, or perhaps rather uninterestingstory, with Bonham Carter going overboard over the clerk, and Thompsonjust too too concerned about it all. A small story about small ordinarypeople, that does not carry the weight that would be provided by moreinteresting events, something different from everyone having tea andgoing for walks. Redgrave was marvelous, naturally. Color excellent, itcertainly gave a good view of what the Victorian/Edwardian houses andinteriors and costumes looked like. I think, unlike The Hours, thereisn't enough gutsy conflict; it's all too genteel. The book is moreintellectual and therefore sustains interest.
