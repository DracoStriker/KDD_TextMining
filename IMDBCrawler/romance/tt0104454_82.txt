I had heard a lot of good things about Howards End and I love AnthonyHopkins.  Hopkins was great, (as was the rest of the cast) but the moviewasn't.  There wasn't anything of real depth in the movie.  The lives of thethree families interwove and demonstrated contrast between passion andcoldness and their application to class, but it was all surface clamoring. Ultimately, Howards End rings hollow.  The vast number of links between thecharacters are far from plausible and would give even Charles Dickens pause. The social commentary comes from these links and juxtapositions provided bythe plot.  While it's obviously an element, the film never seems to bedriving toward it.  Criticism seems to come as a merely byproduct of therambling story, and just didn't work for me.  It was too obvious and feltham-handed.I know I'm in the minority here, but this one is nothing special.  Theacting is superb, but for a film that deals with class conflict better,watch Gosford Park.  4/10
