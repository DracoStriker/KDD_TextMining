I'm confused. i really like Emma Thompson. i have this crush on her fora long time. I'm wondering is this the movie she had a steamy lovescene in or was it carrington? the reason I am asking is because Irecently saw her on an episode of the late late show and she is closeto 50 years old and has the most gorgeous legs. but i remember her afew years back on the tonight show talking about how fun it was toshoot this movie and there was this erotic scene in it and i couldn'tremember if the movie was carrington or Howard's End. So if any knowscould you help me out? Well I would appreciate any other inputespecially about certain scenes in the movie if anyone knows what I amtalking about?
