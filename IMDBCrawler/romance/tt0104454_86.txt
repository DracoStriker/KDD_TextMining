That was the case for me, I found "Remains Of The Day" to be a beautifulandenchanting movie, that was not the case with this film, this film was anuninvolving overlong mess.  I could not care about any of the charactersorthe plot, because it was all so dull.  I cant understand why this moviehadsuch a different effect than "Remains Of The Day", same director, sameactors, but I think that film had less unneeded characters and was seenthrough the eyes of Anthony Hopkins' character.  I still cant believe howdissapointing this movie was.  *1/2 out of ****.
