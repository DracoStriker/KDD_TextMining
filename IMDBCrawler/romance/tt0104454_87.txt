I loved this movie! I swear, I laffed my pants fell off - literally!The best part is when all the English people are playing tennis, andthen anthony hopkins comes out wearing a gorilla suit, eating bananasand everything! I never laffed so hard in my life! No wonder theycalled it howard's end! On a serious note, Siegbert Prawer gave atouching performance as "man asking a question" - a ro^le he has wiselychosen not to repeat. If you want a good time, I suggest you go out,put on your own gorilla suit, and kick back with the good ol' boys ofHoward's Rear End! You might even want to eat a banana with it,especially if you mash it up with your fist and then smear it on afrisbee or a mobius strip club.
