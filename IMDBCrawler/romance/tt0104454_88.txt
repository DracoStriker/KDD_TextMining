I was forced to watch this movie in my Senior Comp class, and I mustsay that this was the most boring hour and a half of my life...Personally, I didn't think the storyline and plot of 'Howard's End'were anything to be excited about at all. I found the movie to be dull,dry, and extremely uninteresting. I couldn't recognize a significantplot, or a significant meaning. I did, however, find a very limitedamount of notable traits in the technical elements of the film. Thecostuming stayed very true to the time period it was set in, and thesets built for the movie were flawless.The actors and actresses, I felt, were too talented for a film such asthis. It didn't fit what these performers are capable of. The lightingwas very well done in this film. In one scene, it's dark outside,giving a feeling of loneliness or desolation. The camera then shows awindow, where people are eating inside. The bright, warm colors oflight through the window contrasts with the cooler hues of the outdoorsat night. This scene was very well done. As for a few other scenes thatcaught my attention, nothing in this film was worth remembering. Onething I don't understand is how this movie could possibly be called aclassic. A classic failure maybe, but not a great standard to whichmovies made since should look up to. That is what a classic is.Everyone looks up to a classic, and wishes they held the ownership tothe groundbreaking film. This did not meet any of my standards for agreat film and it should have never been released.
