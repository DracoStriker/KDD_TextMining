With at least 12 `starring actors' in character and supporting rolls,half of them legends or mega stars; this Tarantino tale defies a shortreview.  The different levels on which this movie works are impressive.Asa love story we begin to believe that the quirky `loser' couple isunconditionally bound together.  As a pseudo `film noir' we begin to careabout the fate of the central characters.  In the suspense/thriller/crimedrama mode there are plenty twists and turns to push us to the edge andpullus back just in time.  The action scenes are deliciously violent andunlikemost other films, this one gives us pinches of humor sprinkled in amidstthemayhem.   Even `the King' alter ego is woven in credibly enough to improveour understanding of the Clarence Worley character.The plot, albeit original, fresh and mesmerizing, seems somehow secondaryto the characters and the characterizations.  Any of several rolls couldhave been performed over the top by what seemed to be an ensemble cast.Butdirector Scott lets the talent go just far enough. Even the remainder ofthesupporting cast is wonderful; Saul Rubinek in particular does a terrificjobas the puffed-up/ego-feeding movie producer.  Hollywood missed giving thismovie and its cast proper recognition.With enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozenblockbusters, True Romance gives us the `best bang for our buck' in years.The Walken/Hopper scene alone is worth the `price of admission' not tomention the Gandolfini/Arquette and Slater/Oldman match ups.  This canonlybe described as a `wonderfully wicked movie' for its tantalizing content,smart dialog and toothsome violence.Put the kiddies to bed, be prepared for rough language, adult themes andgraphic violence and enjoy a `not for the faint of heart' masterpiece.
