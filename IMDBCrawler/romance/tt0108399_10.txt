After reading some of the other reviews on this film I felt compelledto write a review. True Romance is my favourite film of all time. TrueRomance was not a film that got dusted off in the midst of Tarantinofever and is not attempting to be "Tarantino'esq" in its direction.Actually this was the first script that he ever wrote. It was pennedwhilst he was working in a video and comic store in Amsterdam. Herented the apartment above- anybody who has seen this film will knowthe parallels with Clarence Worley. Tarantino was actually trying toget his work taken on at the time by some film companies and herequested Scott because he loved his early work. It is true that lateron Tarantino kicked up a fuss because they altered the ending and hecriticised Scott for making it too Hollywood. Clarence dies in theoriginal script! Anyway Scott agreed to make both endings and letTarantino watch them, Tarantino then conceded he preferred the newversion. The film wasn't trying to be Tarantino-esq that part was justthe authors input on the film which is not common when people aremaking films like Harry Potter as the author has no knowledge of filmbut it is very common when working with screenwriters! This film is themost romantic film i have ever seen, brilliant characters, amazingsound track, brilliant acting & the cast alone informs us that this isone of the best films ever made. Brad Pitt was asked to be a leadcharacter in the film but was working on another at the time. Pittwanted to be involved so badly that he flew in for a days shooting justto do 6 lines as room mate Floydd. "and some cleaning products" wasad-libbed! Just see this film.
