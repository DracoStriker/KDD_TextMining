QT wrote this film and it was directed by Tony "Ridley's LittleBrother" Scott and it is, quite simply, a masterpiece. A violentmasterpiece, yes, but a masterpiece nonetheless. Christian Slater mustlook back on this film with a sense of longing because he has not beengiven as good a project since (Churchill: The Hollywood Years,anyone?).Patricia Arquette is as cute as anything and perfectly fits her role.Call me crazy, but she really seems to be enjoying playing the"hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold". In fact, everyone seems to be loving thehell out of a superb script. The scene between Dennis Hopper andChristopher Walken is one of cinemas greatest ever scenes! The famouslyegotistical Val Kilmer goes almost unseen as Elvis - sorry, The Mentor- and Brad Pitts now-famous Cleaning Products line was a brilliantad-lib. Gary Oldman as the white-rasta Drexl is the epitome ofnastiness. Even Samuel L Jackson gets a high billing in the credits,but is in the film for less than 5 minutes! Genius. By the way, checkout the DVD extended/deleted scene scenes for a longer discussion oncunnilingus. It's hilarious.All in all, this is a collection of brilliantly written scenes, filledwith memorable quotes and held together by a sweet, believable andtotally mad storyline with a better-than-A-list-cast. Even thetragically underused Ed Lauter gets a look-in. Tom Sizemore and ChrisPenn excel as the cops on the trail. The weakest point is BronsonPinchot, but even he keeps pace well.My only regret is that QT didn't direct it himself. Scott did anEXCELLENT job, but I would like to see QT's version.QT to remake True Romance and Natural Born Killers: Thepressure-campaign starts here!10 1/2 out of 10!
