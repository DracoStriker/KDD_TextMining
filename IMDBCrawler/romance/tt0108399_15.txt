Something compelled me to revisit this film 20 years after I saw itonce before. I remember thinking it was just "okay" before, but everyone of my friends thought it was one of the best movies they've seen. Ialways meant to watch this again as I thought I might have been wrongwith my initial viewing and everyone else's praise of it.My thoughts?remain the same. It's just okay. The script and ChristianSlater remain the best parts of this film. It was interesting from alayman's point of view. Not as wild or inventive as Quentin Tarantino'sfuture scripts, but definitely acceptable.Strange how we can root for the bad guy, as we did here. They're notperfect, or completely good/bad to put in the plus column, but still wewanted these newlyweds to succeed.An all-star cast, perfect for movie lovers to jizz over, they do whatthey needed to in their roles. Unforgettable? Not really, but fun towatch as the amateur crime drama unfolds. Recommended for 90scrime-movie-lovers.
