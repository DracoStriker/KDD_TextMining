At times, 'True Romance' reminded me of David Lynch's 'Wild At Heart'and Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' (the latter came out muchlater). Even though there has been movies based on similar storyline'True Romance' has a lot of stuff that makes it its own movie. Yet, Icannot shake the idea that perhaps had I watched the film during thetime of its release and not seen the other similar films that have beenmade since, I might have enjoyed 'True Romance' a bit more. 'TrueRomance' is very much a pulp fiction itself (no pun intended asTarantino wrote the screenplay). It's got the hooker with a big heart,the 'nobody' who finds a reason to live, a fake Rastafarian pimp whothinks he's black, the mobster, the cops, blood, murder, violence,drugs....and there's enough energy to entice the viewer. I enjoyed thenumerous Elvis references, the wicked humour, the dialogues, thecharacters and the performances. Tony Scott does a fine job asdirector. Christian Slater is great as the likable 'nobody' andPatricia Arquette is brilliant as sweet hooker Alabama. ChristopherWalken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini areoutstanding. Fans of pulp fiction may enjoy this more than others buteven otherwise it was a fun Saturday night watch for me after a tiringday.
