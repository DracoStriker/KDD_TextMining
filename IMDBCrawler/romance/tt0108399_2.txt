"True Romance" is one of those few movies that has it all: Action,romance,drama and brilliant acting.  Not to mention TR has an all-star cast, butmany contribute their finest work in this film.  Oldman, Arquette andSlaterarguably give their best performances.  Christopher Walken's scene isnothing short of pure brilliance.  I loved him in "The Dead Zone" and "TheDeer Hunter" as well as his brief appearance in "Pulp".  I was happy withthe ending, and I'm glad it ended the way it did.  We've come to notexpectthat type of ending anymore.  This along with numerous other reasons toolong to explain here is why I truly believe "True Romance" is one of thegreatest films ever made. Period.
