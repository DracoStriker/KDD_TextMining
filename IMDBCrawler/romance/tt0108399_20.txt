This is probably the greatest movie I've ever watched and I've seen aLOT of movies!!! I am not a film reviewer, but felt compelled to reviewthis one... also this film has a bit of an Elvis/Kungfu theme and IHATE Elvis and kungfu, which is even more of a testament to this film!Quentin Tarrentino at his finest, we all loved pulp fiction, but in myopinion this film is far greater!!!! The casting is phenomenal, theacting is superior and the music just blows me away! When the filmkicks in Patricia Arquette is narrating the intro and it's like poetry!This film will move you! This film has everything! It's funny, sad,dramatic, dark, twisted and clever I gave this move 10/10, my favouritefilm being the Godfather it should definitely be up there in the top100 IMDb films! The Dennis hopper / Christopher walken part is a realtreat the scripting and acting is out of this world, in fact there issomething likable about all the characters in this movie I don't knowhow Tarrantino does it!!
