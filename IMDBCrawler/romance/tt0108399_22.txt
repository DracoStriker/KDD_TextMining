This was probably one of my favorite movies of all time, up there withCity of God. By far the most loaded cast that I have ever seen in amovie. By having so many big-name actors (though they may not have beenas big at the time) the scenes are made so much more important becausedespite being leading men, most of the guys are only in a handful ofscenes. This transcendence made every scene not only extremelyimportant to the movie's plot, but also very entertaining. It alsohelped to make the movie more suspenseful because being a 'big name'did not mean that that actor would survive certain circumstances thatthey might normally. All in all this movie was absolutely amazing andit is more than worth the two hours you will spend entranced by one ofTarantino's most masterfully written stories.
