The film was written by Quentin Tarantino, and it really shows with thesharp dialogue and crazy plot. The film centres around Clarence(Christian Slater) who meets and marries Alabama (Patricia Arquette).After Clarence goes to get Alabama's belongings, through a series ofmishaps, he ends up with suitcase of coke and they decide to sell it.This leads to a wild adventure involving drug dealers, police and movieexecutives.The casting in this film is amazing with Hollywood greats turning upand each one adds something special to the film. But by far the bestperformance is by Brad Pitt as the roommate of Clarence's friend Dick.He is on screen for a total of about 5 minutes but steals every scenehe is in. However every one of the characters in the film bringssomething special. The performances by Hollywood greats, includingDennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman all come so close tobeing over the top, but the incredible script and brilliant directingmanage to hold back just enough to stop it going too far.This film is a true masterpiece where everything just falls in toplace. The film is not for the faint of heart though. There are verygraphic scenes of violence. One particular scene involving a womangetting severely beaten. The perpetrator definitely gets hiscomeuppance though. While the violence is very graphic, as with most ofTarantino's films, it is very bloody but also portrayed in a realisticmanor. This adds to the shock and also to bring you closer to thevictims.I cannot praise this film enough. It is one of the greats that has beenoverlooked by many including Hollywood. Almost all of the performancesare worthy of Oscar nomination, as with the script. But this film wasoverlooked by all the major awards.If you are a fan of Tarantino films, or films with a good cast andgreat story give this film a try. I know people that hate this film,but I know far more that love it.
