For many years I was an avid Tarantino fan however I had no clue as tothe existence of the movie True Romance until it was introduced by afriend. I was immediately captivated by the movie from the openingscenes.The dialogue in this movie as with all Tarantino dialogue in my opinionis top notch. The use of normal daily dialogue to spice up a veryinteresting plot does wonders in this film. And as with most gooddialogue if it is not delivered well it is useless.Which brings me to the all-star cast that is featured in this film.Many extremely unforgettable scenes were present in this film inparticular the Hopper/Walken scene which provides humor, history, and aheck of a lot of drama. The Gandolfini/Arquette scene was perhaps themost intense sequence ever put on film. And of course Slater/Oldmanhave a very amazing scene with great dialogue and a lot of action. Andwho can forget the minor yet very inspiring characters of Brad Pitt,Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek and of course Val Kilmer as 'The King.'I was a little bummed the movie didn't follow the original script tothe T however I felt the film was a 10 out of 10 no doubt. Very muchrecommended.
