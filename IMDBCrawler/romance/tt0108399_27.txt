Even though he didn't direct it (but he did write the script), TrueRomance had Quentin Tarantino's trademark stink smeared all over it.Predictably fortified by one gory, Rambo-style killing after another(like, would you really have bothered to watch this film if this wasn'tthe case?), True Romance (a mighty grim, grimy, bleak tale of crimethat's as old as bones) was your typical Tarantino trash.Filled to over-flowing with endless Tarantino-type dialog (generouslypunctuated, for good measure, by the all-mighty F-word), True Romance'sendless array of quirky characters (that even included a trailer-trashslut with a heart of gold) babble a blue streak, but, typically end upsaying nothing in the least bit worthwhile.I mean, for all of the jabber that goes on, True Romance doesn'tcontain one single quotable or memorable line in its entire 2-hourrunning time.From Detroit to L.A., our delusional hero, Clarence (who justifiesmurder because Elvis Presley told him to do it) and his blushing bride,the flaky floozy, Alabama, are on the lam and being hotly pursued bycops and criminals, alike. It's the suitcase full of cocaine thateveryone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many peoplehave to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on thisjackpot.Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerableshortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott(Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearlyproved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could onlydo what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferiorscript that he was expected to work with in order to make somethingentertaining out of it.
