Great characters, great story, genuine romance all coated inTarantino's early magic. Gary Oldman plays one of the greatest mostbrutal characters I've seen in Cinema (all be it briefly). JamesGandolfini is arguably as brutal and brilliant. The scene with DennisHopper and Christopher Walken is pure gold. Clarence and Alabama areplayed to perfection by Slater and Arquette and their love feels real.Arquette plays, in my opinion, one of the big screens all time greatestheroines. I very rarely purchase films but True Romance sits proudly ondisplay in my Blueray collection. I refuse to reveal any plot but thisis a MUST SEE!! The late great Tony Scotts Masterpiece.
