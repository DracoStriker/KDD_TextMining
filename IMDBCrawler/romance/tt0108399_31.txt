I can't understand why this film has all the bad reviews? A masterpieceof a film and one of the best films of all time. Admittedly, itprobably would have been a better film if both written and directed byTarantino but it is still an amazing film anyway. The choice of actorswas amazing and the scripting was even better. A perfect amount ofviolence as well. This film changed my life for the better, as I'm sureit did for many other people too. A lot better than that Dead poolFilm, what a waste of time that was. Overall, 10/10. Great acting,scripting, casting, and brilliantly written.hgfhghgfhgfhhfgdhgfhgfhggfhhgfhfh.
