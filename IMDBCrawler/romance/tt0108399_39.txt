Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make an outstanding couple inthis film that had enough stars for several summer hits.Directed by Tony Scott and written by Quenton Tarantino, you know therewas going to be explosive action, too.I couldn't even recognize Gary Oldman, but he got all nasty over Slater- "He must have thought it was White Boy Day." He never expected whatSlater had in mind. And, guess what? Her clothes were not in the bag hetook! I always like seeing Dennis Hopper. he just makes a movie moreinteresting. I'm sure he didn't want to meet Christopher Walken. Hebrought James Gandolfini with him - a formidable pair. He shouldn'thave told that story about the Moors and my people. Gandofini did OKwith Hopper, but he should have never messed with Arquette.Wow! Bronson Pinchot, Michael Rapaport, Brad Pitt and Saul Rubinek,too.What an ending!!!! A magnificent script and a soundtrack to die for.
