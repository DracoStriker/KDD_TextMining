This movie is one of my all time favorites (Top 10). The story isgreat, the cast is fantastic and the dialog is unbelievable. The storyis about a young couple who gets their hands on a case full of cocaineby mistake and decides to travel to California to sell it.This movie contains some of the best scenes in motion picture history,especially the one with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, but alsothe one with James Gandolfini and Patricia Arquette.The scrip for True Romance from Quentin Tarantino is one of his top 3.Tony Scott, who has directed some of the best movies ever but also someof the worst movies ever, did a really good job directing this movie.I would recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it yet, andhopefully we will see this movie in the top 250 very soon.
