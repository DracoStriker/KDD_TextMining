OK, I missed this when it came out, so I caught the uncut version on cableacoupleweeks ago.  Basically, it's Badlands tinged w/ a little Clockwork Orangestyleultraviolence - they even rip off the marimba music from Badlands and havethe femalelead narrate too, only this time the couple is able to beat the law andhitthe road, andthe antihero's model/idol is Elvis rather than James Dean.  Tarantino issoooo derivative,skip his films and enjoy his source material instead (blaxploitation &kungfu films).  TheDrexel character is the cinematic manifestation of Tarantino's ultimatewannabe blackman fantasy.
