It's too bad about 'True Romance.'  Judging from the screenplay, thiscouldhave been afine film.  That is, with a different director.  Tony Scott is responsiblefor the mess thatis 'True Romance.'  He clearly can't do subtlety.  He doesn't know when totone it down.He doesn't know what's funny about the screenplay.  He plays every momenthuge andoverblown.  A stylistic choice, you say?  Please.  Take a look at TonyScott's credits.  'TheLast Boyscout', 'The Fan,' 'Beverly Hills Cop II.'  Did he mean to makethese films theoverwrought bores that they were?  That's all he knows how to do.  It'sreally a shamethat his brother didn't direct 'True Romance.'
