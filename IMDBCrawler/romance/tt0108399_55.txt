Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, GaryOldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L.Jackson, Chris Pennsylvania, Tom Sizemore and James Gandolfini are allin this film! I almost missed Val Kilmer's Mentor (aka Elvis), justlike I missed a lot about this movie.Get married to a call girl who was on the job 4 days after one nightwith her? Then, not be able to breathe the same air as her pimp andkill him? Get a suitcase of the pimp's cocaine and run with it? Whatwas Christian Slater's Clarence thinking? He should have just keptworking at the comic store and lived happily ever after with PatriciaArquette's Alabama (interesting name for someone who "is not Floridawhite trash"). But, then we would not get to see all these fine actorsbreeze in and out of scenes directed by Tony Scott and written byQuentin Tarantino.This film feels like Beverly Hills Cop meets Pulp Fiction ? sorry thatI cannot recommend it as I expected more from all this talent.
