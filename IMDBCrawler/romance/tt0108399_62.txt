True Romance is one of my favorite movies. In actuality, the onlyreason I ever watched it is because of Brad Pitt's character Floyd, thelazy stoner who sits on the couch watching TV all day. If for thatreason, I could give it 8 stars I would, but I think it's best leftwhere it stands.The movie is about a guy who works in a video store, and on hisbirthday his employer buys him a hooker. They fall in love, and hekills her pimp, and steals his cocaine too. They flee, and thegangsters chase. He tried to sell the cocaine to a famous filmproducer, and everyone dies at the end, except the man character andhis wife, the hooker.Now this is a really cool movie. Everything about it is just cool. Imay not have expressed it as much, but the story is very well written.I am not too keen on the directing, but Val Kilmer plays Elvis andChristopher Walken plays a gangster. Can't get much better than this!7 Stars
