I hesitated to watch this movie because I could not vision it being acrime movie with the name of "True Romance." I am so glad I decided towatch it through to the end. It had enough switches and surprises tomake you want it not to end. Once you get hooked, you cannot let it go.I really liked it because the way it developed and did not make youwant to stop watching. Great flick and you can tell it is a QuentinTarantino movie. With the touch of Tony Scott it is a perfect 10.
