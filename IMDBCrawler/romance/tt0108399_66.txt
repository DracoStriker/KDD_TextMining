Super satisfied to be directed to this movie and very upset I nevertook the time to view their earlier in my life. 'True Romance' is atreat from start to finish. Piling on an endless barrage of action,comedy, romance, mystery, suspense, and add any other element, thisflick probably has it without ever feeling too much. The script veryobviously projects Tarantino's influence, making this a treat to theTarantino fans. The acting from everyone that appears on screen isexcellent. If you have never seen this film before, you will see titanswithin the movie industry appear with such minor roles yet are sosatisfying to see. The film as a whole is a fast-paced roller coasterride, consistently entertaining the viewers with each moment thatpasses. The material within this film alone could fuel hundreds ofother films. A truly fulfilling entertainment piece.A definite recommendation here from Oberrated and two thumbs up.--Oberrated--
