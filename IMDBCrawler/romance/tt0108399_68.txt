True Romance is possibly my favorite love story of all time. This filmuses love as a tool to push a story forward instead of having lovebeing the story itself. We get to see two broken individuals be therefor one another and raise themselves up from the gutter. Not only thatbut we have a unbelievably talented cast in every single role thatbrings so much extra color to the film. That combined with the richcinematography of Tony Scott gives us a film that surely will beremembered as a classic in years to come. It can be rather brutal inplaces, but that shouldn't deter you from enjoying this stellar film.if you want to hear a more in depth review on True Romance check outour video review below.
