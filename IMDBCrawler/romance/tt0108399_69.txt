True Romance is a really great movie. Wonderfully directed by the lateTony Scott, exquisitely written by Quentin Tarantino and brilliantlyacted by the amazing ensemble cast that includes Patricia Arquette,Christian Slater, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt,Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini and manyothers. The power of the movie is truly the fantastic dynamic betweenthe two main characters, Alabama Whitman and Clarence Worley. Also, Ihave to comment on the beautiful and memorable soundtrack that thegreat Hans Zimmer composed.True Romance is a fantastic movie and amust-see for every cinephile!
