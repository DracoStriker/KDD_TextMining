If you compare this to another Tarantino flick (let's go with "PulpFiction"), "True Romance" offers a load of memorable bits; theSicilians conversation; Brad Pitt's classic stoner; Bronson Pinchot;Gandolfini's merciless beating; the absurd shootout at the Ambassador.This movie's full of funny dialogue - and with that, some prettygruesome violence. For me, it's not very cohesive, and once we leaveDetroit for California sunshine (when it goes overboard with thecigarette smoke and filtered light) it loses something. The first actis where the sweetness between Slater and Arquette really shines; oncethey get the drug deal rolling, we lose Walken and that cute couple andit's a standard Tony Scott movie. We get back to the romance at theend, but by then, I really did miss Walken (and Gary Oldman - man, thatguy's nuts).It's the loud and in-your-face style that I wasn't really onboard with.Some Scott movies work pretty well. Some really don't. This wassomewhere in the middle. And don't get me wrong, I'm not averse toviolence; far from it. But here, it takes control.6/10
