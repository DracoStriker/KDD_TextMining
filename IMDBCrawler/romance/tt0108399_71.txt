This is a great movie, a cool movie, a funny movie and an action movie.Directed by Tony Scott, one of the best (if not the best) action moviedirectors around, True Romance is the story of Alabama (Arquette) andClarence (Slater) young newlywed lovers on the run with a stolensuitcase full of $5m worth of the mafia's coke, which they intend tosell. But as the old saying goes, the path to true love never runssmooth and a battle of wits ensues between Clarence, the police and themob leading to a classic finale in this action packed film. As a whole,this movie works beautifully but on DVD it's even better because youcan access all your favorite classic scenes that unmistakeably bareTarantino's hallmark again and again. Such as the opening scene wherethe heterosexual Clarence (Slater) states that he'd sleep with Elvis ifhe were still alive, or the showdown between Clarence and dread-lockedgangster (Oldman). Or the showdown between the mob boss (Walken) andClarence's Dad (Hopper). Classic scenes indeed, particularly the onewith Walken and Hopper.Also some other great performers that make this movie as entertainingas it is, are: Michael Rappaport as the dopey aspiring actor(auditioning, of all things, for a one-time role as Crook #2 for anepisode of "T.J. Hooker" that is set to co-star Peter Breck!), ChrisPenn and Tom Sizemore as over-zealous narc squad partners, and BronsonPinchot is wonderfully whiny as a movie producer's whipping boy andgo-fer named Elliot. So I suggest you sit back, relax, and suspenddisbelief while you are taken on a very strange and very satisfyingride through a lesser known piece of the Quentin Tarantino universe.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.
