Just saw this film for the first time after having heard it about itrepeatedly for years. I really enjoyed more than anything the greatperformances from a really amazing ensemble cast. The fast and cleverlanguage often found in Tarantino movies is heard all throughout thisfilm. The plot and story often feel predictable and the unfolding ofevents lead to a conclusion that is relatively obvious from halfwayinto the film. I didn't find myself captivated by the story but I wasinvested in the smart directing and writing in several of theindividual scenes. Multiple scenes in the film stand out with theTarantino dialogue and interesting direction from Tony Scott includingthe showdown at Drexel's and the interrogation scene betweenChristopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. The closer the ending came theless the film seemed to engage me. Despite the story not entirelyworking for me, I really enjoyed many of the individual scenes. It isclear from the story and style of the film that there is an influenceof 70s cinema with films like Terrence Malick's Badlands, referencedthroughout the movie. If Howard Hawks was right and all you need tohave a good film is "three great scenes and no bad scenes" than thisfilm is definitely worth checking out.
