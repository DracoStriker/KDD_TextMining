I LOVE True Romance. Its a simple yet effective movie with amazingmoments and characters that make me happy to watch film. The plotincludes the classic traction twist and twirls with many minorcharacters who ultimately have a lasting effect on all the characters.Some people who aren't really important exude personality and charismaand makes the viewer want to watch a whole film about them (GaryOldmans, Christopher Walkens and Brad Pits characters come to mind).The film feels cohesive (to me) and employs funny differentiations toother films on similar subject matters: drug deals (the Dr Zhivagoconversation is one of my favorites), violence, romance, friendship,family, trust, loyalty are all important themes that are exploredthroughout whiteout a flaw. I felt invested into Clarence's plightthroughout and felt rewarded for my diligence and interest. Pleasewatch it and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.
