A Quentin Tarentino Masterpiece. I would have given this movie a 10 our of 10 but I only would give amovie a perfect 10 if their were absolutely no flaws at all. Thatrarely happens. I can only think of 2 perfect 10 movies that I haveseen in my entire life that would deserve that score.True Romance would be on that list if the ending did not get quite abit far-fetched. Other than that this movie is perfect!!!! If you likeCrime, Suspense, Action, great acting, and a great story. Don't missthis.Scenes with Christian Slater and Gary Oldman are unforgettable. Shortcameos from actors such as Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt(before fame), James Gandofini are superbly directed and acted. The true stars of the movie are Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater.They have wonderful chemistry and I cant imagine this movie made withany other actors playing their characters.
