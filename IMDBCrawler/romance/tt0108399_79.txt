True Romance Written by Quentin Tarantino. Directed by TOny Scott.Starring Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rapaport, ValKilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, TOm Sizemore,Christopher Walken, Saul Rubinek, James GandolfiniA very well done suspense film from Tony Scott and Tarantino. Thescreenplay has an obvious Tarantino feel to it, and the performancesare exceptional. It was not as flawless as Reservoir Dogs or PulpFiction, and at times the only problem was that it seemed a bit longand like it didn't quite get to the point. However the pace was greatduring the first 2 3rds but the final 3rd of the film was a bitstretched in my eyes. Nonetheless one of the best Slater performancesand a quality film. Very interesting story and intriguingthroughout.---- 9/10
