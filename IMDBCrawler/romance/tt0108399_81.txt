Here we have a movie that really had the chance to be great, and iteven turned out great to some extent. First and foremost, the scenewhere Dennis Hopper explains Christopher Walken his culturalbackground. It is cited all the time, but that's just because it reallyis one of the best movie scenes of the Nineties, and definitelysomething among the best ever to flow out of Quentin Tarantino's pen. Ithink , Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect in theirroles and their relationship, their falling-in-love is set up very wellby the script. I also totally dig this idea of really going throughhell for love. And for that matter, I think the title is chosen verywisely, it's a "True Romance". But as the movie goes on and introducesnew characters, it loses. Those police officers, Dick Richie, they werejust patterns of characters, not real characters. And some of theaction sequences looked a bit too smooth to be really exciting.
