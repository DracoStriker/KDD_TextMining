A series of very well written and acted bits, wrapped up in a veryentertaining Pop-culture Tarantinesque road-movie. The Gary Oldman vs.Christian Slater, Christopher Walken vs. Dennis Hopper, and the endshoot-out featuring Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore are perhaps the best ofTarantino's writing efforts, and will remain forever classics amongmovie buffs(especially the Walken-Hopper showdown).The movie is literally packed with big names, some of them unknown atthe time, but nonetheless delivering powerful interpretations.This is simply the peak of Tarantino's creative streak: witty dialogand pyrotechnics. Don't miss it!
