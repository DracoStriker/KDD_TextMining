Although True Romance is directed by Tony Scott, the screenplay hasTarantino written all over it, which is a good thing, cause the funny,street smart dialogue is the best thing about the movie, you could sayit's what fuels it.The movie is filled with cameos and great actors, including ChristianSlater, Patricia Arquette, Brad Pitt and more. But I really have topraise Gary Oldman as the crazy pimp in this movie. Although he doesn'tget much screen time, by far one of the best performances of all time.Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken also stand out in this movie,especially in a scene they share together. Oh and James Gandolfini isalso in this one.Like I said, the dialogue is amazing but I don't think the movie alwaysgoes down as smoothly as Tony Scott would have liked it to. It justfeels to me that the pacing is kinda off sometimes and the scoredoesn't help. This is a weird thing for me to say cause Hans Zimmercomposed the music for the movie, and I'm a huge fan of his, but Ireally didn't like the score to this movie, I thought it was annoying.Nevertheless, True Romance is thoroughly entertaining and it's a moviethat takes chances. It's not generic, it's not typical and I love that.One can't help but wonder what would have happened if Tarantino hadgotten his hands on the camera.
