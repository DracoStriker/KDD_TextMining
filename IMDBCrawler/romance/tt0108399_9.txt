I cannot ignore the influence Quentin Tarantino's script had over the styleof direction in "True Romance". The scary part is, if Tarantino haddirected, it probably would have been even better. The sacrifice he madeended out being well worth it though. The good acting from a strong castcompleted this great movie. Christian Slater's wardrobe however, steals the show. 8 out of 10.
