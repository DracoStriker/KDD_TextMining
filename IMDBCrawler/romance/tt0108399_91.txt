ONE GOOD THING: Quentin Tarantino's script is so vastly rich in itsmenagerie of characters and settings, that it becomes virtually epic inits scope. Gary Oldman's pimp, Brad Pitt's stoner, Samuel L. Jackson'sdrug dealer, Michael Rapaport's actor, and James Gandolfini's mobhenchman are just a few of the "minor characters" who show up to stealthe movie from its stars.ANOTHER GOOD THING: Although many feel this film would have been betterif directed by Tarantino, I would disagree. This film falls ideally onthe Tony Scott directorial time line, somewhere between his glossy,almost over-polished earlier works (Top Gun and Days Of Thunder) andhis rapid/frenetically edited later films (Domino and Man On Fire).Scott did, unfortunately, change the movie's original time structure,which was closer to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs; butthat appears to be a reflection of "Hollywood Money's" readiness toaccept change, more than Scott's eagerness to meddle.EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: Howard Hawks once theorized that a good moviefeatured three good scenes and no bad ones. This film features,possibly, the greatest scene in modern movie history without a heronarrowly out running a fire ball, nuclear explosion, or ELECTRICITY!!!By placing Cristopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in a smokeyhouse-trailer with Tarantino's dialogue, Tony Scott crafted the mostwatchable conversation in recent movie memory.ONE BAD THING: Time has not been kind to the film's two lead stars(Slater and Arquette), who have now been reduced to primarilytelevision actors. This, unfortunately, gives perspectiveviewers/renters/buyers the wrong impression of the movie and it'ssuperior quality level.OVERALL GRADE: A+
