This is my favourite movie, I've not seen it until tonight for 5 years,and I think it's a film you MUST watch every 5 years. It's a great feelgood movie with some grunt behind it. Alabama is very beautiful, andwith cleavage to fall in love with, Christian Slater is "so cool" youwanna be him. Great cinematography, lovely soundtrack, unpretentious.Just worth the experience! Annoyingly I must now have 10 lines to makethis a "proper" review - because I've said all I want to say, butplease watch it, it's a 1990's movie that stands the test of time, andvery few movies do that. It's fun to spot the famous actors in theirhey day. It's only 3 quid and a must for every movie collection.
