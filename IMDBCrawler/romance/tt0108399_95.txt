SPOILER ALERT Don't READ IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE MOVIE I love thismovie so much. It's so outrageous in terms of violence, but yet almostEVERY thing the movie touches on could be real, or at least eachcharacter is too vague in their line of work for you to say itsfake/real (Hollywood producer, pimp, mafioso, comic book guy,prostitute, actor, and on and on). I've watched this movie a 100 times,and the thing that really, really gets me is the aftermath of the finalshoot-out. Did anyone notice that almost every character in theshoot-out, is NOT a main character, but was fleshed out like a maincharacter? You got the Hollywood bodyguard screaming that he hatescops, the black cop who does that great acting in that 5 second scene'he shot me', the Hollywood bodyguard screaming "I need an ambulance,get me an ambulance", and Chris Penn instead giving him street justice"naw man this is for _____", Alabaman shooting Chris Penn. This movieis so machismo and over the top violent I couldn't help but burst outlaughing when Chris Penn says to his partner about the guy hiding witha gun on the other side of the room, "hey is that guy Italian?" as ifhe's ascertaining what has taken place, but then follows up with "Comeout you ***** guano!" I literally thought that these characters at theend could have their own entire movie, but it was so funny that thedirector thought to flesh them out that much.
