I first decided i wanted to see this film after becoming completelyobsessed with Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction is my favourite film everand i also loved Kill Bill (1 and 2), Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown,so i wanted to see true romance, which Tarantino wrote the scriptfor.To be honest i wasn't sure what to expect, as the name seems tosuggest a romantic comedy of sorts, but this definitely not a chickflick. From the very beginning you can see the 'tarantino-ness' of thefilm, the coolness, the pop culture references, the clever, quote-abledialogue, and although it lacks the visual flair of the films he hasdirected, this is still top notch entertainment. The main thing thathit me was the way i felt at the end of it. You know a film is goodwhen u are still thinking about it long after the end credits haverolled, and the thing i couldn't get out of my mind was the line'You're so cool'. you have to see it to understand, but i'd recommendthis to anybody; a clever, entertaining, iconic film that has the 'coolfactor' all the way through. Who said romance was dead...
