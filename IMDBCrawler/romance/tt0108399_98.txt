The Christopher Walken Dennis Hopper Scene was a 10 best all timescene. Those two great actors had never appeared in a film togetherbefore. They worked together again in 1995's SEARCH and DESTROY butthere was no way to recapture the magic of TR's pivotal trailer scene.Maybe someday someone will write a movie that hasHopper,Walken,Oldman,Guy Pierce, Christian Bale,Michael Caine,GeneHackman,and Tommy Lee Jones. Now that would be a cast. Batman Beginsdid have four of the above. And fans of the film P.C.U. know that Caineand Hackman appeared in A BRIDGE TOO FAR together, creating the basisfor a character's doctoral thesis. But I digress. Quentin Tarantinoshould get his True Romance/Pulp Fiction groove back and use the abovesuggested cast.
