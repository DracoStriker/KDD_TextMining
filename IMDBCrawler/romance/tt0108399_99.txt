Where do i start?The amazing cast in the movie?Christian Slater andPatricia Arquette making the perfect couple for the movie?I don't knowbut what i do know is that this movie was truly outstanding,ClarenceWorley(Slater)is a sort of loner who "doesnt get laid much"until hisboss arranges for a call girl(Arquette)to con him on his birthday.Theyhave a romantic encounter between the sheets and somehow fall in lovewith each other,and get married!Worley goes to Alabamas brothel tocollect her things,much to the annoyance of her pimp(Gary Oldman),heand Worley end up fighting and Worley ends up killing the pimp,he thencollects a suitcase thinking Alabamas possessions are in it,he waswrong,it was a suitcase full of "coke".They are then pursued by themafia and police,the movie finishes in spectacular style,the movie alsofeatures Dennis Hopper,Christopher Walken,ValKilmer,Samuel.L.Jackson,Michael Rapaport,Saul Rubinek,BronsonPinchot,Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore,an outstanding performance fromSlater as Worley and equally impressive was Arquette as Alabama,hand onmy heart,this is a MUST SEE.
