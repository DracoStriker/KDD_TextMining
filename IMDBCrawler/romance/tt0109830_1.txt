Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make mecry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. JimmyStewart in, "Oh, what a wonderful life," - yeah right! The Lion King,when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions inthis film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played toperfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooneywas to win the Premiership in 2007.I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, andyou'll see.
