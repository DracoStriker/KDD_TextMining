He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in ForrestGump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career byportraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character ForrestGump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscarwhich he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after SpencerTracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance isjust as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the filmof Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to dramain a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(TheTruman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(StrangerThan Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classicare Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated foran Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,MykeltiWilliamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford"Bubba"Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total ofthirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best FilmEditing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,BestDirector-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is onemasterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a longtime.Bravo!
