This is without a doubt the movie I have seen the most time in my life,and I am hoping to watch it many times again before I die. I cannotunderstand how anyone can hate this movie, I don't give a F*** if itstole an Oscar from Pulp Fiction or The Shawshank Redemption. (Bothsome of my favorite movies) Probably the movie with most undeservedhate, and I can simply not understand why, This movie has everything,and here's why. This movie is both heart-warming and heart-breaking, it is funny, sad,adventurous, and most of all beautiful, to not love this movie you mustbe the saddest person on earth, just meaning that I do not see howanyone can not look at this movie without tears in their eyes. I meanthis movie broke me down the first time I watched it, and it broke medown the 10th time I saw it. It is the most beautiful story about love,friendship, family, but if there is one thing Forrest Gump is about itis life. To see the life of this simple minded man will almost certainly changeyour's.The way Robert Zemeckis directs this movie is more than perfect,and is a huge part of why the movie is so utterly amazing. Without adoubt Zemecki's best movie yet, counting all the great movies he hasmade. The soundtrack is also one of the most beautiful I have heard inyears, and and just perfectly captures the movie. Tom Hanks almostcertainly gives his best performance till date, and Robin Wright justoutshines herself in this amazing performance. Also incredibleperformances from some more unknown actors like, Sally Field, GarySinise, and Mykelti Williamson. I don't think I can name another movie that has both made me laugh somuch and cry so much. I don't think I can name another movie where Ihave ever been so sad, ever been so happy, ever been so empathetic to aguy I know is pure fiction. But I think I have praised this movie longenough for you to get my view, so i am gonna finish by saying, if youhaven't watched this movie you have no idea what you are missing. 10/10
