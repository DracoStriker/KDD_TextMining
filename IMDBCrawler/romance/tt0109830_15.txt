Can't take credit for this gem. Even if I am her mother.Forest Gump: Movie review by JosephineSo, it's about this really stupid grown-up and there's blood and stuffand it's not appropriate for anyone else in my class, probably, but,you know, you guys let me watch stuff like this. What is up with that?And there's this really bad girl named Jenny, and I hated her clothes.But once she cuts her hair she turns good again. And a guy with nolegs, who was weird. He made shrimp, which is gross, except for thepopcorn kind. He got a lot better when he cut his hair, too. I likedit. It was funny. Can I watch it again tonight?
