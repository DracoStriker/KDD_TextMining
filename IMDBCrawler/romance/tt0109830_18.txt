Forrest Gump is a classic example of the sanctimonious garbage that peopleare willing to swallow simply because Tom Hanks is involved.  If the filmhad a more a satiric perspective maybe I could appreciate it.It begins appallingly and maniputively with a stereotypically SouthernSallyField and her idiot son 'FAUST' battling through tough times and meeting awhole lot of important people that real people like us will never evermeet.Elvis is one that is easily recalled.Through the remainder of the film we are supposed to endure oneimplausibility after another: Forrest meets the president, Forrest becomesaping pong champion, Forrest becomes a Vietnam vet and Forrest discovers acure for cancer! (well maybe that scene doesnt happen but i wouldnt besurprised if it was cut just prior to release).While people were going ga-ga at the way Forrest floats through life likeafeather (a pathetic symbol that is ridiculously used in the film), i wasseriously being sick.The central performance of Hanks is one that is truly embarrassing he isstiff, lifeless and codescending.  It seems as though Hanks' was studyingchildren to breath life into Forrest, if this is so maybe he should puthimself on their level rather than looking down at them as dribbling, prepubescent morons. The remainder of the cast similarly sleepwalk throughtheone dimensional roles they are presented with,  only Gary Sinise deservestogarner any praise here.  The lines that spew forth from the characters'mouths were initially praised as incisive observations about our lives -WHAT!!!   They are dopey, uninventive and quite frankly wrong.  "life islike a box of chocolates- you never know what youre gonna get" - yes youdothey are pictured on the back of the box.I would rather have a vital organ removed than recommend this dross toanyone over the age of five!
