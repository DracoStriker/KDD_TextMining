This is one of the worst movies of all time. It is nothing more than anexpensive, intricate jigsaw puzzle and none of the characters haveredeeming value with the possible exception of Forrest's mother. Hislove interest Jenny is a vile human being and at no time did I wantForrest to end up with her. The off putting message IS in fact that youcan be an idiot and be successful, and in fact suggests that it mightbe better to be so. The idea that skills that many people find sodifficult to master all come so easily to a simpleton like Forrest isoffensive. Its saving grace is that the book is even worse. I don'tunderstand what people love about this movie, which is vastlyoverrated.
