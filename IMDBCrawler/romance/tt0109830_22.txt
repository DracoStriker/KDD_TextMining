This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. ForrestGumpjust happens to be at every event which was important forUShistory the last 30 years. Maybe he was responsible fortheassassination of President Kennedy and Dr Martin LutherKing.When they showed the first landing on the moon I expected him to show upandshake hands with Neill Armstrong.Moral of the film: act stupid and you will become the richestbore in the world, act normal and you will be punished in every possibleway.Furthermore don't you think that Mr Gump is an alien from outer space?Nobody knows his father, his behaviour is robotic and super-human at thesame time and Forrest jr will conquer the world. A kind of one man"Invasionof the Body-Snatchers".
