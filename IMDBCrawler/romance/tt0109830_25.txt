Forrest Gump is a film that essentially decides to take a fictionaldevelopmentally delayed Southerner and insert him into several decadesof history, having him interject with everything from George Wallace'santi-integregation push to inspiring Elvis' famous dance moves. This issimply a history trivializing gimmick, that is repeated dozens of timesthroughout the film. Three things basically happen in the film; Forrestdoes something amazing, he interjects in a historical event, but boydoes he miss Jenny. This is constantly repeated as well. The message;that the wholesome, slow, never questioning Forrest is a hero while thenonconformist free thinking Jenny becomes an aids infected slut isproblematic. The depiction of Forrest by Tom Hanks is one note and mindnumbingly sentimental. Forrest Gump is not so much a movie as a onenote concept stretched out to a bloated running time. Stupid is asstupid does, and this movie certainly is stupid.
