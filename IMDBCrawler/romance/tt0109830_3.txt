What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion oneof the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure outwhat some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie whomake it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue thatit promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that "ifyou're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded,but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserabledeath." I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention todefend the government or anyone else, but I think that the politicalevents witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the wholesubstance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to themagic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seemsso incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary personwho does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that infact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,nomatter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an innersense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest isthat, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discoversimple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: hetries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's familymoney and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it,try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open yourheart towards that world. The brilliant humour, the hilarious yettouching acting, the special effects and the uplifting message aretotally rewarding.
