My friend suggested me to watch this movie. I didn't expect anythingout of it, just wanted to pass some time. After the movie ended, I feltlike I had never seen anything like this before.. It even made me writea review. Such a beautifully made movie, has got everything. Teachesyou about the power of love and innocence. Sometimes we take our lifeas granted and all we think is we don't have anything. This movie tellsyou how to realize and work with all that you have, no matter how youare. Brilliant way of telling a story of a young boy Forrest and hislife. Not only through the eye of Forrest, but a mother, a friend andgeneral people. The way your innocence wins over anyone you come acrossis exceptional, and all you will leave behind is love and respect.Magnificent movie.
