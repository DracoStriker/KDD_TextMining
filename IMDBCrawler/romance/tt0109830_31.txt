Spoiler Warning!!!! Forrest Gump is in reality a movie that covers aplethora of issues for example racial issues with the KKK and BlackPanthers, drugs, peace, war, and finally disability. For this review Iwould like to touch on the disability portion. I must first say thateven though this movie is mostly comedic it can still be said that itis partially accurate. In the beginning Forrest breaks off his bracesto help with his scoliosis but broke them off to run away from bullies.Yet even though he had this disability against him he still had theability to do it. So in reality this movie begins by saying that it'smore about ability. I can prove this point further by saying that hebecame a war veteran with a medal of honour and also managed to becomea millionaire and then evidently a successful father, even thoughForrest was put in the situation that was impossible, and even if itwas for comedic purposes it is much deeper, yet he still managed tocome out ahead. Mostly a duration of the movie it is asked if Forrestis stupid, now Forrest doesn't like it and even though he may have alow IQ he still manages to pull through in the long run. This is alsothe case for Lt. Dan, he is in Vietnam harmed in battle and winds upwith his legs amputated, later in the movie he gets prothstetics and isable to walk again, he also ends up being a millionaire because of hissuccess in the shrimp industry. It's not that he is in need because heis disabled but is able to help because he is able. So in realityForrest Gump isn't necessarily a film about specifically disability orotherwise it is something that shows how much of an ability you havewhether or not you have a disability from birth or war or some otherthing. It takes a will to do something and this is why I would givethis movie a 9/10 because of its uplifting story and some form ofmotivation to do something with your life.
