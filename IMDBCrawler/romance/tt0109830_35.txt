Forrest Gump is a heartwarming tale about a very different man who justwanted to fit in.Seeing his story throughout the movie made me think"wow,this guy was some guy".Forrest Gump was marvelously played by TomHanks who i'd only ever seen (well,heard his voice) in Toy Story.Ithought it was funny that he was telling random people at the bus stophis life story.I'm glad that they didn't ignore him.Robert Zemecksdirected this movie very well because it made perfect sense.I lovedForrest's confidence that he could do anything if he tried.It was sucha lovely story,it made me cry,and i'm not that emotional when it comesto movies.The supporting cast was great as was the set design and thepicture.Forrest Gump is fantastic and remember,life is like a box ofchocolates because it's true,you don't ever know what you'll get.Thanksfor that phrase Forrest.10/10
