The fact that a movie of this caliber is given such an overall highrating reflects the disintegrating state of our civilization. TomHanks, as always, is obnoxious and unlikeable. How this guy garnerssuch critical acclaim is totally baffling. It's almost like he didn'tcut his acting teeth on the immortal "Bosom Buddies." Oh, wait, he hasbecome a brash public believer in the impossible Oswald-acted-alonefairy tale. That always helps careers....To anyone that has a loved one with development difficulties, or hasworked with handicapped people, Forest Gump is a pathetic andunrealistic caricature. Hanks's voice for the character is grating andunlike any I've ever heard, in the south or from any developmentallydelayed individual. What kind of ridiculous accent is that? Even RosieO'Donnell's laughable performance as a mentally challenged person wasmore believable than Hanks.The plot is beyond preposterous. All those famous people, all thecrucial events of the times (at least by Hollywood historicalstandards), and this one very challenged guy just happens to be in theright place at the right time, over and over again. I love fantasy andfar fletched plots, but this is not remotely possible under anycircumstances.Again, those with personal life experiences in this area, know all toowell just how horribly the handicapped and developmentally delayed aretreated by all too many "good" and "upright" citizens. Gump seemed toavoid most of that, when he wasn't altering history. This film makes amockery of those whose real disabilities make every day a realchallenge. It's typical Hollywood, but even worse than usual. Maybewith another actor in the lead, who could give even a somewhatacceptable performance, this film might have been better.
