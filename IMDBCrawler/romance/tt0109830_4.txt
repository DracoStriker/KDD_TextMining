This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects andprofound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Likeothers, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've neverheard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should readthe novel to get the author's intention (I remember some peoplepreferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awardsgave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should dowhat you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in theend, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not havingexpectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) Sohe ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of thetime. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brainsto think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of ourproblems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, whichironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. Welove our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in themoment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything ispredestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It issomething to mull over for a long time.
