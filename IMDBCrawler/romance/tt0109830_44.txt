Tho Forrest Gump is a great movie i would have done some thingsdifferent, like i would of had a back story more on his father waskinda left out. Also we never figured out what happened to jenny'sfather kinda just briefly got taken out of the picture. where did he gowhat happened? It seems whoever wrote this was against fatherlyfigures, lutenist Dan was one of the only fatherly figures in themovie.but other than that this movie a great movie and i love it.Forrest gump should have won more than one Oscar and should be in thehall of fame. Forrest will go down in history forever my kids willalways watch this movie with the family.
