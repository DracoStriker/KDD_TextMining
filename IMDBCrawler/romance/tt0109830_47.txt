I'd say this is a 94/100 type movie, it sticks in my mind as somethingthat don't forget easily.Tom Hanks is brilliant in this film, as his portrayal of somebody whojust isn't too bright is spot on. There are also several lines in thismovie that are classics- in particular the "Life is like a box ofchocolates" line.I don't think it's a particularly deep film for the most part at first,because the story is quite simple. But simple stories can and are oftentimes quite deep- take Aesop's fables for example.It's a shame that in the back of my mind that I have to compare this toShawshank, because that's my favorite movie and they both came out thesame year.
