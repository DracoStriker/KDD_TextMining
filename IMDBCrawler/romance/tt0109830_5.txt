I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that thebeauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocenceand purity with others, including the audience, he also manages toretain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. Asa Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I couldof course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gumpendures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blendingof music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was soperfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty fiveyears of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American historyonly became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the wellknown chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remarkthat stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.
