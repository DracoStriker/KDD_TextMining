I am not exaggerating when I say that I have seen this film at leastfifty times. It never fails to put me in a good mood. I woulddefinitely recommend this film to everyone reading this review. Pleasewatch this film! I watched this film with my mother at the cinema whenit first came out and we still watch this film together, at least oncea year. This is the prefect family film, or perhaps a film for a couplethat wants to curl up with some popcorn. Tom Hanks is truly amazing inthis role, and shows how a versatile actor he really is. My favouritething about this film is how complex and well thought out the plot is,i often feel that writers and directors falter in their simplisticstory lines. Forrest Gump will never fail to amuse :)
