This film was an instant classic for me. They don't write scripts of this calibre any more, which is a shame.Tom Hanks is brilliant as the mildly retarded Forest Gump. The filmtakes you by the hand, and shows Gumps life and experiences, both goodand bad, in his own words from childhood to adulthood.At the same time you get a basic look at modern U.S. history. It is heartwarming and sad, funny and satirical. Cleverly weaves in somany sub plots and ideas. Yet doesn't use excessive violence or bad language to relate powerfulmessages in a heartwarming story. A story all the family can watch. A cracking film you can enjoy over and over again.
