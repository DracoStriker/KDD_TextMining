This movie can really show the ups and downs of American society fromthe 1950s till the 1990s. Each time a come across this movie, onNetflix or on TV, I just watch it, maybe twice a year or more. Foreveryone who'd never watch it, buy/rent/stream this wonderful TomHanks' performance. It depicts the life of Forrest Gump, a mentallychallenged man from Alabama and his close links through Americanhistory. The movie also covers the life of his siblings such as hismother (Sally Field) and Jenny, his childhood friend and lover (RobinWright). This picture shows the great transformation of Americanculture and society during Forrest's 50 years of life.
