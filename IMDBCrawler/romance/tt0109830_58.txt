We just watch this movie in school and I thought that this movie was sogood! I have never seen so good movie as this is. This is not myfavorite movie but I would like to put it one of the best movie of alltime list. Tom Hanks was good actor and deserved his Oscar. The actressof Jenny was really good too and I would like to give her the Oscartoo. If you want so see this movie then watch it! This movie gives mesome chills and some power of the excellent movie. Robert Zemeckis isone of the greatest director I know. Haven't you seen it? Then buy itfor your DVD or Blu-Ray. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watchit!!
