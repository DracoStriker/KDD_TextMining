One of the best movies I have ever seen - It made me realize truth andinnocence still lives. The love he had was pure. I cried watching thismovie. Also the way in which the story goes -the political element init -very accurate and nice. Also every character in this film100/100 for the director and story writer - Not to mention theextraordinary legend Tom Hanks....Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, GarySinise, Mykelti Williamson - every one has played their partbeautifully.If U haven't seen this movie - you are missing one of the greatestmovie ever made....
