On the plus side, I think I saw this movie for free, or at the most paid $1for admittance when I was in college and it was shown in the campustheater.On the negative side is everything else, most notably the movie's lack ofempathy for any of its character.  Every character, not just Gump, iswalking through this movie with no goal, no destination, and no clue, as towhat the other characters are doing.  Someone off-screen must've justshouted "move" over and over again, and then filmed the result.  Gump goeshere.  Gump goes there.  Sally Field says this.  Sally Field dies.  And soon.  The reasons behind the historical footage inserts is not to prove itcan be done but to distract one from realizing how badly the rest of thefilm had come together up until the inserts.Anyone who cheers for this movie must also resemble a box of chocolates -flat, consisting of cardboard, and soon empty of their contents.
