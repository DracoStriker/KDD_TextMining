I am sure there aren't many people who have never seen this movie.Ifyou haven't,make sure it is the next movie you see.You can't help but to fall in love with the title character.Tom Hankshas never let me down.This is a character that you can laugh at,crywith and feel all of his true emotions.This is a man who has literally done everything in his life,yet he is avery simple man.One of the 50 best movies I have ever seen,and I have seen a lot ofmovies.Maybe in the top 25.This is also one of the best family films I have ever seen.
