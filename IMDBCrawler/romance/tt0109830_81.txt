Forget what Rotten Tomatoes says. Forrest Gump is a high-end movie withimportant messages about not letting who you are affect what you makeout of life. It's impossible to dislike the lovable Forrest Gump, who'splayed by Tom Hanks in his best performance to date. The soundtrack iswell-composed by Alan Silvestri, the opening song being one of thegreatest songs in cinema history. Forrest teaches people that you don'tneed to be smart in order to feel, and boy did I feel the emotions inthis movie. I couldn't take it when Jenny did at the end, and Hanks isso believable and likable in every scene you want to be like ForrestGump.I don't have to much to say about this movie because it's a movie youneed to see in order to understand how wonderful it is. See it, and Ipromise you'll see how good films can be.
