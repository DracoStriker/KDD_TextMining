...and it is still my all time favorite. Every couple of years. I firstwatched when I was 9 years old when I was in China. It was really hardfor me understand of the messages the film try to deliver. As I growup, I have been watching this film from time to time, and I start tounderstand the history of African American getting equal rights in thesociety, the fact that Jenny had a miserable childhood and why she wasso rebellent as she grow up, and history of Vietnam war, John Lennon,JFK...etc. I can almost always learn something new about the film everytime I watch it. This film always inspires me to question my life. As"normal" people with normal IQ scores, we though we know what areimportant and what are things we want. We won't spend time on thingsthat seem not important, and be make decisions and choices based onthat. But for Gump, he never made a conscious choice on those importantdecision in his life: play football, join army, make friend with theshrimp guy, play Pingpong, running cross the country. He didn't chooseto do any of these things. Just like the famous line from the movie:Life is like a box of chocolate, and you never know what you willchoose. And the feather flying in the sky at the beginning and the endof the film, was the a prefect visual metaphor of this line and Gump'slife.
