This movie really is spectacular, with Tom Hanks in the title roleperforming it spectacularly. Forrest Gump, a sweet, little, simple manjust chasing his one true love, is such a basic idea for a movie, butis done in a way that is heart wrenching and emotional. By far, this isone of my favorite movies. Few other films really can compare toForrest Gump in its emotion and overall theme of finding happiness inyour everyday life, no matter what life throws at you. And so, I would certainly rate Forrest Gump 10/10 every time, for it'snot the most big-budget films that end up being best, it's those whichtruly strike a chord and bring out the joy in people that can beclassified as the best movies. And in the end, that's what movies areabout. Bringing joy and happiness, and creating and ideal world even inthe worst of times, for in the end, "all the world's a stage."
