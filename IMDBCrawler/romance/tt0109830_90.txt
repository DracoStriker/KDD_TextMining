This movie will never get old and cannot be duplicated. Tom Hanks hasdone a phenomenal job bringing out this disabled character from everyaspect never missing a beat. From childhood memories of bullying tojust growing up and trying to be accepted,this film makes you thinkabout your own life and become grateful. It gives you a sense of hopein knowing you can be somebody that makes a change in this world. Fullof emotional drama, action, and a little bit of comedy "Forrest Gump"is an all time favorite. Ten out of Ten hands down one of the bestFilms created. Watching this movie lets you see it from the eyes ofsomeone who wasn't born with the glamorous or perfect lifestyle. Ilearn and see something different every time I watch it.
