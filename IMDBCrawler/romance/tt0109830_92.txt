This film is incredible... And Tom Hanks is the greatest actor ever..Watched every movie he acted.. Inspiring movie.. That truly althoughlife may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates butthat we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don'tlike it. I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or whothinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing itagain. It truly is amazing... How can somebody say that Forrest is justan idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do?It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what hefeels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him,lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to bespecial about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he hasthe capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all theothers around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his ownlife, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodnessin everything he does.
