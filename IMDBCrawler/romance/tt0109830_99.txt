After my father did a course during the which there was quite some talkabout autism, how it works and such I finally got to see again thismovie that I had seen only once at a very young age. There are severalthings (E.G. /MILD SPOILER/ the fact that Forrest is very good at Pingpong because he's able to focus on the ball) that suggest that Forrestis not stupid and retarded, more autistic. Which basically destroys allthe accusations of the movie being a "Sentimentalistic ode to stupidityand ignorance".There are various things with which you can explain why "Forrest Gump"is truly one of the best movies ever. 1st is the acting, not only ofTom Hanks, but also of several other cast members, highlighting GarySinise. Another thing to praise is the music. Alan Silvestri truly wasable to touch with this movie's music.Some consistent criticism is driven towards the story. The fact here isthe problem with understanding that this is what they call "Modernfable", a story set nowadays that is meant to be touching and talksabout what happened in that time, similarly to "The legend of 1900" or"the curious case of benjamin button". This genre seems to not beunderstood by a pretty consistent number of viewers, therefore receivesa limited amount, but present amount of hatred.Then, when I understood that some haters of this movie are angrybecause it seems to have stolen the accademy award away from othermovies such as the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction I understandthat it's just unreasoned hatred. Go watch it, it's truly wonderful.
