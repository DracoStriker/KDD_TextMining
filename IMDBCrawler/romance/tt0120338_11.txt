James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, "youeither love it or hate it", I for one love this film, yes I know it'sgot a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotionaland beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this wasone of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant andvisually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour theBritish original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty closecontender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epicis a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate andLeo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this filmnowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever madealongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' isdefinitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfullyamazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone'seyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's hauntingscore that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simplyperfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful popversion. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifullyspectacular film that will live on.
