It's a crying freaking shame that this outstanding movie's rating hasbeen dragged down by small people who hate it because it wassuccessful. You should be ashamed of yourselves. When I first saw it I thought it was the perfect movie, and it's stillone of my favorites 8 years later. It's got sexual tension, action,social commentary, and the acting doesn't suck. It's even got BillPaxton, one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie. What's so horribleabout it that it deserves an aggregate 6.9? The only reason I can thinkof is this perverse habit people have of hating anything that makes somuch money or is otherwise successful that it makes them doubt theirown worth. That's just sad, and you shouldn't take it out on aninnocent blockbuster.
