Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am notexaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watchedthis. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it wouldprobably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight Iwatched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong onthat. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably everwill see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears bythe end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part wherethe orchestra played "Nearer, My God, to Thee" and the end when allthose perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack.This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and overagain.
