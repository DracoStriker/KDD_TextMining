Why did James Cameron go to so much trouble making a film that presented thephysical and visual dimensions of Titanic and take the human dimensions on a fantasy-romp of titanic-sized contrivances? There are enough historical documents and memoirsabout REAL people on that ship who had REAL lives and somewereactually very compelling.  So why did Cameron opt to givetheseREAL people bit parts and invent two shallow characters? Good acting and high production values go a long way to cover up a poorscript, and Titanic is proof of that with the Oscar frenzy that surroundedit (However, it was the first film in a long time that did not earn ascreenplay nomination and won best picture).  Leonardo DiCaprio and KateWinslet both did excellent jobs acting as did Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates. They all deserved an Oscar in light of what they had to work with on thepage.  How conventional, shallow and contrived does this sound?  Rose is inwhat is for all intents and purposes an arranged marriage, but she is reallya free spirit ready to fly away from her upper-class roots.  If it wasn'tfor her darn mother.  Now to make this issue even more clear, her fiance iscontrolling and abusive.  The decision is clear.  She has to fall for Jack,a fellow free spirit who shows her real love.  Alas, Jack must besymbolically sacrificed so she can avoid being drowned in her life and trulyfind freedom in the new land.  Not only are the mechanics of the scriptclear, but the story is old and tired.  Titanic works because it plays onstereotypical conventions and latent emotions; it does not earn itsemotional climax on its own merit.  This subject has the opportunity to beso much more genuine and powerful if only someone had taken the time to lookbeyond fictional romance and into true life tragedy.
