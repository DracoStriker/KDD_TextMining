I will never understand the common man, and therefore will never understandthe mass hysteria over this movie.  I did not care about any of thepassengers James Cameron took the time to introduce us to.  In fact, we knownone of the true heart-breaking tales of the R.M.S. Titanic - only thefanciful romantic tale of a spoiled brat and the only American in steerage.It is frightening to me that America embraced this movie without everlearning one bit of true history about the disaster of the Titanic.  5 willget you 10 that most of America believes there was such a jewel as the Heartof the Ocean.  We already know many fools clamored around the graves ofanyone known as Jack Dawson.  Most offensive, however, are Mr. Cameron'scomments at the Oscars without any regard for the 1523 lives actually loston the R.M.S. Titanic.  Life is not a movie, and love does not conquerall.
