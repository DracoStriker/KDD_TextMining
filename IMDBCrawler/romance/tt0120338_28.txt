Best film ever, most certainly not. Best film of 1997, again not in with achance. I have to report that while watching "Titanic" I found myself beingtotally bored by the stereotypical charecters, i.e Snobbish English,Battleaxe American. Cameron has also reeled out loads of cliches and madethem 10 times more boring. There is also an undertone of class strugglewhich is direly executed. As for "Titanic" being called a love story, thatcould never be said as there was no chemistry between the two leads and tome no feelings of love came across (James try watching other Oscar nomineeAs Good As It Gets for a decent love story). As for the tragedy that wasTitanic in the film I did not feel as though the tragedy was fully putacross and I left actually feeling numb from this glamourised dross. Howthis truly terrible film managed to get the Best Film Oscar is beyond me (AsGood As It Gets a much better and beautiful film) and how Cameron got theBest Director award is unbelievable although is unsurprising when peoplelike Martin Scorsese do not get an Oscar for films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Mean Streets.
