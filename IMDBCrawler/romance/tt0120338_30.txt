Watched it on the screen a few years back and could not sleep that night.Icouldn't stop thinking about the poor people who drowned.The plot was not as interesting to me until the Titanic started to sinkthenthe mood started to pick up.  i'm sorry that the characters were tooone-dimensional to make me feel sorry for them when they drowned,  Keptwishing i knew more about them before they pulled the plug on theeverything. . .I watched the documentary on cable channel then spurred me on to borrowthevideo.  The documentary made me cry more than the movie, amazingly.Watching it on video, I could watch the sinking bit 100 times, its thebest!I just fast forward the whole middle section of the movie and watch thestart and ending.  I can truly imagine myself sinking with the thousandplusdesperate people, the special effects are truly convincing and fabulous!Icheered for the single lifeboat which went back and wonder what were thereal stories of the 6 people whom they rescued?I'm very interested in discovering the stories of all the survivors andwhatreally happened to the people who were on the Titanic because of thismovie's attempts to recreate that fatal night.  Thank you!
