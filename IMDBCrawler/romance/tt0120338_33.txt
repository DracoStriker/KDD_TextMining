Even though some of the actual events did not occur in reality asportrayed in the film, I feel as if the film portrayed the events tothe best of their ability. I thought that the film did a good job ofdisplaying the hardships and diversity between social classes. Thecharacter's interactions and emotions about the situations andconflicts they were faced with were also depicted well. LeonardoDiCaprio (one of my favorite actors) and Kate Winslet play amazingroles as Jack and Rose, and they do it justice! The connection andrelationship between the two is a story in itself within the film aswell as the ship's tragedy.As a young girl I watched this movie many many times with mygrandmother. After watching it so much I became obsessed with learningabout the Titanic. To this day I still enjoy doing research about theactual ship, the people aboard, the engineers who built the ship, theaccident, the aftermath, and what is still being found in the bottom ofthe Atlantic. Eve since I was young I have loved The Titanic. I hopeyou do too!!
