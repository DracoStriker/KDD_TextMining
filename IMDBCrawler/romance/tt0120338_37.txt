When I saw "Titanic," I thought it was vaguely entertaining, and thecostumes and special effects were beautiful. However, I didn't leave thetheatre discussing it with my friends, and I didn't feel or think anydifferently than three and a half hours earlier. Then I heard it had beennominated for numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and I wasoutraged.Not surprisingly, this big-budget piece of recycled Hollywood trashwon, even against three of its wonderful competitors, "L.A. Confidential,""As Good as it Gets," and "Good Will Hunting." The first has plenty ofinteresting plot twists and amazing performances, the second gives a freshand cynically humorous look at romance, and the third helped ME realize somethings about myself, at least.  "Titanic" did nothing like that.The screenplay was something that had been done dozens and dozens oftimes before, and as far back as the Elizabethan era, as the ludicrous,'Romeo & Juliet'-esque romance will prove. The performances, even by suchnormally-wonderful actors as Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, and Kate Winslet wereeither dry, or over-done. I imagine that if one had to 'listen' to thismovie  rather than have the dialogue and music (which is pretty at parts,but just a repeat of many of Horner's other scores) accompany the prettyimages, it would be completely unbearable.
