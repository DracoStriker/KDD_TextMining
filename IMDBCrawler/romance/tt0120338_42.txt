The movie had absolutely nothing to do with the Titanic. It was a lovestory. The Titanic was simply a backdrop for the theme. I was sorelydisappointed. To me it was disrespectful of the people who lost theirlives on that ship.As for the acting, Leonardo DeCaprio was quite amateurish andunconvincing. The "villain" acting was about as convincing as WilliamShatner in the Star Trek series. The only acting in the movie thatwarrants any applause is the old lady reminiscing about the disaster.She was convincing but had a very minor part.Attention to detail in the special effects was awesome. Few moviescapture this detail.I would rather have seen historically accurate portrayals of severalnotable passengers including the captain and people involved in thecatastrophe. Shame on the producers for trivializing such an event witha love story.The best movie of that year went totally unnoticed because it wasproduced by a small Canandian company. The Red Violin was the bestmovie that year. It was more than entertainment. It had a redeemingmessage.
