This movie was the most disappointing case of over-hype ever! Could aplot be any flimsier? Could characters be ANY more cardboard? Could youimagine a more pathetic excuse for "chemistry?" Imagine every cliché EVER CONCEIVED, combine them with a big shipsinking on a zillion dollar special effects budget, throw inpseudo-diva Celine Dion's lame tune and you've got "Titanic."God, I wanted Leonardo to die! He's the overdone tragic poor boy"artist" (this gives him an excuse for the drawn-out (no pun intended!)gratuitous nude portrait scene of Kate Winslet later - really. That'sthe only reason he's an "artist").)All the rich people are bad! (Except her, of course. She's supposed tobe redeemed from her wealth by her "love??" for him.) But there's zerochemistry - nudity and (God, how tacky!) fogged-up windows.Consequently, all the poor people are good!Thank you, Titanic, for simplifying the goodness or badness of anygiven individual simply by their financial statuses!I wanted everyone to die. It's the only way to justify the lost hoursof my life that went into viewing this pathetic work of pseudo-art?Lifetimey "based on true incidents" crap.Really, don't bother. It's not a timeless classic; it's dumbed-downfaux romance in the midst of tragedy drivel. Spend money on the script,not the special effects, for God's sake! This is worse than a Lifetimemovie of the week. I've seen after-school specials with more depth.Infomercials, even!
