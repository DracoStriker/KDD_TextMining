I enjoyed watching this film. The visuals were good and the depictionof the sinking itself is good. But throughout, the film, and especiallythrough the cheesy romance scenes, I couldn't help but think, "therewere 2200 people aboard the ship. Shouldn't at least ONE of them have amovie worthy story? It was a tragic night/morning, so why would MrCameron need to make a fake story when he could find an actualsurvivors story." A thing it did right was the humanization of thedisaster. When they focused on a non jack/rose character, I.e a realperson like Captian Smith or Andrews or the Strausses and especiallythe band, the result was great. I don't consider myself a manly man,but normally I don't show much sadness for movies. However, I teared upa couple of times during the film (not during jacks death). The partsI'm talking about are the "Nearer My God, To Thee" scene and rose'sheaven. But there is a very good reason DiCaprio didn't win an Oscarfor this. HE AND WINSELT'S ACTING WAS BAD! It was just plain wooden atbest. And don't get me started on jack didn't have to die. I agree. Yesthe panel (ITS NOT A DOOR) could of held both of them, but only afterthey put the life preserver under the panel to improve buoyancy. ButI'm going further back than that. ROSE WAS ON A FKING LIFEBOAT! THEREWOULD BE 1500 PEOPLE ONBOARD WHO WOULD KILL FOR A LIFEBOAT SPOT! ANDSHE HOPS BACK ON THE BLOODY SHIP! WHAT DOES JACK SAY RIGHT AFTER!?"You're so stupid Rose!" YEAH, YOU ARE! BUT OLD ROSE BEING OLD ROSEDoesn't REALIZE THAT KILLS JACK!!!! OK, now that that's done, it was amediocre movie at best.
