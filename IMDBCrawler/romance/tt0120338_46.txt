The tragedy here was the fact that they took what could have been a greatfilm/story and turned it into a typical piece of Hollywood Crud!  Seriously,the acting totally sucked!  The screenplay was trite and boring.  Thecontrived scenes with the old Rose (not to mention with all the othercharacters) were so sad, this piece of garbage could only come from smallminds that merely used a bunch of special effects to mask the poorly writtenscript!  Sad, Sad, Sad.........  I know that I'm certainly not in themajority on this one, obviously by the actual take on boxoffice and videorental/sales, but I know that I can tell good acting from affected,contrived, crud - and this certainly was full of the latter!  BestPicture?!?!?!?!  Honestly, the "Academy" bowed to box office sales andcertainly not to their consciences on rewarding quality film making oracting.... Sad, Sad, Sad!!!!!
