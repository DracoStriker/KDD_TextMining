Too bad about the cheesy special effects- at least the storyline andactingwere good. I firmly believe this film winning best film is the most unjustoccurrence at the academy awards, along with CITIZEN KANE not winning bestpicture, and Marlon Brando for best actor in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. Thescreenplay and the acting are the most important aspects of any film, andsince Titanic was deficient in both areas it should not have received thehonour of best film. Granted, the special effects are wonderous and shouldbe honoured, but as a whole the film was not a masterpiece, it did notinspire, and they took far too long to die. There were far better films in1997, due to their superior screenplay and acting talent, but they weresnubbed because of this. It really makes one question the credibility oftheacademy.
