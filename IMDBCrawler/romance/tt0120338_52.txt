I went to see the film not knowing what to expect. I'm not a fan of romanticfilms but everyone had been recommending the film so I went and I have tosay it is amazing. An emotional mix of watching while knowing. As Jack andRose get increasingly closer you know the fate that awaits and it starts youthinking of ways they could have avoided it. It's one of those films thatremains close to your heart forever.Excellent acting from the whole cast, especially DiCaprio and Winslet. Somescenes which come to mind include the dining room scene, Rose communicatesto Jack on a level that the other actors don't even sense, a sentence whichis echoed on page 95 of "James Camerons Titanic" It is a film that will haveyou hooked and on the edge of your seats. The length helps you to really getto know the charecters and connect with them and I hate to admit it but thisfilm has turned me into an addict.I had never heard of James Cameron as much as I do now and I'd just like tosay GOOD JOB!!
