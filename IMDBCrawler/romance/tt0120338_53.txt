Can I just say that Kate Winslet is magnificent in her portrayal of Rose.The emotions she shows in her facial expressions and pitch and tone of voiceare something to behold. Billy Zane as the dastardly Cal is also quitesuperb. Well done to all concerned on the movie, and I wait with eageranticipation for the Directors Cut on Video.
