"In every age mankind attempts to fabricate great works at oncemagnificent and impossible" - Titanic the musical Like the Titanicitself, this movie is a masterpiece that stands the age of time. Itgives me the shivers every time I watch it. I love this film not forthe love story but for the depiction of every passenger on board. Yousee the hopefulness in every one when boarding, not knowing what awaitsahead. And you see the tragic horrors unfold as the Titanic sunk.Cameron portrayed the human condition when everyone fights to surviveand the social differences very well.Considering this is a 1997 film, it's still better than a lot of newfilms today, both story-wise and special effects wise.
