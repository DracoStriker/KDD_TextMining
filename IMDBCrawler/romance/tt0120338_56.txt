The work done off screen was completely worth it. I suggest you checkthe trivia of the movie to understand that this movie deserves all theOscars it got and more. It is a timeless movie, with strong acting.I've heard people complain bout the acting of the main actors, butwithout strong acting the movie would have never succeeded as much asit did. Leonardo DiCaprio was born for the role of Jack Dawson, hemakes the audience fall in love with him rapidly, and not just becauseof his looks. Kate Winslet represents well the role of a young girl inneed of freedom. Everything about the movie was outstanding. Thesetting is a very similar replica too the actual RMS Titanic. It isvery realistic since several characters did in fact exist. The specialeffect are great, seeing in 3D must be quite the experience. The music,My Heart Will Go On, also one of my favorite songs. I don't believethere is anything bad to say other than "Why did Jack have to die?couldn't they write a happy ending? why make people sad when you havethe power to make them cry of joy instead? I love you Jack! Rose don'tlet go of Jack!" Once you overcome the extreme feeling of sadness andanger because Jack was too nice and died, you realize that the movie isamazing. PERFECT in every sense of the word.
