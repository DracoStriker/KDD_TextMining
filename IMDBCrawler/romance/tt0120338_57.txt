When I was in university, I remember seeing "Jurassic Park", anddiscussingit with a friend.  I commented on the loose plot, the silly dialogue, andthe fact that it was a poor adaptation of a fairly entertaining novel.Myfriend's comment was, "Yeah, but DUDE, you got to watch DINOSAURS!"  Trueenough, and for that, the film was well worth the cash."Titanic" is much the same.  The plot is the same old stuff you've seenbefore - poor boy meets rich girl promised to rich boy, rich girl fallsforpoor boy, rich boy tries to get rid of both.  Think "Caddyshack" on aboat.The acting is OK, given the silly dialogue and relentless attempts attugging your heartstrings.  Here's the kicker: you get to see the ship godown.  In the comfort of your stadium seat or in your own home, you gettosee what looks like the actual sinking of an ocean liner.  Peoplescreaming,tonnes of water everywhere, the best and worst of mankind in a tidypackagefor your viewing pleasure.  It's FRICKIN' COOL, is what it is.  It's someofthe best eye-candy ever seen on film, and that's saying alot.Remember DiCaprio's wonderful performances in "What's Eating GilbertGrape?"or "The Basketball Diaries"?  Yeah, you won't see any of that in"Titanic"."Titanic" is less a movie than it is a rollercoaster.  I liken it to"PearlHarbor" or "Debbie Does Dallas", where you get to see some mind-blowingaction sequences, and the rest of the film is useless.  Rent the DVD soyoucan use chapter-select to replay the good stuff over andover.Now, you might be thinking I'm a mindless action freak, but nothing isfurther from the truth.  For those of you that heard "Titanic" is awonderful and romantic flick, I recommend watching it, then renting"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" or "The English Patient".  Both thesefilmshave better dialogue, better acting, and are MUCH more romantic than"Titanic" can ever be.Oh yeah, I almost forgot: two good reasons to watch "Titanic": KateWinsletgets topless.
