It isn't that this film is bad.  It would be good if it didn't receive allthe hype that it got.  Why in the world would it win Best Picture Oscar.That should have went to L.A. Confidential or As Good As It Gets.  I doenjoy Kathy Bates in everything I see and Kate Winslet was all right.  ButJames Cameron's cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomedship was just a way to sell tickets, and adding "DiCraprio" was just icingon the cake for him.  If you like good movies, rent "Boogie Nights" and ifyou like a Titanic movie, rent "A Night to Remember", please.
