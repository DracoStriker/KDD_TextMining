As for my comments on Titanic,  It didn't start to get good until theshipwent down.  I don't mean that in a bad way, but it was too slow, and wasjammed with special effects, the story line was horrible, and stupid.  Thewhole love story is so predictable.  Not to mention the story sucked evenmore because you knew the ship was gonna go down and the only thingholdingthe story together were the special effects.  It didn't start getting gooduntil the action kicked in when the ship was going down.  I suggest skipthe first tape and start the movie on the second tape.
