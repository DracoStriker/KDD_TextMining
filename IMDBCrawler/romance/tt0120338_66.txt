This movie, despite the inordinate quantity of rewards it received,combines clichés and stilted dialogue to produce a passable effort.However, the length makes it excessively tedious. The script was badlywritten to the extent that the high points of the movie were themammeries of Kate Winslet and the death of Leonardo's character, whichprovides some elation as the movie is, at that point, bound to roll thecredits and leave you in piece. The special effects were anachievement, but the nauseating level of self-conscious sentimentalismthat underpinned the movie burdened these scenes and leave youwondering why you should be compelled to care. The overall message isthe same "love conquers all" message with a very familiar method.Highly recommended for those who suffer insomnia.
