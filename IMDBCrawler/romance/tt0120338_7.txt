I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron'sfictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurances washaunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer thatthis movie would not have worked without him.Kate Winslet was stunning as Rose and this movie belonged to her as youcouldn't imagine anyone else playing this role.Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack and  he should have had an  anOscar nomination for this role and the ever brilliant Billy Zane didn'tdisappoint in his role as Rose's fiance Cal. His portrayl of Cal was so evilthat despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry forhim, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie heworks on to the ultimate level.Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a fewof the laughs of the film. Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were puremagic.This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Centuryand one that will never be forgotten.
