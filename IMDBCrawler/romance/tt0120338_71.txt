Greetings from Lithuania.I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countlessdocumentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it getsme every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even atthis time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor,all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I cannot understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. Theysay it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw morechezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx "movies"comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hatewhat is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rarecombination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least,and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can alwaysjust ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it gotwhat it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardlynforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.
