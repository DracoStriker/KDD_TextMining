The technical execution of the ship sinking is entertaining. The rest of themovie is worthless dribble.I can understand why an adolescent girl would sigh over some dumb littletwerp proclaiming his love with his dying breath to a woman he has known fortwo days. However, anyone over the age of 15 who doesn't have to suppress agag reflex at the idea has no standards at all. There was no chemistrybetween the leads. The writing was atrocious.Cameron failed miserably to develop anyempathy for any of the major characters. The movie sank long before the shipdid.A bad, bad, bad movie. The worst movie to win Best Picture since ForrestGump. And that took some doing.
