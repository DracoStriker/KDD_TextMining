Titanic is my all-time favorite film. This film breathed life back intothe Hollywood epic. Sadly, many people don't see it as an epic. Theysee it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story.But contrary to popular belief, the film focuses just as much on theship as it does on the love story. It blends fact and fiction so wellin a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are veryeasy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossibleto make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I'veever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also hasone of the important life morals: only life is priceless and makingeach day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue ispredictable and at times stilted. But that doesn't stop it from being amasterpiece. Because there is nothing in the film that I would improve,I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING.
