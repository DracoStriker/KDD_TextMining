Trying to get beyond all the hype-- the ludicrous praise and the vehementreaction against-- I tried to rate this movie objectively, and and indoingso I gave it a three out of ten. It is not the worst movie ever made, andit's certainly not the best. Some nice special effects. Hackneyedtwo-dimensional characters and dialogue written for early teens, but notparticularly offensive. Can be watched from start to finish once with onlyadozen or so moments of cringing.However, what did sink right along with that ship was the prestige of theOscar Award itself. Now the Oscars have given out silly "Best Pictures" inthe past, and there has always been a creeping element of the Grammies'"popularity contest" about them that kept them from ever getting too "highbrow"; but with the choosing of "Titanic" as the Best Picture for 1997, Ihonestly believe that the Academy did serious damage to its reputation formany years to come. Previously, serious film lovers knew that while theOscars certainly weren't a foolproof measure of quality; in retrospect,theyhave produced a list of the greatest films that, on the whole, stands thetest of time just as well as any list created by the Cannes, Venice,Berlinor Toronto film festivals. But this year (1997) changed everything. Notonlydid they overlook one of the best films of the decade ("L.A.Confidential"),but they made an obvious bow to box office as a ratings ploy andlowest-common-denominator crowd pleaser. With time, the decision to crownanovergrown adolescent throwaway flick the best movie of the year will hauntthem mercilessly-- if it doesn't already.
