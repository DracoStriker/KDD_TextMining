every time i think about this movie i get ticked off. it was just so bad.james cameron! you made terminator and aliens, man! what is this schlock?!leonardo dicaprio! you made this boy's life and what's eating gilbertgrape!what is this schlock?! kate winslet! i don't know anything about you butyouseem to be pretty good! what is this schlock?! bill paxton!well...anyways, kind of cool special effects, but the story is pathetic. theromance is absurd and unbelievable. the characters are paper thin and icould have cared less who died by the end. this was the year i lost allrespect for the academy (although it had already been severely damaged byforrest gump beating pulp fiction). how did titanic beat la confidential,goodwill hunting, and as good as it gets??? because of a great marketingandPR job and a fan base of 100 million adolescent girls the academy wasafraidwould attack their families should titanic lose. an epic doesn't needhundreds of millions of dollars thrown a it to be good. just look atlawrence of arabia. one last word about dicaprio in specific: dude, thebeach was not a good return film from titanic and a big break. i only hopegangs of NY makes all the difference (don't take this the wrong way,you'rea great actor in my book but your judgement of choice is poor lately). ifany director can jumpstart someone's career it's scorsese.
