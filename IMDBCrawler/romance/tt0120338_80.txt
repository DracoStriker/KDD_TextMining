Titanic is a fairly good movie, but I personally think the historical partof the movie seemed to be more touching and overall better then the lovestory between Jack and Rose. Their relationship seemed to have all of theaspects that every Hollywood romantic-fantasy has: the two young lovers arebreaking the social code to be seeing each other, they're both young enoughto pass as teenagers..(which, in this film, I think they are) , there is asteamy scene, and it has a touch of tragedy. Well, it's all very predictablebut James Cameron did a wonderful job with the story of the ship Titanic. Ifound that part more touching and realistic than the love story. You reallycan see the passenger's terror and panic during the sinking sequence. Itsall very saddening to watch because, as you watch it, you know that itactually happened many years ago. The amount of detail put into it wasincredible, from the "woman and children first, first class first" to themusicians staying aboard to play, the fireworks... all very nice to watch.
