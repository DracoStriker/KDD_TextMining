Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channelchanger. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the otherperson grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera.Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her andLeo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missingthem; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fateand lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron dida brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to theforeground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leoalive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we canplease continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying whenLeo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leotries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) isswept away by the flooded corridor. So much for cryingpriorities!!I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he'stapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting aselect category of people that were willing to see this over and over(Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewingsworldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white "ANight To Remember" movie instead.Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled withchains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't seethe spraying blood. This is life and death...better leave it toluck!7 out of 10
