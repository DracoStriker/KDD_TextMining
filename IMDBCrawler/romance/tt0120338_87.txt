Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you reallyshould see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetlychange. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-storyand think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only onetothink this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the moviethinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not asimpressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is notbad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win anoscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins orDenzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for lessthan $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly anyfilms with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character ofthe film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. Ialsotink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitudetogether.There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too manylove-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance into every single movie!!!Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.
