After hearing several people talking about this particular movie and howmany times they went back to see it, I bought the movie, watched it onetime, put it away and have never gotten it back out again.  Grantedeverything was on a grand scale, good story-line, and somewhat interestingcharacters.  But I'm afraid the only thing most people (females) went againand again to see was Leonardo DiCaprio.  I enjoyed what special effectsthere were and had quite a long wait to see them and then it was over.Sorry, this wasn't one for me.
