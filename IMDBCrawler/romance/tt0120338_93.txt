I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-ramaever the "grace" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about twolittle spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like"I'll never let go". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived itfelt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters wereeven half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio isa loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supportingactor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat wouldjust sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet wasthreatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling"Jump! Do it, Jump!"  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocentpeople in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since thecharacters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of thewhole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat fromsinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is ifyou got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a rootcanal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for thepain.
