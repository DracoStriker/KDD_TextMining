The movie portrays First Officer William Murdoch in a way that is totallycontrary to the truth but instead suits a particular propagandist position.This is both immoral and grossly hurtful to Murdoch's descendants. No wonderthe Chinese government recommended the movie to their people. It amazes mehow modern American filmakers seem to delight in tearing down the societyand values they have grown up in. The film is an insult to all thosepassengers and crew who showed such tremendous courage in the face of ahorrific death. In reality it was NOT two 90's style teenagers who were theheroes of the Titanic.
