One of The Best Movies At All The Times there are great scents at thismovie and really this is more than a movie.it has an excellent score and song.they are so deep.also titanic has won 11 Oscars in 1998 Leo and Kate played very good atthis movie.also Kate Winslet is very beautiful actress.the start and end of this film was very good.the scent of jack's death was so deep.in my idea 14 Oscars nominations and 11 wining was worthy for titanic.absolutely it was the best movie of James Cameroons.
