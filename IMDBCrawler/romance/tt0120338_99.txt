Titanic:Number one box office takings of all time, by a mile. Special effectsbetterthan any other movie, ever.And nowhere to be seen on the IMDB voters' top 250.Why the disparity? Because Special Effects do not a Movie Make, and cannotcover the cracks in the pedestrian plot and the cardboardcharacterisation.The ultimate reputation of this film has been sunk not by an iceberg but asimilarly immovable object; the judgment of movie-lovers.
