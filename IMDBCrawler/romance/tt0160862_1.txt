When I saw this film a couple of years ago, I was sixteen, I sort ofloved it. Seeing it again, not in my teenage years anymore, I realizethat 'She's All That' really is for teenagers. I still like it, yes,but now that I have seen so many more movies there are a lot ofpredictable, therefore lesser, parts.For starters it is set on a high school but the characters seem to bein their mid-twenties. Of course that is pretty logical since theactors are in their mid-twenties. Well, Rachael Leigh Cook was onlytwenty, and I have to admit that she is the main reason to see thismovie if you are a guy. Freddie Prinze Jr. is her love interest andpersonally I think he is one of the most annoying actors out there, noexception here.The whole story is very predictable actually. Prinze is the mostpopular guy on their high school, just dumped by his beautifulgirlfriend. Now he makes a bet with a friend: he can turn any girl intoa prom queen. The friend selects the girl and of course he choosesRachael Leigh Cook. Convenient for Prinze, since she already is abeautiful girl. It does not really matter whether she wears glasses andfloppy pants. Of course he really falls in love with her, of course thebet comes out, of course the girl is mad, of course the movie end onthe prom, and of course it will be a happy ending.Yes, predictable it is, but also sweet, even with an actor like Prinze.Sometimes it is funny and when you are watching a romantic comedy allyou really want, I guess, is the main characters get together in a niceway. That sort of happens. A teenager will probably love it, but otherswill not completely waste their time.
