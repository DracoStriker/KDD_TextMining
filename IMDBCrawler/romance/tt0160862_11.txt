Silly but fun teen romantic comedy about a high school jock (FreddiePrinze, Jr.) who bets his friend (Paul Walker) that he can turn a geek(Rachael Leigh Cook) into the prom queen. Flimsy updating of Pygmalionis hard to hate. It doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Yeahit's absolutely ridiculous that Rachael Leigh Cook, an exceptionallypretty girl, would be considered unattractive just because she wearsglasses and overalls. But you just roll with it because it's cute andfun. The cast is very likable and the script is good for this type ofmovie. Matthew Lillard steals pretty much every scene he's in. It'sfluff but you'll be smiling when it's over. Can't see the harm in that.
