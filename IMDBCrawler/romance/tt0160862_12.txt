That the IMDb score is way too low speaks I think to the fact that theintended audience for the film was ... disappointed. Perhapsexpectations were too high? Perhaps this story had been done once toooften. But the odd fact (and the thrust of this review) is that thefilm is memorable because the stars rise above the material .... beforethey themselves burn out and lapse into film obscurity.It was an odd confluence of talent. Director Iscove is well respectedin TV but this remains one of his only shots at a feature. Prinze, whohad pretty much owned the casting niche he was in, was 23 at the timethe film was made and arguably long in the tooth for a high schooler.Nonetheless the chemistry between him and Leigh-Cook was powerful andthat chemistry held the movie up when the dialog and the mugging by theother actors let it down.It's all timing. Leigh-Cook never really made the transition to filmsafter, but kept very busy with TV. Prinze never really made thetransition, period, but he's still a young guy and who knows? ThePygmalion thing has been done to death but oddly Iscove, Prinze andLeigh-Cook kept it alive for one more outing. Entertaining.
