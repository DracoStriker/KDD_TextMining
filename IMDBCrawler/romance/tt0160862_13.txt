Seeing this now as a 20 year old and it coming out when I was only justaround 4 years old, it makes me think how the 1990's were awesome.Although I have to say, this movie unlike today gives us a scoop of theway people are stereotypically just judged people by the way they lookand change them. I honestly think Zac shouldn't have really changedLaney but really let Laney change for herself like!I was so happy to see the stars in this film. Usher really made hischaracter bring a good vibe as a school DJ. Paul Walker (RIP) wasbrilliant at acting as a really mad frat guy, although I didn't thinkhe was gonna take Laney at the end of the day haha! Also seeing Lil Kimreally enlightened this film, however she didn't get much lines in thisfilm which was a bit disappointing but it was great to see her in thefilm. :)
