Usually I like movies of all kinds, and try to judge them accordingly -- ifa film is meant to leave you laughing, I place it against other mindlesscomedies.  But even as compared to other teen romances, "She's All That"left me with a headache and a feeling that I'd completely wasted ninedollars.  The plot is completely unoriginal, the jokes only mediocre andpredictable, the characters two-dimensional at most, and the badly-portrayedstereotypes incredibly mind-numbing.  This was the first time any movie hasinduced a twenty-minute nap -- and also the first time I didn't miss a thingwhile I was sleeping.
