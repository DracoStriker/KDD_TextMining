I'd actually recommend seeing it if you don't feel like a heavy movieand just want to watch something fun. The movie is 'another teen movie"but does have some unique aspects to it, some pretty funny quotes("what is this, the dork outreach program?")and moments, butunfortunately, a lot of that average teen movie drama and a few overlytwo-dimensional characters (Zach's friends and girlfriend). Cool dancescene though, and Freddie Prinze Jr. is bearable Rachel Leigh Cook islikable (I personally thought she was pretty good in it) and notablytalented actors like Kevin Pollak, Kieran Culkin, and Anna Paquin givethe movie some supporting foundation. Not a bad movie, not a greatmovie, just simply what it is:'another teen movie'.
