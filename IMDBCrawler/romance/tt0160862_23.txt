shes all that, or she's all twaat, take your pick. Why is America soshallow, put real ugly people in films what are they afraid off, herein the real world people like WATS name would be classed as veryattractive, oh lets put some glasses on a stunning girl and call herugly--then take the glasses off and oh look she's beautiful, the samecan be said of ugly Betty, and the princess diary's, thats why i hatethese silly films and the shallow message it sends out to the world,ugly ducklings should be ignored and pretty girls adored, OK i onlywatched about 25 Min's of this film because it became unbearable, if iturned my nose up at everyone who wore glasses and dowdy clothes i'ddbe a very lonely young man, however i am not that fussy.Ugly betty---princess diary's-- shes all twaat, should be put in theugly bin, put some REAL people in movies, fat people with spots andwort's make better actors anyway.
