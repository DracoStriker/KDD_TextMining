I'm not a fan of romantic comedies.I don't really like the premise of disposing of one's individuality to winpopular acceptance.So why do i like this movie??Is it Matthew Lillard, excellent as Brock Hudson?Is it the lovely sunshine and locations?Is it the idealised look at High School Life?Is it just the general atmosphere of well-being i get from watchingit?Hell yeah! It's silly, unrealistic, vacuous, but damnit, i enjoyed watchingit!One note, though, you might want to watch something a bit moreintellectually stimulating afterwards.
