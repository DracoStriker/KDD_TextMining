The tread that runs true in all treatment of Shaw's work is that in theeffort to reshape an "object" the shaper is altered. Sure, we wouldlike it if Mr. Stud could understand the value of the ugly ducklingright from the beginning, but his transformation is as beautiful towatch as hers is fun.There are some particular aspects of this film that make thisre-working of the story interesting. The death of the mother and theexpressions through art make for increased depth in the feminine sideof this story (something you don't get in My Fair Lady, for example).Our family also enjoyed the use of the theme from "I'm getting closerto my home" in the score.
