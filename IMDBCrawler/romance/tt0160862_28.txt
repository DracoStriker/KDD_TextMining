So predictable, so derivative.  This film came recommended but I feel thatthe recommendation was misplaced.  Taming of the Shrew has been remade manytimes but in some cases (Pygmalion, My Fair Lady) new eras and genres addsomething.  In this case, we have "taming meets teen-movie" - nothing isadded, only taken away.Cook is very watchable, but she's no shrew which somewhat side-steps thepoint.  And as for having a chip on your shoulder about the jet-setters whenyou're a teenager living in a house with a huge basement that you canmonopolise as your art studio and a swimming pool in the garden.  Please. At least in Pretty in Pink the poverty was more relative and somewhatabsolute (although even then, if you can afford a car and have ajob........). Unless you have never seen a teen movie and/or never seen a remake ofTaming, you've already got this tee-shirt many times over so this movie isnot worth the 90 minute wait for the closing credits.  My partner, Janie,was asleep within four minutes and barely stirred until the end, which is arecord even for her.
