I had heard someone say that this film was supposed to be a modern "MyFair Lady". That had me put my expectations a little too high. Laney isthe cliché "unpretty, pretty girl" who becomes the object of a bet inwhich Dean, play boy jerk, bets senior president, super popular, allthat guy Zack that he can't make her prom queen. Like any otherpredictable teen 90s movie, Zack starts to fall for the out of theordinary, quirky Laney as he gets to know her. With her help he is alsoable to deal with his life problems and everything is happily everafter. Many of the films targeted towards teens during this time,during anytime really, all have really similar plots. It's not likethis film is a break-through or has a message so incredibly deep thatthe world would be lost without its insight, but as far as these moviesgo it isn't the worst ever. It would be good to watch with a group offriends if you're trying to be sentimental, but don't expect to feelmoved by the end.
