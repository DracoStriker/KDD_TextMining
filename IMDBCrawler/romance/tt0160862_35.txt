For all the people complaining that Rachel Leigh Cook is pretty anyway,that's the whole point. Zach does not change Laney; she was alwayspretty but just didn't give herself the chance. This isn't a film aboutturning an ugly girl into a pretty girl; rather a film about puttingyourself out there and allowing yourself to be pretty. To pick anunattractive actress to transform would send out the message that theonly way you will ever be accepted is if you tart yourself up.The premise is quite thin and perhaps a more severe transformationwould have been more entertaining but Freddie Prince Junior, as Zach,the jock who makes a bet that he can't transform the geekiest girl inthe school Laney (Rachel Leigh Cook) into prom queen is charismatic andhas nice chemistry with Cook. There are also some entertaining minorcharacters, such as Zach's sister (played by Anna Paquin) and Laney'sbrother.There is one gross-out scene that feels a little out of place in whatis quite a gentle story about coming out from your shell; I wouldn'treally describe this as a rom-com. Still, it's a good film to watch ona Friday night with a couple of friends, and it has some good morals.
