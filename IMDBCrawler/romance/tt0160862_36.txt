King of high school Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is unceremoniouslydumped by hot queen Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) for an idiotrealty TV star (Matthew Lillard). While bragging about his prowess,he's challenged by his douche friend Dean Sampson (Paul Walker) toremake class freak Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a prom queen.It's sort of like a modern adaptation of Pygmalion. This and other teenmovies are prime to be mocked. RLC is a hot girl, and of course we onlyrealize it after she takes her glasses off. But every genre has it'sown clichés and it's own stereotypes. It doesn't negate the genre. Thisis a prime example of a movie taking all the clichés and making it allwork for them.The most important part is definitely RLC. She does the grumpy girl andthe sweet girl. And she does both by being the cutest ever. There arealso some great young actors of that era including Anna Paquin, DuléHill, and Gabrielle Union. The cast is a young energetic group.
