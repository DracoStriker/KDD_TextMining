She's All ThatThe only downside to being Prom Queen is that you can't behead any ofyour zit-faced subjects.Fortuitously, the Prom Queen in this teen-comedy is merely a pawn.Distraught over a break-up, Zach (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) makes a bet withhis friend Dean (Paul Walker) that he can turn any female candidateinto a royal consort before the prom.In charge of selecting a worthy contender, Dean decides on Laney(Rachael Leigh Cook), a dowdy art student.Accepting the challenge, Zach begins reworking the reject andeventually turns her into something very regal.But Zach's newfound feelings for Laney are jeopardized when she learnsthe truth.With doe eyed leads and a dumbed down plot, this slightly amusingadaptation of Pygmalion turns the ugly duckling anecdote on its ear.Besides, it doesn't matter who the Prom Queen is, the Prom King willinevitability be going home with the Prom Lady-in-Waiting.
