Loved this movie. Great for a date, good for a laugh, entertaining anda sweet romantic comedy.Yes, is a pretty predictable plot, but what teen movie isn't? It hadsome unique aspects that I thought were creative and entertaining.I thought it was well cast and well acted. The parts where I wassupposed to laugh, I found myself laughing. The parts where I wassupposed to get angry, I got angry. And the parts were I was supposedto yearn for love, I yearned. Whoever rates this poorly, probably doesn't understand the PURPOSE andMEANING of a romantic comedy teen movie... This one totally fits thebill.
