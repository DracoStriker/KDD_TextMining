"She's All That" is a derivative teen flick from director Robert Iscovethat uses well-worn formulas and an ugly duckling nerd to win youngaudiences.From writer R. Lee Fleming Jnr., some segments of the pic are veryfunny, and the cast, including Freddie Prinze Jnr., Rachael Leigh Cook,Kevin Pollak, Matthew Lillard, Paul Walker, Anna Paquin and KieranCulkin, are very likable.However these two points are the only positives that keep the movieabove average.Saturday, April 3, 1999 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase
