In the pantheon of high school movies, She's All That probably isn't inthe top ten, but it certainly isn't anywhere near the bottom either.Freddie Prinze plays the #1 high school jock, who isn't so sure hewants to follow in his father's footprints. His father is played by TimMatheson in a bit of an inside joke for film buffs. Rachael Leigh Cookplays a young artistic type who begins to see the possibilities forherself. After Prinze is dumped by his high school hottie girlfriendfor an MTV Real World idiot Matthew Lillard, he bets he can make a promqueen out of Rachael to replace her. Yes, the usual complicationsensue, and there are several believability issues. Cook finds out aboutthe bet and ditches Prinze, but the film is made watchable by theplethora of young, familiar faces sprinkled throughout the film.Lillard is especially obnoxious and funny as a narcissistic dolt. SarahMichelle Gellar appears for a few seconds in a school lunch scene. Thefilm also contains "Kiss Me", the infectious Sixpence None The Richersong. **1/2 of 4 stars.
