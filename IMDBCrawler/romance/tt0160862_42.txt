A Romantic Comedy, which means it is a drama and not at all romantic. Agood guy jock tries to make a prom queen from a sensitive geeky girl towin a bet. Problems are caused by his earlier girlfriend, who isbrain-between-legs-type, heartless and trashy, and who has alreadyfound a new guy, a sleazy reality show celebrity. Well-meaning and acommercial hit made in the same year than flop excrement like 8mm orFight Club, so who says the audience is always wrong? But there'snothing too impressive or entertaining either, just teen drama clichés.Well, at least some bullies get to taste their own medicine (a rathergross pizza in this case).
