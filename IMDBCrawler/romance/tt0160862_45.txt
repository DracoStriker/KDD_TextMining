I watched this movie very late..from it's premiere ..7 years late..andi get the feeling that it was better this way..now that i know and haveseen most of it's actors..many of them who happen to be now very goodand payed Hollywood stars..like Paul Walker or Gabrielle Union...so..imust say that for me this film was great..to see all these familiarfaces together in one movie since they were kids made me like thismovie a lot.i know most of the people don't like teen movies anymorebut they still have their educational purposes and can be welcomed eachyear (at least for USA) with a new version and new actors..who mightcome for the future big screen as stars! I say it's well done and ihope nothing of this idea change over future.Long live the teens !
