not a mind blowing summary, but yeah. I thought this film was good. Itwas like a nice transformation for the characters finding there way Ithought, so yeah I liked it. And I saw it with my friends on a Saturdaynight, so thats what this film reminds me of, so yeah, its a good filmto watch with your mates. I didn't see it when it first came out in thecinemas, my friend had it in the back, so we ended up all watching it,and like, got me near a crying point (im just that sort of person). Soif you like a good hearted film with a lot of gags and all that, thenyou should watch it. Its got something for everyone. There are also alot of good tunes along the way and all that. Plus, it'll have youtalking about it! So you should all give this film a fairly good kudos!because it deserves it!! So if you haven't seen it, then get off thiscomment and rent it! And watch it with your friends, there's a partthat you might not want to see it with your parentals or your grandparents, as like there's a sex bet if I remember right? I think soanyway, so your best off to go watch it with your mates!
