SHE'S ALL THAT **1/2 Typical teen comedy that has smirk-faced FreddiePrinze Junior and near-recluse Rachael Leigh Cook draw together in ahigh school setting. We discover almost right away that Prinze Junioris portraying a rather shallow, self-absorbed school mascot while amore tolerable humanity comes from Cook's character. He makes a betthat he can make any girl the school's Prom Queen in a matter of weeks,she becomes his target, and they fall in opposite-attract love becausethe screenplay says they should. The film is not very involving becausethe characters are somewhat colourless, and the turn-out seems toounlikely. (Or do I mean too likely?)
