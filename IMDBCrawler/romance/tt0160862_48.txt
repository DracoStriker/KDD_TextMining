This is one of those classic, unbelievable, clichéd, unfunny teenflicks released in the late 90's. I can't be sure whether this wasripped off the (slightly) superior 'Ten things I hate about you' or theother way around, but they both revolve on the same idea: Rich, popularboy (10 things had a violent loner; how original!) makes a bet withanother rich, popular boy to go out with the school nerd (or the femaleviolent loner). Rich popular boy, after getting the nerd a HUGEmakeover, (she actually just took off her glasses and changed clothes,but in a movie like this, that's a MAJOR plot development) falls forthe nerd. She finds out, but he makes some sort of gesture to show he'schanged and they have a magical kiss. Some of the cast, (Kieran Culkin,Anna Paquin, even Rachael Leigh Cook, to a certain extent), are quitetalented, which makes you wonder what they're doing there. The rest,(Freddie Prinze Jr., Paul Walker, Jodie Lynn O'Keefe), are perfect forthis kind of movie.If you must see either this or 10 things, I say go with 10 things. Thatactually has one or 2 laughs in it.
