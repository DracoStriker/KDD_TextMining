There are some movies that make me just stop what I'm doing and watch.Braveheart, Clear and Present Danger, Casino Royale, Godfather I andII, Goodfellas, Top Gun are just a few that come to mind. Not all areclassics, but all have _something_ to them that engrosses me. She's AllThat is one of those movies.Yes, Rachel Leigh Cook is so so cute. Fuggedaboudat. Watch her. See ifshe delivers one line as if she memorized it, as if she's repeatingwhat someone else wrote. There's not one unnatural act or utterancefrom her. She is completely believable, and because her character ringsso true, you cannot help but empathize with her, and that is what makesthe movie -- when she wins out in the end, you're happy she did becauseshe makes you care about her. She's as good as Kate Blanchett was inThe Aviator (completely different movies, completely different roles,by Blanchett deservedly won an Oscar). She has that characterabsolutely nailed, you won't see - can't see -- a better performance.(And for what it is worth, this may be Paul Walker's best performance.I credit the director for getting the performances that he did out ofcast of young actors not generally known for their talent.) As for therest of the movie, you've seen it before, but so what? Star Wars isBattle of Britain, set in the future with a backstory, no one holdsthat against it. The choreographed dance scene is great, and it IS wellcast and it IS well acted, clichéd or not.
