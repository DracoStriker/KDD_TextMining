Superior high school love match starring Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachel LeighCook. A formulaic plot is the jumping off point for a teen movie sprinkledwith wit, charm and some cunningly self-referential gagsNeither director Iscove nor his good-looking cast can pretend there'sanything remarkable about the bare bones of this ugly-duckling comedy. In astraightforward rehash of 'My Fair Lady', high school jock Zach (Prinze Jr)bets he can transform uber-geek Laney (Leigh Cook) into an ultra-babe by thetime the school prom comes round. Earnest, arty and committed to her family,Laney is never given a second glance by anyone. Until, of course, Zachpersuades her to remove her glasses. Former 'Friends' writer Fleming supplies a sharp script ("There are childrenin Mexico who've been up for three hours making shirts for corporateAmerica") and the film's littered with in-jokes and sly references to filmand TV, the best of which sees Zach's ex (O'Keefe) dumping him for one ofthe participants of MTV's 'The Real World' (Lillard). Naturally Zach falls in love with Laney and Laney hates Zach when shediscovers she is really a trophy girlfriend. But with leads this likeableand a knees-up showdown courtesy of Fatboy Slim, Iscove's teen comedy is,mostly, all that. VerdictZippy little charmer driven by likeable leads that's a grade or two aboverecent gross-out teenage fare.
