In memory of the classic story as seen in "My fair lady" comes She's allthat. this movie is in all ways a lame, unintelligent Teen chick flick. Thismovie is what you'll get when you take the play Pygmalion, Rape it, minusthe intelligence and magic of either the play or the movie, put bad actorsin the main parts, and make it really stupid and soppy. No SIR this movie isbad and if you want to see something bad with at least a laugh rather see"Not another teen movie" because thats what I said when I discovered whatthis movie was.
