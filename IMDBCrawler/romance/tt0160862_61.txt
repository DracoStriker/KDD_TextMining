This film has a very similar feel to it as "10 things I hate about you".It's not as good a film, in my opinion, but it does have a certain charm andworks your emotions a bit.I have to agree with the critics that Rachael Leigh Cook is far too prettyat the beginning of the film, so the whole premise that it would beimpossible to "tidy her up" is a bit thin. This plot element is still beingused - see "The Princess Diaries" for the best version (IMHO) - and wasprobably originally taken from the Cinderella story.Of course, a deeper meaning of the film is about making choices and comingof age, but this is not very clearly shown as it gets in the way of the maintheme of the film - being proud of who you are.
