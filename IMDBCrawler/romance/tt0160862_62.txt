Unabashed remake of Pretty in Pink - or countless other movies for thatmatter. Plot follows a well-trodden path: upper-class boy snob breaks upwith upper-class girl snob and somehow finds/gets involved withlower-classgirl who has the character his old girlfriend didn't have. Lots ofsub-plots, over-the-top final prom dance scene (again, just like PiP).KevinPollack takes the Harry Dean Stanton role. Good work as well by Jodi LynO'Keefe as the grossly exaggerated Taylor Vaughn. Enjoyable, but not assatisfying as PiP by a long shot, with an ending that doesn't quite'click'.
