boring, the worst piece of crap ever.  I watched this on pay per view, andIam so sick that I spent 3.99 on this movie.  rachel leigh cook was never ageeky looking girl, so you know that she was gonna turn out to be a babe.oh, there was a funny part, the one with freddy prinze and the hacky sack.that part was funny.  but the movie overall was an embarrassment.  don'teven think about watching this.  it is such a waste.
