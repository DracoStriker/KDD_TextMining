Loved Rachel Leigh Cook.  Other than that, I have nothing good to say aboutthe movie.  You know where the story is going, and what is going to happen,right from the start.Furthermore -- and I wish someone in Hollywood would listen to this -- highschool is not anything like what's depicted in this movie.I'm sure there are many great stories that could be told about adolescence,the search for popularity, the need for acceptance, the difficulties of teenrelationships, etc.  This movie is nowhere close to exploring any of thoseissues.  It isn't funny, either.I gave it a 4.  Not a complete waste, but very far from asuccess.
