Of all the movies Freddy Prinze Jr. has starred in, this is probably thebest. And I can't believe I just wrote that. Seriously though, just lookathis filmography: I Know What You Did Last Summer, I Still Know What YouDidLast Summer, Summer Catch, Wing Commander (ha!), and, most recently,ScoobyDoo. Not exactly a list that would catch the Academy's eye, right? Still,like I said, She's All That is the most watchable. I couldn't stand thewhole, "Dude, I bet you can't turn that geeky chick into the prom queen"plot, since its probably the oldest and crustiest of the teen movie genre.If you can't predict the rest of the movie with just the above quote toguide you, here's some questions to ponder in that noggin' ofyours:1. Will the geek resent the jock's advances?2. Will the two share a touching moment?3. Will the two find common interests?4. Will the jock actually come to CARE for the geek?5. Will the geek find out about the bet?6. Will she get UPSET upon learning about the bet???7. Will the two, against all odds, get together in theend????????There are a few quirky moments that should be watched just for the sake ofgetting through this film. The artsy cafe featuring midgets in purplespandex, for one, and the ten minute dance sequence at the Big Dance (withUsher, yes, Usher as the DJ). 2 out of 4 stars.
