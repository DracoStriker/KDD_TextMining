With everone holding their breath to see how 'Scooby Doo' turns out, here'sa chance to see three of that movie's stars united in a lightweight butenjoyable teen-com. Yes, the whole 'ugly duckling' plotline is a tadfamiliar, but it's still great fun. Freddie Prinze Jr is likeable as themale lead (check out his his hysterical 'hackey-sack' set piece) and MattLillard is given carte blanche to let rip with his well-tested "irritatingtwerp" persona in a supporting role. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, she mayonly pop up in a blink-and-you'll miss-her cameo, but there's no mistakingher magic as she puts the icing on the cake of a very sweet confection.Perhaps if she'd walked in front of the cameras when Prinze Jr and Lillardwere filming the leaden 'Wing Commander', that movie would have been thenext 'Star Wars'! All in all, a fun flick and a great datemovie.
