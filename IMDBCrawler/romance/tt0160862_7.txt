I just saw this movie for the sixth or seventh time on television and Iwondered what Rachael Leigh Cook was doing these days. So I checked theIMDb and to my amazement I saw that this movie is rated with amiserable 5.4! What the hell? In my opinion She's all that is one ofthe best movies in it's teenager/highschool/romcom genre. The story iscomfortable predictable and all the performances (from Freddy Prinze toRachel Leigh Cook and even Matthew Lillard - who's pretty hilarious)are great. We also find Paul Walker (pretty scary!) and Anna Paquin inone of their earlier roles.Director Robert Iscove also has some nice visual surprises in store forus. The way he introduces the Florida flashback at the pool may be lentfrom Tucker: A man and his dream, but it works very well. One of thebest parts is the dance scene to the music of Fat Boy Slim at the endof the movie. The choreography is excellent and the camera-work firstrate. I think that scene is an absolute classic (especially since itwasn't even planned to be in the movie).All in all She's all that is pretty underrated, I think. It's difficultto make a good romantic movie, I know. I love the genre, but the onlyones that really survive the test of time can be counted on one hand.Rob Reiner's The Sure Thing and When Harry Met Sally are up there.Garry Marshall's Frankie and Johnny, Ang Lee's Sense & Sensibility, TheNotebook and Simon West's Pride & Prejudice also come to mind.She's all that may not be a classic like the movies I mentioned before,but there's more to that movie than you would think after first seeingit.A miserable 5.4... Come on, guys! 8,5 out of 10
