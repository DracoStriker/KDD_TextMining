**POSSIBLE SPOILER**Mediocre Rom Com starring Freddie Prinze Jr as Zach Siler, class presidentand top of the social ladder at a LA high school. His position at the top ofthe schools hierarchy is put in jeopardy when his prom queen materialgirlfriend Taylor Vaughn dumps him for Brock Hudson, the "dyslexicvolleyball player" from tv show "the real world." The movie centres on a betin which Zach wagers that he can turn any girl into prom queen. Enter LaneyBoggs, glasses wearing, art loving social outcast, and quickly Zachsunbelievably difficult challenge to buy her a fashionable dress and take offher pair of geeky glasses before prom begins. In my opinion this mediocre romantic comedy is more than saved by theappearance of Matthew Lilard as Brock Hudson. If you love the Stiflers(American Pie) of this world then the 10mins of Matthew Lilard as thenarcissistic wannabe actor with a tattoo of himself on his arm may be wortha look. If people of this ilk don't amuse you, perhaps you might do well togive this movie a miss.
