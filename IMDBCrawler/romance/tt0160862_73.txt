I'm not the world's biggest fan of teenage American romances. It may bebecause I'm also not the world's biggest fan of American teenagers. But Ireally enjoyed this one.The story is fairly familiar; a handsome jock takes a bet that he cantransform any girl in the school into the prom queen. His friends choose theserious and arty Rachel Leigh Cook. Romance blossoms and she finds herselfvying for prom queen against the jock's snooty ex-girlfriend.So all the cliches are there; the jock, the outcast, the in crowd, the prom,the bet. What lifts this one from the ordinary are attractive and appealingleads, a nice cameo from Kevin Pollack as the father who just can't win onJeopardy, and, of course, a really nice theme song.A perfect popcorn movie.
