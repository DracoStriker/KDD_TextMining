Reading other reviewers comments suddenly made me realize why this film mademe so angry. Yes, it was the fact that Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook) wastreated like dirt by everyone. To be honest I didn't think Zack (FreddiePrinze Jr) deserved to get the girl. If he one iota of decency he wouldforegone the role of Prom King and kept Laney well away from his phonyfriends before it even reached Prom Night. But he selfishly didn't andshowed he just wanted his moment of peer adulation from his spoiltfriends.Why should comedy be had from picking on a girl who's mother had died whenshe was a child and didn't want to be part of the 'in' crowd. But obviouslythe writers believe that should be Laney's sole goal at school, was to bepopular.It must have been only Rachel Leigh Cook's acting performance that kept mewatching until the end of the film. To be honest she reminds a lot of ayoung Mary Stuart Masterson who played rather too many of these charactersuntil she became type cast. I only hope Rachel Leigh Cook gets the chance asomething more meatier in the future.
