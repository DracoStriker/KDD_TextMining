  This movie has a good moral lesson. Laney Boggs, was however treated likedirt. Taylor Vaughn, a high class snob, who gets it for promqueen,feels her importance. I don't like her. It makes you wonder about hermorals. Laney wasn't much for getting into the lime light. The boysweremean and sadistic, for making a bet, that she would be prom queen. If I hadmy choice, I would rather have Laney than Taylor. Laney was more quiet andcared much, for her studies in art. However she came out a winner. Sheencouraged Zack, to get own with his life.
