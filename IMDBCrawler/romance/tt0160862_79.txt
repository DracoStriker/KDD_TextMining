Before I get to the review, I just wanted to mention an odd thing my VCRdid.  I just saw this movie today for the first time on the USA Network.  MyVCR is one of those that records the start and stop of the commercials.  Thefeature is called "Commercial Advance" - Well, luck (for me anyway) wouldhave it, it fast-forwarded through the entire movie as I was making popcorn. Watching this movie was about as painful as going to the dentist.  First ofall.. Where did they get these lame names from, Zach (Saved by the Bell?),Dean (License to Drive?) and Preston (What is a "Preston"?) - The acting inthis movie was about as bad as the miscasts.  I gagged at the 3 wordedanswers that "Zach" was throwing at his parents during the"parents-are-usually-this-interrogative", gee whiz.  *sigh* After watchingthe next scene, I really wondered when the movie was actually filmed; allthe letters of acceptance lacked Zip codes.  Moving along....  The party:  Bathroom scene: See "Nowhere" which was thedirection the movie was going at that point.  Oh oh oh and the Prom.  I wasgetting flashbacks.  The "Saturday Night Fever" & "Dirty Dancing" mix wassickning.  By the way, from where did they get "Tallulah Bankhead" from? Laney's art teacher appearing out of nowhere and telling her about her workat the Prom?  Hey, I guess those writers needed to put her somewhere. Hello??????? Where is the plot?  Paul Walker steals Laney in the middle ofthe film?  What the?!?! Just loved the graduation scene.  ........ Miramax, no wonder they are theworst.  I made a promise to myself.  Never again will I watch anythingMiramax puts out.  This movie clenched it for me.  Out of 10, this one gets0. F.P. J.R & P.W. are mighty fine <- That kept my interest throughoutthe movie!P.S. Props to my VCR manufacturer for fast-forwarding this movie to theend!
