I loved the movie it had a good plot and great acting. This movie wasso good it won like 8 awards. It is your average teen movie. ZachSiler(Freddie Prinze Jr.) makes a bet that he can turn and unpopulargirl Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into prom queen after beingdumped by his girlfriend Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). The moviehas some aspects of a Rom com with the odd witty comments. FreddiePrinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cook play the characters amazingly theygive you a great impression of the character and how they react incertain situations. If you have seen Not Another Teen Movie then youwill find the plot line similar thats because they stole It from She'sall that. This is a amazing typical romantic teen movie that will makeyour heart melt and i strongly recommend it for girlie nights in.
