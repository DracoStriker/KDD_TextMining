This is the movie were I discovered Rachael Leigh Cook. The movie would havebeen just a teen knock off of "Pygmalian"if it weren't for Rachael's skillin drama(look for the scene were "Laney" gets humiliated). Even thoughRachael steals the whole movie, Paul Walker is good as a slimeball,Gabrielle Union is good as a supporter of Laney and Dule` Hill also isgood.
