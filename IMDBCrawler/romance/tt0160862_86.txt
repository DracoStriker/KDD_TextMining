WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A "PLOT" SPOILER! BE WARNED!I can say the only thing that kept me watching this film was it had manyreferences to my favorite band, Hanson. Otherwise, I found it boring,unrealistic, and basically a snooze. I am a teenager, so I know what it islike to go to school, and this school that "Zach" and "Laney" go to seemslike an unrealistic school. Ok, so they mention the "clicks" of your normalhigh school setting, thats about how realistic it got. When was the lasttime your friend went away on Spring Vacation and came home with a tattooand a MTV star as a boyfriend? The plot seems to be over used too thesedays-- Boy against his will falls in love with girl, later on the girlsfeelings get hurt, they live happily ever after, as if you didn't see thatcoming? You don't need to sit through an hour or so movie about it.Also the actors in this movie are a bunch of pretty faces that can not act.Rachel Leigh Cook just tries (and fails in my view) to act like an adorablegeek but unfortunately due to the acting skills she does not have fails ataseemingly easy job. Which reminds the public that good looks can't get youeverywhere. Freddie Prinze JR, although more than a cute face can act insome movies-- see Wing Commander-- I saw this role as a "mid-life crisis"ora cry for help.I would try by all means to avoid seeing this movie, unless of course youneed to sleep.
