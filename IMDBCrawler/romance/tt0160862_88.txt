Despite some good performances from the two leads, without them this wouldbe a pretty poor film.The story is poor and predictable with an unnatural sounding script a lot ofthe time, typical of these US teen movies, although it does have a fewinstances of credibility.The main problem, however, is that it just isn't very funny most of thetime, a problem for a 'comedy'!!!The Grease inspired dancing at the 'prom' seems out of place, and thecharacters are just too one-dimensional.  I really dislike the constantbombarding of teen films portraying High School life in such a stereotypicalway, and with the constant obsession of the importance of getting beingthese 'perfect' students.....planning for the perfect future, total emphasison a love life (have you ever noticed how in nearly all these films the kidsget into the few top Universities, and how despite being only 18 at mostthey have Dawson Creek style meaningful 'relationships'.School just isn't as clean cut in segregating student types (geeks, jockse.t.c), and the problems and aims of teenage life are much more complex anddiverse than all these films show.  American Pie managed to overcome thesesimilar types of flaws because it had that single advantage of being a muchmore constantly funny film.........with the internet scene!!!!!!!!!!!!!
