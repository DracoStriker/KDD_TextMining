It case you cannot tell, I'm being sarcastic.  The plot of SHE'S ALL THAT isformulaic to say the least, but that's not its real problem.  It's realproblem is the fact that it believes Freddy Prinze Jr. can be that cool andthat smart.  Most popular guy in school AND fourth higher GPA in his class?Suspense of disbelief doesn't work this time.  When he makes those guys eatthat pizza with the *you know what* on it, I couldn't help but wonder...Howcan you possibly do that just because he told you to?  He's not that cool. Oh but he is...Or so the film tries to make us believe.
