This is another teen romantic-comedy (one of the many that came out in1999), but this one is actually really good. It stars a list of who's-who inteen Hollywood stardom, with big names such as Freddie Prinze Jnr ('I StillKnow What You Did Last Summer', 'Boys And Girls'), Rachael Leigh Cook ('TheBabysitters Club Movie', 'Carpool', 'Tom And Huck').The story is about Zach (Prinze), school hunk, who is dumped by populargirlfriend, Taylor, played by Jodi Lynn O-Keefe ('Whatever It Takes'),because she starts dating a party dude Brock ('Scream's' Matthew Lillard), aguy who was featured in The Real World: Miami. Left heart-broken, his bestfriend Dean (Paul Walker of 'The Skulls' fame) bets him that he can't getany girl at school to become Prom Queen in a mere 6 weeks.Enter Laney Boggs (Cook), a complete loser, who is chosen as Zach's'project' to be transformed from her geeky self to the gorgeous young womanshe becomes. With the help of his sister, Mackenzie (Anna Paquin, from'X-Men' and 'The Piano') Laney becomes one of the popular girls inschool.However, just when things are going according to plan, Zach's back-stabbingfriend tells Laney about the bet, in hopes that she'll drop Zach and go toprom with him. And when she confronts him, she admits to it. This sends thenormally-quiet girl into a screaming fit (even yelling out the f-word).Zach's screwed...or is he?Also stars r 'n' b superstars Usher ('The Faculty', 'Set It Off') andKimberly "Li'l Kim" Jones as well as Kevin Pollack and Macaulay's bro, KevinCulkin. Also features the hit single 'Kiss Me' from Sixpence None TheRicher, this is a neat little movie, and does justice to the term 'TeenComedy'. 6/10
