It´s six weeks before prom night. Zach (FreddiePrinze jr.) was just left by his girlfriend. Besides he´s the king of the school. He and his friends make a bet that he won´t find a girl forthe prom night. Zach chooses Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) - she´s an absolute outsider at herschool. But Zach falls in love with her......okay, I admit the story is not new. Otherwise,what do you expect of such a film? Surely not somepretentious stuff! When I have look at all thoseworse 80´s teen flicks  - with the exception of John Hughes´ movies (e.g. "Breakfast club") - thisis one of the best films of this genre. A sweet love story, some  humor and tears  - what do you want more? I agree with the reviewers who say it gets better themore you watch it. Honestly, I enjoyed it more thanin cinema! Besides I loved the dancing sequenceat the prom night. I spent a great night with "She´sall that". This is a cute little movie - give it a chance!!!
