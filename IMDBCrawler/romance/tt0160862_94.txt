Like we havn´t seen this all before! A very non-original movie, about thehot guy at school who makes a bet with a classmate, that he can turn thegeek, Rachael Leigh Cook, into the prom queen. And then of course he fallsin love with her...lame, and all hell brakes lose, when she finds out thatshe´s a bet.I can´t see why people have given this movie an average at 6,0, at thistime. Poor acting, poor story. What is it that I´m not getting in this film,since it get´s this average?  My rating:3 out of 10
