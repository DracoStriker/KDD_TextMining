Yes, I think Rachel Leigh Cook is a hotty, but that might be why I actuallysaw it, for free I might add. This goes to remind me that slip-shodteeny-bopper trash such as this might as well be used to record over,SPOILERS, but it won't take much... Matthew Lilliard is probably the onlyhighlight in this film (except for the step-ins by Lil'Kim and Anna Paquin,who must've simply got paid for having their faces in here) with his danceroutine (hopefully ad-libbed) to "Give It To Me" by Rick James (which wasn'tcredited!!!!). Rather goofy and proud of it, he probably has the onlynatural energy in this flick!!! I'm sure communists would love to make highschool this way, but it simply isn't so. Freddie Prinze Jr.trying to lookintimidating is too silly, if he tried that little stunt in the cafeteriafor real, he'd become ugly and would've never been a poster boy. It wouldstand to reason that teeny-bopper movies should've stayed in stagnationafter the 80's died (nothing much has changed since), this movie is agrossly sugar-coated version of any decent 80's teen-flick, how it got aPG-13 is beyond me. At least an up-to-date carbon copy of "The Principal" or"Lean On Me" would be decent. A 3, it's got gas for a car that takes water.
