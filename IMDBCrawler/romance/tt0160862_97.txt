I swear, if I see one more of these empty, shallow, teeny-bopper flicks, Iwill scream. The great film makers of our time are rolling in their gravesand some aren't even dead yet. How do people get the backing to make thiscrap. This is one of those movies where when you watch it, you think, whyamI staying. Cook is extremely dull as a high school nobody who gets amake-over to be popular. Prinze, although he is great to look at, is alsoboring as the guy who makes Cook over. But that's all he is, eye candy. Theonly positive thing I can say about this is that Mathew Lillard ishilariousas always. His portrayal as an MTV "REAL WORLD" reject is so funny. I warnall people with IQ's higher than their shoe size to stay away from thishorrible film.I give this film * (for Lillard)
