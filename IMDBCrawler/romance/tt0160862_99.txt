Despite the hype about Mr. Prinze, he looks like every male I have evermet.Perhaps he is popular because he is the ultimate in conformity. Theconceptof making Laney acceptable by stripping away elements of her identity andreshaping her image is quite offensive and demeaning. On the one hand,thismovie wants to say that the popular crowd is a bunch of jerks; on theotherhand, it comes out in full support of their tactics of assimilation(nothingunusual or different is tolerable). Other than the offensive plot, themovieis about as average as they come. Fun (if not of the brain-washing,self-esteem destroying brand) for the teeny-boppers, and something forcollege students to laugh at.
