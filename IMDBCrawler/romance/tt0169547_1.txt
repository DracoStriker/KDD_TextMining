American Beauty is the greatest movie ever made.If you haven't already, watch American Beauty by yourself and give yourselfsome time afterwards to think it over. You will never, ever look at lifethesame way. It does exactly what movies are meant to do - give us a windowinto ourselves, and American Beauty does that better than any other filmhasever done. No word of dialogue is unnecessary, no character exaggerated,everything is perfect...but if you have seen American Beauty you shouldknowthat already. Once you look closer at this movie, and see Beauty in everyframe, it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Beauty ineverythingaround you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen themovie. Every character is a part of each of us: the Lester Burnham ofchange, the Carolyn of uncertainty and failure, the rebellion of Jane, thedefeated Barbara, the false control of Angela and the Colonel, and the realcontrol of Ricky. To me Ricky, not Lester, is the center of this story; hesomehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Lester's rebirth anddownfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control everytime I see it, and none more so than the paper bag scene. To me that sceneis simply the greatest monologue ever written.I listened to the message of American Beauty - look closely and you canfindBeauty in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deepdepression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so muchBeautyin the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going toburst.This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.
