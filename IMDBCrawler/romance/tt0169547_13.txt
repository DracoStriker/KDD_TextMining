Ahh, suburbia. That manifestation of mediocrity and anonymity in this, ourpost-industrial society.Where else but in a typical SFR (single-family residential) nestled on atypical tree-lined street in atypical North American suburb can we find someone like LesterBurnham?Where else can the inspiration be found for a movie as ironically sublimeasAmerican Beauty?Burnham is a 42-year-old man who makes a living writing promotionalmaterialfor a magazine that faces downsizing thanks to the excesses of hissuperiors.He is married to Carolyn Burnham, a woman maniacally devoted to making itbig in local realestate, and they have a daughter, Jane, who feels about as significant asplankton floating aboutthe briny deep and about as attractive as a rusty FordPinto.About the only thing that keeps this family together is Burnham'sself-loathing and the mutualhatred heaped upon him by the two women in the house.We're talking about a guy, after all, who starts the morning bymasturbatingin the shower. `Thisis the high point of my day,' he says. `It's all downhill fromhere.'It's pretty obvious that the Burnhams have been somewhat dysfunctional forafew years now.And there's no doubt that Lester is struggling with a mid-life crisis, onethat is expressed in morethan buying a sports car.Things come to a head when Lester develops a lusty obsession for hisdaughter's best friend,replete with life-like dreams of seduction as she lies in a bath of rosepetals. Now Jane has toworry about dear old dad `spraying himself' whenever she brings a friendhome.Meanwhile, Mom has started playing around behind Dad's back with a smoothyet snake-like supersalesman, Buddy Kane. And Jane must come to terms with a rather unique boynext door, whensome new neighbours move in.When Ricky Fitts, the son of a homophobic military man and a roboticallydevoted mother, isn'tdealing marijuana to people like Lester, he's video taping anything andeverything that remotelyinterests him, and he's developing enough footage of Jane to fill the vaultat MGM. Needless tosay Jane is a little freaked about this headcase with an eye for thevisual.As you've probably guessed, the humour can be pretty black in this movie.Indeed, it may not befor everyone, but any accusations that this movie is nothing better thanmean and cynical aresimply unfounded.Instead, taking in American Dream is like biting into the fruit ofknowledge(a.k.a. the apple), theedgy initial sting is followed by a bitter sweet aftertaste.Matters are most assuredly helped by the casting of Kevin Spacey, the kindof middle-aged guythat every middle-aged guy would like to be, in the lead role. And AnnetteBening pulls nopunches as the self-centred career woman whose need to prove self-worthknows no bounds.Indeed, everyone in this movie fits the bill perfectly, right down to themanager of the local SmileyBurger (Dennis Anderson) that Lester turns to for a job after he more thanrefuses to toe thecompany line.In its own way, American Beauty is a humourous tale about a man who finallydecides to come toaccount for his `silly little life' on his own terms regardless of whatthatmeans in appearances.And while the price is heavy, Lester comes out a true hero.As ironically uplifting as it is caustic and acerbic, American Beauty, touse the cliché of enthralledreviewers everywhere, is a must-see movie -- especially for anyone who hasacquired enoughwisdom to know that no matter how old you are, there's plenty of life leftthat's worth living, andplenty of growing up still left to do along the way.
