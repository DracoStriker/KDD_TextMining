This is a profound movie that examines ordinary people.  For all theirflawspeople are basically beautiful and that is one of the many threads of thefabric of this film.  I liked that it was revealed at the start of the filmthat Lester would soon meet his demise.  And I also liked at the ending,theidentity of the person who took his life didn't really matter, just thesadness of the loss of his life.  'Look Closer' was the theme of this movieand Lester even had this motto in his cubical.  Kevin assumed the personaofLester with a range of acting that is quite worthy of awards.  Beninginhabited Carolyn in much the same way.  Which one of us hasn't experiencedthe disillusionment of our teenage years, only to later re-experienced itagain through our children.  And like Carolyn, who among us has not beenintensely disappointed with ourself at some point?  That one scene wasamazing, it looked so real that it transcended acting.  And can a movieactually move beyond entertainment by causing more than absorbingdiscussion, but real change in it's audience?  Perhaps.  But if this istrue, then that movie would be American Beauty.  And for those who feelthismovie doesn't achieve this lofty accolade.  To them I say, "Neverunderestimate the power of denial."  A ten, of course.
