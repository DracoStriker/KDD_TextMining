This piece of sitcommy, cliche-ridden claptrap is just smart enough on itssurface for the middlebrow Academy to pimp it for a Best Picture Oscar. Butanyone with half a brain will see through this tired male fantasy prettysoon. Mendes shows us a Edward Scissorhands-type of suburbia: perfectlawns,identical homes, etc... We are expected to know (since we've seen ES, IceStorm, Happiness, Serial Mom, etc.) that these people must lead shallow,empty lives - look where they live! And... they do! This is just the firstof many obvious themes that we have seen so many times before. And wehaven't even reached Spacey's character's midlife crisis yet. (Surprise! Hefalls in sexual lust with a gorgeous high-school blonde. Sooooo subversive!Look closer, and you'll find even more cliches.) Spacey's wife is,predictably, a self-centered shrew who won't satisfy him sexually but cooksdelicious nutritious dinners and sells (surprise) real estate. His daughteris a misfit (wow!) with whom he can't connect. The new kid on the block (ofcourse there is one) is a weird, sensitive (but handsome) loner type(shocker) who (believe it or not) falls for Spacey's moody daughter. Don;teven ask about the gay neighbors. Mendes does nothing but condescend to hischaracters, his setting, and above all, the audience. Positives: ThoraBirchis terrific and lovely; Mena Suvari is breathtakingly beautiful, and theplastic bag sequence is affecting. Pretentious c***.
