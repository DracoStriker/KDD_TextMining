Much-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia,dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter'sfriend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious.Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it ispopulated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches onwhat the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocreat best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy lovesand awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be bestdescribed as mugging. Benning does not fare much better as hisdesperate wife.
