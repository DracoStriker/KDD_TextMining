What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This movie was one of thefunniest yet most disturbing movies I have seen in a long time.  KevinSpacey gives what may be his best performance  (yes, I thought he wasbetterin this than the Usual Suspects).  The directing was top notch and all theother acting was terrific.  I think this movie paints a good picture as towho we are as people. Not everyone in this world is a perfect, good lookingperson, and this movie plays on that notion.  Everyone should go seeAmerican Beauty.
