A definite addition to my Ten Best List for 1999,  is AMERICAN BEAUTY whichis sure to earn Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning  (robbed in the past for herwork in BUGSY and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT),  and Alan Ball (most originalscreenplay to come along in awhile), Oscar nominations. It is the story ofwhat suburban life and the pursuit of the American Dream can do to anAmerican Family. But unlike the critic's darling from a few years ago ICESTORM, which left me freezing, this film is genuinely funny and moving atthe same time. The ideas projected by director Sam Mendes literally leap offthe screen.  Spacey's edgy performance as the ad exec pushed over the brinkby the pressures of having to have it all and his passion for "The AmericanBeauty"  he missed when he was young enough to enjoy it, offer a visualfeast.  Annette Benning as the Queen of suburbia, Spacey's wife, is  a sortsexy, gorgeous, Martha Stewart gone mad, convinced if she has just one moremotivational seminar she will reach nirvana.  She is in a word "wonderful."The boy next door is sort of cross between Timothy Hutton in ORDINARY PEOPLEand Benjamin in THE GRADUATE.  He deals drugs, observes life around himthrough a video camera and convinces almost everyone that he is the straightarrow next door.  We know immediately, that like everyone else in thismovie, he is not as he appears.  AMERICAN BEAUTY peals away, layer by layer,this oh so imperfect world of suburbia and those in denial who live there.  If you have already seen NOTTING HILL you NEED to see AMERICANBEAUTY.
