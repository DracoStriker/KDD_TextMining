I heard a lot of this movie when it was released on TV, I heard that itwon many prizes, etc., so I decided to watch it. Very provoking, isn'tit? Yep, even my dad changed the channel many times so I didn't watchedsome scenes, but it didn't mattered, I watched the most importantscenes.This movie deserves to be in TOP 250, it's a truly masterpiece, Ilaughed, almost cried too with the ending, and I couldn't stop thinkingin many things of the life. For almost a complete hour I could findbeauty in everything I watched, even in a bag, like in the movie.Yes, the movie will let you thinking in many things, for example, thelife of any person becomes boring when you have sons, a wife orhusband, and a normal life, so, why not to live the life? Theinteresting of this movie is that you can see how many persons live,their wishes, their intelligence, anything.This, my friends, is something that must be called a movie, a reallyMasterpiece that will stay in TOP 250 for a long long time. You knowwhat's a movie? Then you already watched this movie. I really likedthis movie, as many other persons.A TRULY MASTERPIECE: 10/10
