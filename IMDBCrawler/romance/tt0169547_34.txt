I didn't think that much of this movie the first time I saw it. Butcertain images just stuck in my head.I saw it a second time and I really saw it for the first time, anamazing movie. I just watched it for a third time and it just grows andgrows. The story is so simple and short. Yet it has the enjoyment, the journeyof a major novel. I personally hate chick-flicks, am more theaction-adventure type. But there isn't a boring moment in what isreally casually paced.The cinematography and the acting is so well done as to becomeinvisible, just captivating. One of the few films where I never thoughtof any of the actors being "them" playing a part. They are so real.A beautiful journey into a world so foreign, yet so familiar to ourdeepest thoughts.
