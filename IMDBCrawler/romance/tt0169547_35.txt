This movie is the first one I have written a review for, because it isthe one that means the most to me.No word in the English language can give enough praise to do this filmjustice. I could write a whole book about the significance and meaningof every artistic shot, of every remarkable performance, and everyevent and still not capture the essence of this movie.The truth is that this is the most complete portrayal of human emotionand interaction I have ever seen. It encompasses every aspect ofmankind; from jealousy and intolerance, to romance and happiness. Everysingle aspect of each scene has a meaning and message, and if your mindis open, then this movie will affect you in so many ways.On a more technical note, this movie is not only superbly written, butexecuted flawlessly. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of the century,hitting every nuance of his character with grace and style. In a lessermovie, his performance would have been the sole reason to watch. Yetthis is not the case. Annette Benning also shines with her portrayal ofa troubled housewife that is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. The musicalscore also stands out as a fantastic attribute of the experience; notoverpowering, yet still just as relevant.I could go on and on about the flawless cinematography and lightingeffects and such. But I can sum that all up in a different manner:"There is no bad aspect of this film." Everything works together toperfection to provide the most outstanding movie of this age."American Beauty" is quite simply the most significant film of itstime. Yet this movie also transcends time to provide an emotional andthought-provoking experience for years to come.
