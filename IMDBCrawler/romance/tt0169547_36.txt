So much has been said about this movie that it's hard to think of whatelse I could add. I wasn't even going to comment on the film for thisprecise reason, but then I figured I needed to give my favorite film ofall time a shout out.To start, I honestly believe that this is one of the true masterpiecesof the decade. This is a beautifully crafted movie on absolutely everylevel but it's the use and exploration of character throughout thatmakes it truly astonishing. I find each of the characters incrediblyfascinating and very rich. The tagline "Look Closer" is spot on becausethere's always more going on than what you observe on the surface. IfI'm ever missing the beauty in my own world, this is a great work ofart to remind me that I don't have to look very far.
