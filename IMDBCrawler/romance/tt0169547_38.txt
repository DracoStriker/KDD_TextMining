This movie is probably one of the greatest I've seen in my entire life.Every character in this movie plays his/her role phenomenal. A movielike this doesn't come around every so often. This movie deserved everyacademy award that it won (but it did deserve more.) Kevin Spacey playsLester Burnham. This is probably one of the greatest actingperformances in history. If you saw the movie then you would realizewhy I say this.The movie has a very dark tone about it. The theme of this movie goesmuch deeper than you realize, and explains how beautiful and how badlife could be.From Start to finish this is a masterpiece and I strongly recommend it.10/10
