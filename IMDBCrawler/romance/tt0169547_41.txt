I think that it's safe to say that American Beauty and M. NightShyamalan's supernatural-thriller The Sixth Sense were definity thesleeper hits of 1999.Here Kevin Spacey shows the amazing form that he's been showing for thelast ten years, in films like The Life of David Gale, K-PAX, Pay itForward, L.A. Conifedencial and Swimming With Sharks. It's also funnythat this is called an American Classic when the director, Sam Mendez(Road to Perdition), is in fact English.Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a loser who hates his wife (AnnetteBenning- The Grifters, Mars Attacks) and whose daughter (Thora Birch-Patroit Games, Ghost World) hates him, whose life changes when he blackmails his boss, falls for his daughters best friend (Mena Suvari-Atomic Train, American Pie 1 & 2, The Musketeer) and is introduced tothe world of drugs by his neighbour (Wes Bentley).I know wrote in a previous review that I see "To End All Wars as betterfilm-making triumph" and I still stand by that, but you just can't helpbut to be drawn in to this wonderful movie by the amazing Academy Awardwinning combination of Alan Ball's screenplay, Mendez's direction andSpacey performance.
