I found out about this film completely by accident but am so glad Idid. I had seen the trailer and was not that convinced, what made mewant to watch the film was the amazing soundtrack performed mostly byThomas Newman.I was completely hooked from the beginning and was not bored for asecond. American Beauty really is a masterpiece and probably one of thebest films ever to have been made. The film deserves a lot more creditfor the storyline and was directed in an amazing way. Everything isperfectly timed and nothing drags along, it all fits together in agraceful yet unique way. The characters are all part of the jigsaw thatthe story unravels throughout the film to an exciting but shockingconsequence.10 out of 10.
