The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was a very weird movie.The experience quickly faded off, although I that boy-who- records'scharacter intrigued me a little. Yesterday, I chose to give this movieanother watch and I couldn't emphasize enough how drastically myopinion has changed. The second watch helped me form a better view about this. And if it isanything to go by, I believe it is one hell of an anti- establishmentmovie. Almost all the characters are, although seemingly "normal", areliving pathetic lives- all except the boy- who-shoots. It is revealedlater on why he is way ahead of all other characters in terms ofappreciation of "beauty" as he calls it. The film showcases a drastictransformation in the lives of every character. The facades comecrumbling down. All the tightly- knitted culturedness, normalcy's,belief-systems come apart as characters discover how pathetic all theirlives are. The younger generation is more open to changes, the elders-the more they resist change- the more frustrated they become. Meanwhileit is revealed that the most straight-jacketed (in terms ofconservative notions like homosexuality, marriage, discipline) is asecret admirer of fascism and the most sorrowful character. Slowly, asall the characters let go and accept their natural feelings, instincts,desires- sometimes bordering on scandalous- they feel better, relaxed,happier. All but one is transformed. The film describes how heavy orthodox beliefs can get, how they havethe power of consuming people's lives, harming people. The film, forme, is an acute critique of all means of classifying things intobinaries. It endorses a more tolerant view of life and portrays theinsidious nature of judgments. I loved it and would watch it again,soon.
