I've had an account for close to 2 years now and after watching thisfilm I felt the need to write my first review. To sum up 'AmericanBeauty' in one word would be near impossible, Kevin Spacey's portrayalas the sick to death suburban husband and father who's desperatelytrying to figure out when and where it all went wrong is undoubtedlyOscar worthy on it's own merits, but as we all know Spacey alwaysbrings something to the table that others can't offer.He takes us through a journey of mid-life self discovery and is able toaccomplish what many forty-something ordinary..unhappy, bored with lifehusbands and fathers cannot, he's the feeling in your gut, he's thevoice in the back of your head, telling you to do it, do what would endthe misery and open yourself to the beauty of the world.To watch this film for the first time 15 years after it's release andit still have an effect on the viewer says a lot for the film itself,it is becoming increasingly difficult for anything pre-2000 to stayrelevant, especially in this modern mess of a world but 'AmericanBeauty' delves into both adolescent and adult life with the tag line'...look closer' being so subtle yet so pertinent.Coming into a review it is incredibly important to remain objective,but of course if one is writing passionately it may appear subjective,reading a lot of negative reviews about 'American Beauty' it appearsone of the main critical points made is that the film is full ofcliché's, or is described as one big cliché. It's not hard to see wherethese opinions come from but it's important to realise that not allgreat films need to be bursting with taboo matters and subjects,sometimes the simpler stories are the most eye opening...'American Beauty' along side 'Fight Club' in my opinion is one of themost life affirming films that I have had the pleasure of watching,teaching that there's so much beauty in the world, in places and thingsyou would never even think to look twice at, you've just got to beready, and willing to be in that place, where you've not nothing tolose.To reiterate, 'American Beauty' cannot be summed up in one word, youjust have look closer, if you're ready.
