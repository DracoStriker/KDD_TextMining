I was honestly amazed at how beautiful this movie came out and havebeen trying to find a movie similar in feel but all fall very short.This movie is simply extremely unique and makes the viewers really seethe different perspectives of lives that cross each other. It is chaosin the most beautiful way. I didn't expect the plot to be ever soentertaining. Every shot was honestly beautiful and the soundtrack isheavenly; so well put together and I honestly recommend for any type ofview who enjoy movies which make you think. Even to a certain degreedid I feel that we were living through the characters and it justgenerally had something to say on the nature of man.
