You may read the little summary on the film up above and look at themovie poster and make assumptions about this movie, but the descriptionis misleading. I know it was for me because when I finally watched themovie I was pleasantly surprised. This is one of those few movies thatyou will remember what you were doing while you watched it. The mainpoint of the movie is not directly tied to the description up above -it is something that you will figure out for yourself..if you watch themovie. American Beauty is a breed of movie all its own, and should bewatched with care- however silly that sounds. Overall, just watch it.Kevin Spacey's narration is perfect for this movie and he really addsto his character.
