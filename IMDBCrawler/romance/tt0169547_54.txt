American Beauty is the epitome of perfect emotional cinema. It boastsgreat direction, screen writing and performances all round, making it,in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made.The story follows Lester Burnham, a man who seems to have lost all hopein life, as he is stuck in a joyless marriage and has troubleconnecting with his teenage daughter. This all changes when he meetsAngela, his daughter's best friend. From then on, Lester decides totake back control of his life. The question is, how will it affectthose around him?Kevin Spacey gives a career defining performance and once again nailsit as Lester, a man so fed up with life that he needed a radicalchange. The evolution of the character is done to perfection andSpacey's Oscar winning work is the proof. All other actors do theirparts in great fashion as well and make the movie even better. Withinspired performances like these, the film only gets better with amagical combination of Alan Ball's script and Sam Mendes' debut as acinematic director. Among other things I love about this film, I can'tgo on without mentioning the heart wrenching soundtrack that pulls outa wallop of emotions.American Beauty is a wonderful, yet ultimately tragic tale of howpeople can hide their true selves. However they choose to change, onething is certain: it will affect everything in the status quo. Lester'sstory is the example of that and it is one that I will heartedlysupport every time I watch this movie.Rating: 10/10
