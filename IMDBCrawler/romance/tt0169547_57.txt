Whether you like it or not, you always watch a movie with anexpectation. I didn't know much about this movie, and expected a sleazyand cheap flick about a horny old man. I have to say - I got a lot morethan I asked for. I got a movie so filled with life lessons, so rich inso many ways, that I think it spoke to me. I loved the characters inthis movie. The one that sees all the beauty in the world. Thefrustrated middle-aged man that is not happy with his life. The toughguy that does not know how to handle the social situations and problemshe and his family is facing. I loved the music. I loved how it toldsuch an important story with at times comedic means. Although I mighthave preferred a different ending, it still felt right.I don't know if you will like it. You might well hate it. It probablydepends on your expectations. I know one thing for sure, though: Thismovie is the work of spectacular minds. It is a movie for people thatlike to think. And if you did not think before you started it, I betyou will when you are finished.
