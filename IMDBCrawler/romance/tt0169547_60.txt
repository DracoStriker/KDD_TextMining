This is truly a classic movie for those people who appreciate real artwhen watching films. The movie is basically all about the lives ofAmerican suburbanites but put in a very realistic way. This is a greatpsychology movie because it shows a large amount of information ondevelopmental processes. The acting and the dialogue in the movie areof course the best part. The movie is primarily based on Kevin Spacey'srole which he captures and absolutely stunned me when seeing him. WesBently was also very good. It's his script that really moved me andmade me think hard about life after hearing some things he said. It'struly a wonderfully well made movie. A good drama and good thing towatch for those of you studying psych in school.
