this movie is as moving and insightful as a fart. the director and hisactors have no grasp whatsoever of the human condition. instead ofgiving an accurate or interesting snapshot of humanity they chose tocreate some sort of suburban nightmare and allow a bunch of hateful andinhumane people inhabit it. the scene wherein the paper blowing aroundis filmed and called "beautiful" by one of the "actors" in this flicksums it up for me. i.e. if you call it beauty, then people will want tofawn over, look and act like it. in this case, and in the case of themovie, it was just trash. you and i were scammed. and the academy didits usual part by praising this garbage to the sky. only in the case oftitanic has a movie been less deserving of an award.
