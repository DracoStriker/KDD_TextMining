By no means a bad movie, AB is nevertheless a film that suffers from it'sown self awareness.  One cannot help but feel preached at much of the timewhich, at least for me, grew wearisome.  The stereotypes are irksome, aswell.  This movie joins the long list of "Oscar winners" that were not thebest picture of their year.
