A transcendant, beautiful film about suburban decay circa late 1990s. Darkcomedy mixes wonderfully well with serious drama, creating a dreamy thoughrealistic narrative sprinkled liberally with fantasy. Spacey has never beenbetter; his range and delivery are amazing. Equally deft supporting workfrom Bening, Suvari, and Cooper, with Birch and Bentley creating a lovely,nuanced young couple that is rooted in their individual and collectiveuniqueness. A fiercely strong debut for director Mendes.
