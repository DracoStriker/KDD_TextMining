I am Lester Burnham. Well, I'm 42 and I've been married for 15 years. Idon't think one has to see themselves in this film to appreciate it, but howcan I know? One comment I'd like to make as a reader of books about writing--AmericanBeauty is a model for how to take derivative concepts, or specific textbookinstructions, and make a unique mix that is art for the ages. The film owesmuch to "Sex, Lies and Videotape"; some to "Ordinary People" and "The IceStorm." Others have pointed out that the "from beyond the grave" narrationis not original. Every book on dramatic writing quotes Tolstoy: "If there isa gun hanging on the wall in Act One, it had better be fired by the end ofAct Two." And yet this particular blending of these ideas is new. If you'veever tried to create a story or a song and you became frustrated that youwere just borrowing ideas, perhaps you'll understand why American Beauty issuch a role model for me.It's hard not to become more introspective and more honest with yourselfafter seeing this movie and I think that makes it great.
