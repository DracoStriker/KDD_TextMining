I saw American Beauty last night and I can't stop thinking about it. Itwasone of the best movies I have seen in quite awhile.I don't want to give anything away so I'm  just going to give sometidbits.The acting was brilliant. Kevin Spacey was in his best form, I reallythinkthis is the perfect role for him. Annette Bening was great, and her hairwaseven better. I'm not real familiar with Wes Bentley, but his portrayal ofRicky Fitts was spectacular.The direction by Sam Mendes was beautiful. He created such a great feelandvision it's hard to not want to see it again just for the images. I thinkschools should consider showing this movie to film students to show themhowto completely create a mood with such few gimmicks. The mood Mendescreatedmade me laugh and feel uncomfortable at the same time. I guess it was alittle bit like the way we all feel about life itself, which is what themovie is about anyway.You must see this movie if you are serious about film, and you should seethis movie if you still like to be moved by a brilliantstory.
