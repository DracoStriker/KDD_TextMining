I saw an early screening of this phenomenal movie and it blew me away.Thereare laugh-till-you cry moments, especially as Kevin Spacey goes throughtheearly stages of his midlife crisis. But the harshness and exquisitetenderness of life in all its glory are never far from the center of thestory. Anyone with a family will be able to relate to the film.
