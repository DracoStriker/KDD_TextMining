I saw a sneak preview of American Beauty recently and all I can say is thatI intend to see it again.  This is a WONDERFUL movie that is worth themoneyto see in the theaters (the only movie I've been to where half the audiencebroke into applause during the film).  Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a manwho,while going through a mid-life crisis, begins to lust after a teenagefriendof his daughter's.  Spacey is, of course, a fabulous actor and reallyshinesin this role.  There are a few interwoven story lines involving Spacey'srelationship with his control freak wife (Annette Bening, who is good if alittle bit over the top in this role) and daughter, and the family nextdoor, which includes a military general father, a mother who is apparentlyclinically depressed, and a very interesting son who is obsessed withfilming beautiful things (including Lester's daughter Jane).  What isunusual about this movie is that the plot is not unusual or particularlyunique--it's a couple of families in an anonymous American suburb and howthey relate--but the filming of the movie is absolutely beautiful, and isdone in a way that makes the film alternately hilarious, heartbreaking, andhorrific.  It is definitely for mature audiences--there is some violenceanda couple of frontal nudity scenes (both of which are essential and verytastefully done)--but older teens might enjoy it as well.  Be wary of howthe media chooses to portray this movie--it may be called a "black comedy,"but, while sometimes hilarious, it is definitely a drama.  Go see it--Idon't think you'll be sorry.
