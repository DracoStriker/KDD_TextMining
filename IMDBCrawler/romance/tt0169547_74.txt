The title of the movie says it all. Beauty is all this movie is about,beautiful actors, director, script, production, screenplay, soundtrack,and everything else that contribute with this movie is beautiful. Iloved how they turned simple things, such as a family (that in thiscase is what the movie is based on), and turn it into somethingabsolutely amazing. If you read the word "beutiful" or "beauty" manytimes, well its because its true, everything is, literally everythingis pure beauty. The performances held by the actors and actress areincredible, specially Kevin Spacey's and Annette Bening's. They did andexcellent work together. It felt as if they shared the spotlight, whatI mean with this is that they sort of trade it, at one time you couldsee how Kevin lets Annette make a wonderful performance and"viceversa". That little touch of the red roses was absolutelyincredible. Also the character who filmed everything and even if it wasa plastic bag somehow they made them sound as if it was the mostbeautiful thing ever. I couldn't get over this movie for like a week,it really amazed me, I fell in love with it. Maybe its because thisfilm is my favorite movie, or maybe its because everything the put inthis movie is fantastic, but practically everyone who has seen thismovie, and specially if you like classics, good movies, that deserve tobe recognized by the history of excellent movies.
