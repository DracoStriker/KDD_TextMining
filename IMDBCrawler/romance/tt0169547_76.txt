I am writing this review for American Beauty after the third time inthree weeks that I have watched it and it grows on me each time I watchit. The first time I watched it, I thought maybe this movie is more ofa comedy than a drama but after watching it today, I can say this isdefinitely a drama with some funny moments in it which is what I wantfrom a drama rather than it taking itself too seriously. Kevin Spacey,who is simply brilliant stars as Lester Burnham , a sexuallyfrustrated, average American husband/father who is undergoing amid-life crisis as he hates his job and his relationships with his wifeCarolyn (played superbly by Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (ThoraBirch) are strained due to a number of reasons, one being that hebecomes attracted to his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes (MenaSuvari). Add to that, the arrival of their new neighbours, the Fits,Frank (Chris Cooper), Ricky (Wes Bentley) and Barbara (Allison Janney)who seem to have problems of their own. All of these intertwining storylines, acting, music, directing and the script make this movie, in myopinion, an underrated classic of the 1990's which churned out somegreat movies and what a way to end the decade with a fantastic moviesuch as this. Hard for me to find a negative with this movie butpositives from the movie are the storyline, the beautiful music andscore of the movie, directing and of course, the cast of the moviewhich won the SAG Best Ensemble Award. With the cast, everyone knewtheir roles in the movie and played them accordingly, Kevin Spacey asthe lovable loser, Annette Bening as the ambitious and materialisticwife, Thora Birch as the self esteem-less daughter and in one of herfirst big roles, Wes Bentley as Ricky, the likable next door neighbourwho loves his camcorder and Jane's friend, Chris Cooper as Col Fits, ahomophobic, strict disciplinarian father, Allison Janney as the silentwife, Mena Suvari as the egotistical best friend and even PeterGallagher as Carolyn's real estate rival, Buddy Kane. This filmdeserved it's Oscar's for Best Picture, Best Director (Sam Mendes),Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography as well as the othernominations including Best Actress-Annette Bening but in saying that, Ithought the acting standouts besides the two leads could have beennominated as well including Best Supporting Actress- Thora Birch orBest Supporting Actor- Chris Cooper who put in one of the performancesof the year 1999 and has stuck with me ever since or Wes Bentley;either one, take your pick, they were both great.
