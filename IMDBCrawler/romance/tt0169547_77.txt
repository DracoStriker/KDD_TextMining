I've seen this one a few times before, and I never liked it as much asI did the first time; that probably had something to do with certainpositive circumstances I can't go into here. In any case, 'AmericanBeauty' has a couple of fine scenes that always greatly amuse me. Youknow, Angela's dance, the dance of the plastic bag and Jane and Ricky'sintimate moments for instance.At many other moments, though, I wish Sam Mendez had toned it downconsiderably. Now it feels much like an over-stylized pastiche ofconcentrated misery with too many angles (i.e. characters). A lot ofdialogue (and monologue) feels too contrived, as does the whole story -though some of it works really well, I must add. So I can't say thatit's a bad film, but for a black comedy it isn't always sharp and funnyenough and for a drama it doesn't go deep enough, mainly because it hastoo many things going on.And then there is Kevin Spacey. I love him in films such as 'Se7en' or'The Usual Suspects' where he plays no less than iconic bad guys, buthere there are only bits and pieces that really convince me. Most otheractors are quite convincing, like Gary Cooper, but his role ofhomophobic, militaristic (helpless) husband and father is one of those'things' that feel so overly contrived - though, again, there is a lotof potential.6 out of 10.
