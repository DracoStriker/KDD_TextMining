American Beauty is a film that exposes the secrets and unrulypredicaments of a suburban American family.My reaction to American Beauty can be summarized into one word--spectacular, as what Kevin Spacey said in the movie. The movie combinesdifferent genres to form a very interesting mix-- drama, suspense andcomedy.American Beauty is definitely praise-worthy, especially with the waythe story went. The characters' lives get messed up in veryunpredictable ways that will make the viewer stick till the end. Thealternating mix of comedy, drama and suspense work under the spell ofthe beautiful score.The characters are also a secret to the film's beauty. Thenot-so-usual-but-really-interesting characters are well-complementedwith outstanding acting, especially Kevin Spacey, who I think did agood job in portraying a fed-up father who loses it.Final say? American Beauty is definitely Best Picture quality. It isable to capture the dark side of suburban America while providingviewers with witty laughs.
