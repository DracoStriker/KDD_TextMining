My new favorite movie! I would never have watched this movie outside ofmy high school Film Studies class. But the first two minutes of thefilm seemed to have got my attention. I felt that the tone of the moviewas really interesting. Most of the film was quiet and wasn't actionpacked like most movies that typical high schooler's watch. In thebeginning, the movie was really mellow and then slowly the intensitystarted to build up. The thing that helped make the movie so great wasthe music. It's a type of music I can't explain. It gave the movie thatcertain tone that it has.The characters in the movie were great! And if Lester was played bysomeone other than Kevin Spacey, the film would not be as good. I loveLester Burnham, he's so laid back, he doesn't really get angry at all.He only loses his temper one time in the movie and I found it hilariousbecause it was so random.It's just a great movie, you have to watch it!
