Sam Mendes does a great job showing the troubles and problems ateenager might go through during their high school career. I'd have tosay that this movie was more based around the father's life and hisproblems with it. Mendes really portrays well what a troubled fatherready to give it all up might do to get things to go his way. Thecreepy neighbor boy was a bit far fetched but added the third part ofthe story that i believe it needed. The use of roses was amazing andwere perfect for the times they were used. the cast for this was aperfect selection. Kevin Spacey played a perfect role as the miserablefather/husband. Thora Birch was the best choice for a wanna populardark teenager. Overall this was a great movie to watch and one worthits time.
