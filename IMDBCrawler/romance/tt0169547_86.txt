Giving the 10 i say all. This movie is one of the best i've seen all mylife long. It's scarily, see the reality like this. The romance betweenRicky Fits and Jane Burnham... without words. The first time i saw it,i begun to think in everything can happen in the planet and we don'texpect. All the bad actions, the secrets, the lies, the supposedbeauty... perfection. That's not beauty. I think the movie just... stayin the brain and the thoughts of everyone who see it. Something sostressing in the film: Ricky's father. That man is just so crazy,trying his son and wife like this... and he kills one man just to keepshiding his secret.
