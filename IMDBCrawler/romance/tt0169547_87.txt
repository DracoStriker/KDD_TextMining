I am the lone soldier who didn't like this movie....and it had all themakings of something I'd really love.Perhaps if I'd watched it alone...but watching it with others made mefeel a little uncomfortable. Why...I don't know. Possibly because themovieopened with a guy jerking it in the shower. I'm not a prude by anymeans...but honestly this movie was just a little weird for me.  Call meuncultured, lacking in taste...I really don't care. The movie wasn't awfulor anything....it just made me squirm.
