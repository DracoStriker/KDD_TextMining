I have this movie on DVD and I watch it over and over again, and Alan Balland Sam Mendes have shown me the omphh that has been missing in other filmsfor a long time. I subscribe to a lot of the accolades to this film, but Ido not think that it deserved Best Picture. It was an excellent film- butnot an important one. As a kid, I grew up in suburban Orange County wherethere was truly a lot more than what seemed. I've seen comments posted thatstate that all of the "corruption" just isn't there: "fascist, repressedMarine Corps colonels; middle-aged men obsessed with high school girls;drugdistribution amongst teenagers; etc." Well, I have news for those soccermoms who like to live in their hermedically sealed worlds and listen toCeline Dion- "LOOK CLOSER"! Kevin Spacey deserved Best Actor and AnnetteBening was quite impressive as the two-faced housewife. The supportingcharacters were just as good and this movie never seemed to drag. It is notfor everyone: it is unsettling, disturbing and somewhat raw. But a majorityof conservative societies don't want the kind of in-your-face dynamic whichthis movie has. Well, okay. That's why they have movies like "StuartLittle."
