American Beauty is a great movie about beauty. Everything you see in thismovie is beautiful, even those which seem ugly. Kevin Spacy acts Lestercharacter delicately and beautifully. The script is so powerful containinggreat dialogues mixed with remarkable scenes. Some scenes are unforgettable.for instance, the scene in which Ricky shows the most beautiful thing he hadever filmed. This scene is so touching. In fact, the whole movie istouching. I felt every characters in the movie. And at last, the name of themovie is some kind of a metaphor. Because American Beauty is the name of thevariety of hybrid rose.(according to Webster Dictionary) Spielberg has founda new talent again(Sam Mendes) and of course Sam has done a great job forhis movie directing debut. The film deserved to gain 100 oscars instead ofone for best picture. Thanks to Alan Ball and all who were involved inmaking this special and beautiful movie.
