I saw this film on a whim and was more than pleasantly surprised. The storyline is incredible, and rather realistic. Kevin Spacy's acting iswonderful,as it is all around. I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Spacy livesthe suburban (as well as my own) nightmare. His character is so believablethat I could swear he was me. A wonderful, yet darkly uplifting,movie.
