It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in characterthat I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it isa story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself,opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn.But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it isimpossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes youfeel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turnedon, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinemacan be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is,perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. LoveActually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered bylanguage or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all ofthe above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrificscript. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience;not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience thefilm. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothingmore of them left.**** (A)
