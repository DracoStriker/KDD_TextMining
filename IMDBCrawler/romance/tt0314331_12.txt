Love Actually is movie that helps you see how life redefine's it self.Common and extraordinary lives are mixed together with such good tastethat you tend to believe that you were probably wrong the last time youwere angry because of someone else doings.The cast gave us outstanding performances by Hugh Grant, Liam Neesomand Emma Thompson and characters (the rock star and his manager arejust persons to love!).Special chapter for the charming Keira Knightley that just have awayherself... and that is to say probably a person very similar to thegeneral and popular idea of what angel's are.A movie just perfect to believe in love again.
