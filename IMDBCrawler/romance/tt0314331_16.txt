Conclusively, without doubt, undeniably, unmistakably, unquestionablyand irrevocably THE worst movie I have ever seen in my life.The only reason I was able to sit through it is that I couldn't lookaway from this horrific car crash that injured so many fine actors (notto mention a handful of appalling no-names).On the few occasions that my nausea subsided, it was brought back witha vengeance by the unbelievably bad music selection, the piece deresistance being the primary school's blood-curdling rendition ofMariah Carey's 'All I Want For Christmas'.Every time you think the film can't get any worse, it somehow managesto, which is quite a mean feat I must say...
