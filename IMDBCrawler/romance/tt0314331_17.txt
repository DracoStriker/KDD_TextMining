It's films like this that makes you despise what cinema has become - amanipulative medium that contrives a formula to tap into your base emotionswith a painting-by-numbers banality.  Richard Curtis uses every clichéd,over-used, underdefined character from his big book of cardboardcaricatures, then gets all his tired old thesp-chums to appear in it andchurn out this sugar-sweet isn't-the-world-wonderful-even-when-you-think-it-isn'trubbish - and then has the audacity to stick it in the cinemas of the worldand charge an entrance fee.  How long must we tolerate this self-indulgenttravesty from a man who is the king of the dumbing-down rom-com.Notting Hill and Love Actually should forever be consigned to video bargainbucket hell.
