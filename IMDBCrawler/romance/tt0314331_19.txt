One of the worst films its been my misfortune to see - I saw it for free andstill wanted my money back. Smug middle class trash and one of the mostmanipulative films it's been my misfortune to sit through. The opening 9/11reference was unbelievably crass and offensive and it was downhill fromthere. The saving grace was Laura Linney but her character just seemed to bediscarded when Richard Curtis couldn't seem to contrive a way to get herback into the plot. Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson have both shownhow multiple storylines can be handled to amazing effect - evoking a genuineemotional response from the audience. Richard Curtis just strings together afew popular scenes from his other scripts, desperately trying to squeeze alaugh or tear from the audience. Depressingly this is one of the mostsuccessful UK films ever - despite having little or no resemblance to anyLondon that actually exists. I think the audience's reaction will bedifferent in hindsight when, on a second viewing, they realise they've beenhad.
