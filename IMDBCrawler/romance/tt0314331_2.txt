This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characterswho are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what --this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- justlike It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most peoplelove those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of thisfilm. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such itshould not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would betterbe directed toward something terrible that masquerades as seriousdramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door withjust one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is"number one for Christmas" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriouslydoubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promotersactually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to betaken as a "serious" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take itfor the fantasy that it is. I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like thecharacters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job. I caught itfirst in theatrical release, then I watched it three times back to backon a plane to London because the other choices were the abysmal"Cheaper by the Dozen" and "Duplex." Since I've caught it on HBO, andI've quickly realized it's one of those movies you can watch repeatedlywhen flipping channels for a quick "pick me up" that only fantasymovies can provide. My favorite movie of that sort is Groundhog Day, ifthat clues you into my argument. The multi-threaded storytelling in this borrows from the likes ofMagnolia, and the fact that it's a light hearted holiday theme flickplace that device in interesting contrast. I see Love Actually as a new holiday classic.
