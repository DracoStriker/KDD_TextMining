I only watched this film because it was the in-flight movie on a longtrip to South Africa, and I have a fear of flying. I tried to use ittake my mind off the terror. I have never had to use the sick bag on anairliner before, but I very nearly did here, on account of thisoverwhelmingly schmaltzy, vomit-inducing, more awful than awful,drivel. I don't know what has happened to Richard Curtis. Once upon atime he was one half of the writing team that brought us the brilliant,the very clever and imaginative BlackAdder series. And now he appearsonly able to produce harmless, clichéd, politically correct humdrumstuff, vaguely funny if you've been hiding in a hole for the last 80years.This is the man who has brought us such not-funny turkeys as Mr. Beanand The Vicar of Dibley. And now he's gone a step further backwards andwritten and directed something that is so sentimental, so nice andcuddly that it's downright offensive! It insults it's audience,especially when they are forced to watch it in a metal tube 20,000 feetin the air.Bill Nighy plays a mature rock star who uses expletives a lot. That'san example of the highly intellectual comedic content. That's funny?Then there's the nonsense. Stuff that has no roots in the real world,no link with an intelligent audience. For instance there's a pre-teenkid, who's supposedly in love. We're supposed to believe in him? We'resupposed to care about the deluded little tyke? Then there's a PrimeMinister, who's attractive, single, and a really nice guy!! Ahhh, howlovely! Arrgghh, I can't stand it! Open the doors! Let me out!Get me away from this unbelievable Schmaltz!
