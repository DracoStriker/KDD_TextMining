This film is simply terrible. It tries to be romantic, and failsmiserably.It tries to be funny - ditto. There are a number of key failures - One: dowe really need this many characters, of which only one moved me to anydegree, that being the American women with the mentally disturbed brother?Two: the cliche-o-meter almost hits the roof. Say no more. Three - maybeitsbecause I'm a bloke, but i just didn't care less what happened to anyone -there was zero character development. And finally, there was no reasonwhatsoever why the characters they all need to be somehow interrelated, asit adds nothing at all to the film like, for example, Pulp Fictionsucceedsin doing. All in all, a true reflection on what a British romantic comedyshould not be.
