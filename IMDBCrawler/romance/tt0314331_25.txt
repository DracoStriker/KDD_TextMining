After seeing this I wanted to inflict actual bodily harm on RichardCurtis. I'm not joking. I really, really did. Love Actually is thevilest, most ghastly, most putrid film I have ever seen. It isappalling. The nadir of Curtis's output, it is a toe-curlingabomination. Where to start? What about the pure, undiluted cynicism ofthe enterprise, evident in everything from the music to themanipulative sentimentality to the use of children to the Christmassetting. It's a film with no heart, no structure, no sense, just aseries of orchestrated, contrived scenes, augmented by the odd stalecomic line (eg 'Now I can only get into dresses that belonged toPavarotti') and utterly stupid improbabilities. To go through thosewould take way, way too long. And what's with the use of bad languagein the most inappropriate of situations? Do not see this vomit-inducingturkey of a movie, especially in a couple if you're a man because itmay well end your relationship, which would actually be quite ironic,eh Mr Curtis?
