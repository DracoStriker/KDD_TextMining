This is one of my new favorite movies. I don't know how i have beenliving without this movie. A kind of original plot and an all star cast,i mean, we are talking: Keira Knighley, Laura Linney, Hugh Grant, LiamNeeson, Emma Thompson, Rowan Atkinson, and TONS of other hugecelebrities. This is a real heartwarming movie. Tons of humor andbeauty for the whole family (well, if they are aloud to see it). Allleading up to a great climax. And it shows some of the beauty that theworld does have. And that love ACTUALLY is all around. I swear, if youdon't see this movie, someone will kick you. Ask any one around. I wastalking about this today at school and it was one of my teachersfavorite movies. It also kind of redefines stereotypes and everything.Please, if you see one movie in your life, let it be this.
