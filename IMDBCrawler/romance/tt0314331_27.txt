I really didn't know they made movies like this anymore... it's been along time since I could honestly say that here is a movie worth seeing,renting, owning. They really didn't leave anything out. They coveredall their bases on this one. As a Romance Novel Reader, and as aRomance/Comedy Buff, I say I AM IMPRESSED. And I thank whoever wrotethe script and hope he's a happy man, as he has made me happy everytime I watch this. It made me laugh, and cry, and hope, and dream.There was love actually everywhere. Not to mention the fact that I amPortuguese and so did not need to read the subtitles to understandthose beautiful scenes in Marseilles. How beautifully written thiswas!!! I applaud. My co-workers applaud, my family and friends to whomI recommended this movie to applaud...
