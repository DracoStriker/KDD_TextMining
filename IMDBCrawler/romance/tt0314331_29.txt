I've always known I'm out of step with most of the people I meet, butcan I be the only person who not only detests this film with anintensity bordering on the psychotic, but who finds it utterlyoffensive, on every level, from first frame to last? Never have Iexperienced such strong emotions about a film, and it leaves me almostspeechless with anger just to hear its title. To hear someone actuallypraise the thing causes me to weep with frustration and I often have tobite my tongue to prevent myself from delivering a tirade of eruditecriticism to complete strangers. Why should this be? Could it be thewell documented, revolting (and believe it or not, largely unnoticed,among UK cinema goers I have asked at least!)reference to 9/11? Theillogical behaviour of characters for the sake of a cheap laugh? Thegratuitous use of pornography, in a stomach-churningly smug 'hey, pornis just harmless fun' middle class liberal unthinking kind of a way?The casual anti-Americanism, the embarrassing dialogue given to 'saltof the earth' working class stereotypes, the utter, utter completenonsense of the plot in every single one of the 'stories'? Don't get mestarted. I thought Notting Hill was bad enough, with its brave crippleand her eternally patient husband. Here we had Emma Thomson lookingbalefully noble as she endured not only her husband's infidelity, butthe sound of Joni Mitchell cruelly betraying one of her own children.And as for the brat with Liam Neeson? Why wasn't he shot by airportsecurity, as he would have been in reality or any halfway decent film,and which he, and Richard Curtis, so richly deserved. Otherwise, it wasokay.
