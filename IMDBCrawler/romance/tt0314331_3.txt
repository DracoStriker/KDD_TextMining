This was a most intriguing film. There are of course other reviews ofit here, but the one common theme that seems to exist in all reviews isthe simple fact that you can never please all the people all of thetime.For myself I loved the film and the way that all the stories wereintertwined. You could spend ages just trying to work out where thevarious connections between the story lines actually were.But there were two very special moments for me in this film. One waswhere Mark (Andrew Lincoln) finally told Juliet(Keira Knightley ) howhe REALLY felt about her, through the medium of the messages on thecards, (surely many of us have experienced that sort of unrequitedlove), the other was the brilliant brief speech given by the PrimeMinister (Hugh Grant) to the press conference at which the AmericanPresident was present. (Both of these appear as quotes elsewhere onthis site.) I felt that it was a very brave move on the part of thewriter (Richard Curtis) to allow the Prime Minister in the film tostate what so many ordinary British people are feeling about Americaand its politics right now. I also feel that we, the British, are finally beginning to move awayfrom under the Hollywood shadow, and are starting once again to producesome really excellent films of our own. And for me, this film justunderlines this fact. May this trend continue. Claire Rosemary Jane.
