I am your typical male. I like sports movies, action movies,gore/horror movies. So when I sat down and watched Love Actually, I wasa bit biased. The title gives the impression that this is a chickflick. It is. What the title does not tell you is that this is afantastic film. Not just for women (or overly emotional men), but foreveryone. If you've ever been in love, if you ever hope to be, if younever think it will happen to you, this film is for you.The relationships that are portrayed are so real. This film made mewant to yell at the TV (yes, I watched it first after it came out onDVD). I wanted to root for some characters, yell at others, and cry forthe rest.It has been a long time (maybe ever) since I cried during a movie.However, when Karen opens her gift and it is NOT the necklace, I felther pain. The way the film moves between relationships and sets you up,is masterful.This is the best holiday/relationship/comedy film I've ever seen!Highly Recommended!
