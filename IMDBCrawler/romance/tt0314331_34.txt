Richard Curtis is a terrific writer. I'm not convinced he can writeanything properly dramatic or serious, but he has proved again andagain that he has a wonderful knack for comedy, where his televisionwork on the likes of "Blackadder" and "The Vicar of Dibley" hasoccasionally outshone his fantastic work on films like "Four Weddingsand a Funeral" and "The Girl in the Cafe". Curtis is also a goodfantasy writer. No, not fantasy in the Lord of the Rings sense, fantasyas done in Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life". "Love Actually" is abeautiful, touching, and genuinely affecting romantic fantasy in whichthe bits of humor work extremely well."Love Actually" works so well as a narrative for several reasons, oneof them being that it's fairly unique. The easiest way to describe itwould be 'interlocking', but that would sadly put it in the company oftrash like Paul Haggis' abortion of a movie "Crash" and Inarritu'ssimilarly unsuccessful "Babel". "Love Actually" is best described as aseries of vignettes about various varieties of love.The star-studded cast don't exactly have to act their hearts out butthey work perfectly together, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy being the mostaffecting actors in the film. The film is not especially remarkablevisually, but it is satisfyingly well-shot. Curtis' script is nothingshort of brilliant, at least until the final scenes. If "Love Actually"has flaws, they come in those final scenes. They are certainlycontrived, but the rest of the movie does such a good job drawing youin that you barely notice it at the end. This is a remarkable film, onethat is hard to forget.9/10
