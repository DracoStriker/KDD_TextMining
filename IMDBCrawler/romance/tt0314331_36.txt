The plot is facile and irritating and would probably only appeal to thosewith  infinite tolerance for movies that have weak plots, shallowcharacters, and sappy nonsense. My wife, who likes "chick flicks" couldn'tstand this movie either. First movie in a long time (the last one being"Spawn") that I was so  irritated that I strongly considered demanding mymoney back.
