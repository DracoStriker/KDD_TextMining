Of course this was run on TV in these Christmassy times and I wasmasochistic enough to give it another go. The posters in the hateit-section have summed it all up already I know, but even I repeat themI feel the urge to share with the world what got on my nerves most: Thesilly Colin Firth "love story", Hugh Grant as PM is truly unbearable,the guy wooing his best friends wife, the VO in the beginning, I couldgo on forever. Question is why Rickman, Thompson and Ejiofor(screentime about two minutes) wasted their talent on this dreck. OnlyNighy is fun to watch, his cynicism about his record should be appliedto this sort of movie.
