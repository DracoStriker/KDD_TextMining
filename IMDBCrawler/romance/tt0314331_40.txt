I went expecting a mindless bit of fun and found myself cringing for morethan two hours. All these nice actors must be appalled to see themselvesimplicated in this disaster. The script is simply incoherent, with holes youcould drive a truck through. From the hideous child love story to theappalling musical numbers to the preposterous plot twist involving thepresident of the United States, these writers have a great deal to answerfor. No form of pandering is too low. Those battling holiday depression,beware: this debacle will leave you contemplating suicide.
