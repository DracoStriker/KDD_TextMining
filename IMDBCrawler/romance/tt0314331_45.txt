Its totally different to most others in the genre, it stereotypes theclichés and then mocks them beautifully, it explores different types oflove, couples, married couples, kinship, business relationships, etc.There's actually eight stories in this film, some cross over, someblend together and some stand alone, but they all play wonderfully; andthe humour is consistent from start to finish.Littered with top names, and scripted by the brilliant Richard Curtis-Love Actually breaks the mould of the romantic comedy genre whileremaining totally appealing to the fans of the tradition.8/10 Brilliant
