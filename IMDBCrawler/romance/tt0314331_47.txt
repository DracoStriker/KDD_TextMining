I had seen this film some time ago, but not watched properly. It isschmaltzy, and corny, - true. It is also a beautiful, actual portrayalof love's twists, and should include a few threads that everyone canrelate to. So I am sitting here at 4am, wanting to share the momentthat I've just had with you all.One of the questions in the list was what was everyone's favourite lovestory. Mine is the one shared by Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman, - thoughof course this is not one of the nicer threads. But I have just watcheda particular scene (will not mention it in case those reading have notyet seen the film) and I am sitting here weeping... that's really oneof the finest moments I have ever witnessed on screen... and not asingle word is said.This is a stunning little film. Please take it only as it is, with thehocum, with the Christmas tint, but do take it, all together, and enjoyits various messages. Wonderful. 9/10
