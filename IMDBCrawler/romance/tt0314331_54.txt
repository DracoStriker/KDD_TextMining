Let me just start by saying that I expected alot from this movie, withactors like Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kiera Knightly, LauraLinney, Rowan Atkinson, Bill Nighy, Liam Neeson as well as the one and onlyHugh Grant you can't possibly go wrong.The movie lived up to my expectations and exceeded them immensely. Fromstart to finish this (just over two hour movie)amazing movie keeps itsaudience entertained with non stop laughs, tears and overallenjoyment.I must admit that since "I am Sam" I have never left a movie feeling ashappy as I did with Love Actually. It has a good, positive feeling about itwhich really is the centre of this masterpiece.The storylines sound confusing but really they are simple to follow andcomprehend. 8 different love stories that interwine and end on an amazingclimax on Christmas Eve. The actors, the story, the scenery, the overall spectacle of this brilliantfilm have definately added it to my top 10 list alongside The ShawshankRedemption and The Green Mile.For a feel good, funny, dramatical masterpiece I strongly recommend it toanyone and everyone.A Solid 9/10
