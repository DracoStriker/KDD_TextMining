The first time that I was forced to watch this movie, I was very tiredand fell asleep a few times. But the bits I saw were funny, so I wentout and rented it. Talk about a great romantic comedy.Cheesy? Yes, but it has to be. The entire idea of Love is cheesy tobegin with. This movie is sprinkled with cheesiness. And I loved it.As others have pointed out, it is a FANTASTIC date movie. Love,Actually not only plays to the sentimental-tacky love that women droolover, but it also plays to the more "raw" male humor. And by doing thatit leaps from you generic chick-flick to something much more clever andlovable.If you've ever fallen head over heels for someone, you will feelyourself identifying with quite a few of the stories/characters.Kudos to everybody that was involved with this movie. Truly enjoyable.
