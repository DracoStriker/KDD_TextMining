This is a wonderful movie. There's so many different stories going onand as you move between the the plots you begin to realize that thereare connections between them. It may take several viewings to get howeach plot is related to another - but there's a connection! Storiesrange from sweet to sad to young love and unrequited love. But in theend it's all about love, and shouldn't that be what the holidays areall about? One of my favorite scenes is Hugh Grant dancing around asthe Prime Minister.... but Colin firth butchering Portuguese isendearing and the guy going to America to get lucky (because with hisaccent he'll be like a prince without the whack job family) and does -is just laugh out loud funny!
