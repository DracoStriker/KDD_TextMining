I just don't understand how movies like this get made, much lesswatched by anyone, much less how I come to wind up watching it.Someone, somewhere decided it was good enough to own (I can't evenstart to fathom that) and loaned it to my wife, so we watched it.And oh my lord, how awful can you get in a two hour period??? Trite,offensive, cheeky, stupid, manipulative, unfunny....I shall not go on.But I will comment that the odd Lewinsky references were unneeded andprobably went unnoticed by most viewers. Why were they in there?Who cares?Don't see. Ever. For any reason, even if you love Emma Thompson or LiamNeeson or anyone else in it. This is a tragically horrible film.
