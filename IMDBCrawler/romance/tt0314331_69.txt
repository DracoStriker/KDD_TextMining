Something gnawed at the back of skull as I watched couple after coupleappear at the beginning of the film. Maybe it was the expectation thatAlanRickman would be drop-kicked by Bruce Willis in an unexpectedcameo...maybeit was the hope that Tony Blair would step in to rescue the poorsecretary'sreputation...and produce another dossier of Hugh's ungentlemanly conduct!The simulated sex scene was...well...for a moment I thought it was cinemaverite of a typical British tryst, but that would be unkind.No, despite the disappointment that ALL of the scenes I saw were actorsgoing through the motions, what finally caused me to flee the theater indisgust was the glimpse of...yes, you guessed it...the Love Boat along theThames! Really! Go back and take another look! Just below the giant FerrisWheel! Tell the theater owners that you'll take a free showing in exchangefor my refund.Before I got up to walk out, I became misty, remembering all the 1970sactors who had found a new life on the decks of the Pacific Princess. Theformulaic attentions of Doc, Isaac and Gopher. If `Love, Actually' hadonlybeen a musical, it would have been excellent fun.Had I known it was so horrid (7.9 rating indeed!), I would have looked foradouble-feature with Rocky Horror, and brought rice. Or, better yet, wouldhave given Love Boat alumn Ernest Borgnine a second look in "Super Fuzz"since, with his latest offering, Hugh Grant has nudged that performance upfrom the bottom of all time depths plumbed by an actor.Anchors away!1 out of 10
