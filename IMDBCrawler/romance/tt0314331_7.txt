Like most guys I would never have seen this movie on my own or with malefriends. However my girlfriend was in town and I thought a romanticcomedywould make an ideal movie for us to see together.I had heard about the reference to 9/11 made at the beginning of themovieand was dreading having to sit through that part. However I waspleasantlysurprised to note that the reference was very minor and not particularlycringe worthy either so I am not quite sure why it annoyed some people somuch.As regards to the movie overall I quite enjoyed it and would definitelyrecommend it as an ideal date film. A lot of the reviews here havedisparaged the movie because they thought it was too glib about love andvery unrealistic. But I think you have to accept that the movie was madetomake people laugh and bring the spirit of love into the Christmas holidayperiod. If you watch the film in that context then it does its jobadmirablywell.However for me the best moment in the film was the press conference given(standing side by side) by the American president and the British PrimeMinister. I actually felt like standing up and cheering when Hugh Grant(asthe Prime Minister) finally tells the American president to his face andinfront of the worlds press that Britain will no longer kowtow to Americanwishes but will have an independent view of its own.Considering that America is the biggest market for movies it wasextremelybrave of Richard Curtis to write this scene and he deserves a lot ofcreditfor portraying the American president as rather loathsome and puttingintocontext what the `Special Relationship' really is all about.As Richard Curtis must have known the movie had done okay but not greatinthe States. However it has cleaned up here in the UK and I'm sure will dovery well in the rest of the world too.So Bravo Richard Curtis for standing up for your principals; you are ahero!
