This film was horrible, and I can't believe it has got such a high rating.Igive it 0 out of 10 in an effort to bring the average down as far aspossible.If I could have, I would have left the cinema. However, I had to sitlistening to and watching the most dire set pieces and dialogue I everremember experiencing. The cringe factor was astromnomical and forced metobehave like I did back when I was a very young kid during the "scarier"bitsof Doctor Who, though in this case I din't have the comfort of a cushiontohide behind.Do yourself a favour and get it out on video as a research contribution toyour thesis on the "worst" five films ever made. This has to be up there.The added bonus of doing this is of course that you can turn the sounddown,fast forward and even switch it off after the first couple (of the dozens)of deplorable scenes.
