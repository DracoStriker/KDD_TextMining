Love was everywhere except my living room where I viewed this piece ofcrap.I haven't seen an ensemble cast movie this bad since 'America'sSweethearts' -- and this had better actors.There was no character development, no plot line other than the fact allof this junk happens around xmas. The 'jokes' are forced as are theemotions. There is no visible conclusion to the scenario with Rickman'scharacter's marriage and with all the talk about deleted scenes I hopethere was some sort of close, but I would rather have my eyeballssucked out than sit through any of the 80 minutes of director's cut. When it comes to the anti-American stuff ? who cares? We're portrayedas a country of lust filled vixens and an over sexed president, that'snot so bad, but I would hope to think someone as nasty as Billy Bobnever gets elected. For the reviewer who wrote 'For romantics only' ? get over it. If youthink this is romantic then you probably still live with your parentsand attend junior high. Yes, we go to the movies for the escape, butnot for lobotomies. As for the person who wrote the kid running throughthe airport was lucky he wasn't shot, my husband and I were rooting forthe security guards (and hoped they were packing AK47s).The people who enjoy this schmaltz and give tripe like this highratings should be drowned actually.
