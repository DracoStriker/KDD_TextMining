I was so ready to love this movie, and for much of the time I did-- it'svery well shot and pretty well paced for a storyline this complicated.Everyone is charming, London looks very pretty, I'm a big ol' softy wholoves romantic comedies.  But... but...About an hour in, it just started to get to me.  What's with all themaximum-thirty-year-old supermodels with the forty-, fifty-, heck, sixty-something guys?  What's with the bizzare beer-commercial fantasysequences?All the women are in service jobs-- secretaries, housecleaners-- and allthemen have cool boss jobs -- what's up with that?  Why do the twonormal-looking women end up being shafted, and not in a good way?  Whosefantasy is this, anyways?  It's not like I'm not aware that your avaragescreenwriter is thinking-- what if my maid was an uberbabe, and bars werefull of loose chicks in bustiers-- but it seemed to be all fantasy fortheguys and all tough truth for the girls.  Where was the hot-tub scene withEmma Thompson and three or four boytoys?  Here I am, the classicdemographicfor this picture, a thirty-something woman, and the message I'm gettingis--sorry, lady, you're too old for Alan Rickman?!?Boy, did I want to enjoy this movie, and while it was on I sort of did.Butin the end it left me kind of depressed, and I'm pretty sure that's notwhatit was aiming for.  I had to give this a five.
