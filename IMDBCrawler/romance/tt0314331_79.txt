There are some romantic comedies that could be used as a blueprint. Ormaybe some directors should just watch them, before they bring outtheir bog standard version of "man loves woman" and vice versa. Thisepisodic tale of ... well "Love actually", has great actors in it (BillNighy, Keira Nightly and so forth), that make the most of even smallstories and screen time.While this set around Christmas time, this is also a hint, that youshouldn't take the movie too seriously. The romantic factor in thestories works and every kind of love gets a stab at. It is a feel-goodmovie, a movie that speaks to the heart and actually achieves to sendthis message (again, too many shallow rom-coms, not here/this onethough!)! I'm cynical too, but sometimes it's nice to have movie, thatshows you what different meanings love can have and how love isperceived by different individuals!
