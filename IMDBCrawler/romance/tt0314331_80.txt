This movie is incredible, with a heart as big as Cinemascope. All thecharacters are constantly opening themselves up (sometimes in spite ofthemselves) to the possibilities and heartbreak of actual love. Indoing so, they also open up those around them for better and sometimesfor worse, to show compassion and passion for those around them. It isa wonderful fable, with great music, acting, comedy and pathos. Greatcameos, also, from surprising folks like Claudia Schiffer (a Christmasangel if there ever was one) and Rowan Atkinson. The last act of thismovie always leaves me a puddle on the floor, and when the Beach Boysstart singing, well, it's almost too much. This movie is more thanabout romantic love, in fact the movie itself is a tremendous gestureof generosity. The first time I watched this movie, on first release Ireally liked it, then the more I saw it the deeper it got for me. Now,one of my favorite movies, obviously.
