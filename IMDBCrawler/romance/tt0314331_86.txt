Much better movies with the multiple story structure have been made inthe recent past; Pulp Fiction and Magnolia come to mind. Love Actuallyactually owes its framework most to Mexican novellas which tellmultiple dramatic stories with one cliché after the next. The eightstories in this film are so cliché ridden it's hard not to grimace, andare only accusingly saved by a clever turn of dialogue. The shy primeminster, the lovelorn writer, the sister with the troubled brother, itall adds up to tripe. Too bad a cast and a writer who have been knownto do some good work, came together to make this. For the die-hardromantic comedy fan, Love Actually might suffice, but it's far from anaddition to the genre.
