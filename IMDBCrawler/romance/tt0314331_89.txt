Although this type of film never wins any awards, it was the best picture ofthe year 2003 for me.The casting was excellent as well as the directing. All of the actors wheresuperb, and it has a great music track.  The film dealt with the many aspects of love involving eight differentplots. There was humour, infidelity, adolescent love, passion and a wholerange of emotions dealing with love.If you are a romantic and want to see an uplifting and entertaining filmthis is it. The last scene proves that loves is all aroundus.
