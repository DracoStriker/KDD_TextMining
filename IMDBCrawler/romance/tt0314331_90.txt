Love is tender.... Love is kind.... Love is a felling that you mustfeel to express. This film manages to take several tales seldom told,and weave them into a timeless classic. The Beatles may have said "Loveis all we need", had they seen this film the title would have beenchanged to "Love Actually, is all we need" My hat comes off for theWriter, Director of this piece. This was an effort worthy of career inthe industry. A+, 5 Stars and two thumbs pointed towards the sky.I think this movie will be come a Christmas staple and every years itcomes on your will realize that more and more of these actors have goneon to critical acclaim. Get in on the ground floor of an amazing film. With love, actually, your motion picture monkey!
