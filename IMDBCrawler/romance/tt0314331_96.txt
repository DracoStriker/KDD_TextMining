After viewing this movie I wanted to push Kate Winslet off the bow ofthe Titanic just as Leo asked if she trusted him . I hoped that Elliottand the E.T. would get shot out of the sky when they did the flyingbicycle stunt . I hoped that everything that was sweet and good wouldbe replaced by evil and darkness . Love Actually was so cloyingly sweetthat I had the dry heaves for several hours afterwards . And what inthe world is Laura Linney and Liam Neeson doing in this picture ?Didn't Liam Neeson read the script before he agreed to play the fatherto the most annoying child of all time ? There's always a tendency tomake children play older than their biological age . See Jerry Maguire, Sleepless in Seattle and Field of Dreams . But does the kid have tobe so much smarter than the parent ? Cute kids really put me off . Andof course the Director ties everything up in a pretty pink bow in thelast ten minutes . All the male characters come to their respectivesenses and rush to the airport to profess their love for the girl thatthey'd been staring dreamily into space for . God , that hurts . Can'tColin Firth and Hugh Grant ever get killed or maybe get AIDS or get runover by one of those double - decker buses . Oh please God , let memake a movie . I promise you it won't have a happy ending .
