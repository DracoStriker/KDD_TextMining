Oh dear. This is a horrible film. It follows a number of couplesthrough their struggles with love. Cue cliché after cliché of Englishromantic views of love that are about 30 years out of date. I thoughthorrible sentimental crud like this went out of fashion in the 80's.The only thing to make it worse would be having Bon Jovi on thesoundtrack! The dialogue seems to be written by College students. Onthe plus side, the performances are good - the actors should have beengiven more to work with than a few minutes each at a time which wasdisappointing. Hugh Grant plays the one role he can do well the same ashe did in all his other films. The story lines are just embarrassingand not heartwarming at all unless you're an old widow. The story aboutBill Nighy seemingly leaving his mate out is the worst but the one withMartin Freeman is one of the worst ideas I have ever come across. Itsnot funny and even that gets stretched over the course of the film. TheEmma Thompson/Alan Rickman one is the only interesting one but thatfollows a tired old formula too, as if the writer has no personalexperience of love - just what he/she has read/seen. This film, isaimed at weeping housewives with nothing better to do than curl up onthe sofa with a box of choccies. Best leave them to it.
