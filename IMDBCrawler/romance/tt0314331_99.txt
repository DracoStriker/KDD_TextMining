I'm 84 years old and have seen an awful lot of movies. "Best" like"Beauty" is in the eye of the beholder. If by law, I was only allowedto own one DVD...it would be "Love Actually". I fell in love with everymember of the cast-man, woman and child and I find it the mostentertaining movie I have ever seen. Each story is perfect and thecasting,from the smallest part to the major roles was perfect. I boughtthe DVD based on the cast. Some of my favorite people were in it. I hadnever heard of the picture before, but with names like Emma Thompson,Colin Firth, etc. I decided to take a chance. I have the DVD,the CD andthe Book. Thanks and congratulations Mr. Curtis! Oh yeah...Cut down onthose bacon sandwiches. :}
