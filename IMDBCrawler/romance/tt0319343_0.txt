This was one of my favorite movies in 2003. Will Ferrell is brilliantas the Elf. The supporting cast is great too, especially Bob Newhart ashis elf "dad". The characters are well written and it is a refreshingfilm to get lost in. Will Ferrell plays the elf with such innocence, heis so funny! This is not just a Christmas film but when the DVD comesout I will be watching "Elf" in July. The story progresses nicely,there are many lessons to be learned as you watch this movie. Ittouched my heart in many ways. I highly recommend this movie for kidsAND adults, you won't regret it. Treat yourself and watch this"original" movie. Hollywood needs to make more like this.
