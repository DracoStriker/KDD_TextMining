It was so nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie featuring anSNL actor without having to mute or fast forward any crude parts.Granted, this may not be Will Farrell's most amazing performance, butif you want a new Christmas movie to watch this season, I highlyrecommend Elf. I talked to a few people who thought the movie wasstupid, but that was because they were expecting Will Farrell'scharacter to be a duplicate of his SNL performances. So, to fully enjoythis movie, watch it without any expectations and remember that it'sokay to have a childlike sense of humor--nobody's too cool for a greatChristmas movie. I love most all the movies from Adam Sandler, RobSchneider, Will Farrell, Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, andDavid Spade, but most of them aren't appropriate for viewers of allages. Elf is a movie you can throw in the VCR and not have to worryabout what the kids hear or see on it. Thanks, Will, for putting out ahilarious movie that the whole family can watch!
