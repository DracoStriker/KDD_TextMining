This was my 4th viewing and now ready to review.The story is insane. This film should not have worked. But almost as atribute to the X-Mas miracles it tries to riff off, it is anastonishingly entertaining film.Behind the camera Favreau, Mr Money Shot, who has quietly withoutfanfare turned into one of the hottest directors in Hollywood history.In front of the camera Farell who I usually don't care for but may justgive the performance of his career here. A script to die for. Probablythe best use of Zoey D's looks in her career to date.Way under rated and unappreciated.As in my other reviews, most "recent" X-Mas films (since about 2000)are Canadian B-movies shot on a budget which would barely cover a renoon THIS OLD HOUSE What an unexpected treat See it
