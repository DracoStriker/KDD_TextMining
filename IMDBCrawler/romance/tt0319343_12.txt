BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIRNAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVEDWITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGEAGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVENO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THEM. I saw "Elf" when it was first released theatrically in 2003. I did notsee it again until 2016. I forgot everything about this film. What Ican't believe was that I forgot how wonderful this film was. It doeseverything you want in a "Christmas" movie. This film is full of"Christmas Spirit" that most films never seem to capture. In this film On Christmas Eve in 1973, an orphaned infant boy stowsaway on Santa Claus' sack. When discovered back at the North Pole, heis adopted by Papa Elf. Papa Elf names his son Buddy.Buddy grows up at the North Pole believing he is an elf, but due to hishuman size is unable to perform elf tasks. When Buddy accidentallylearns that he is human, Papa Elf explains that he was born to WalterHobbs and Susan Wells, and was given up for adoption without Walterknowing. Susan died and Walter works at a book publisher in New YorkCity. Buddy travels to find him, whom Santa indicates that Walter is onthe naughty list due to his greed and selfishness. Buddy then is out tosave Walter and Christmas itself. This should be on your must see watch list.
