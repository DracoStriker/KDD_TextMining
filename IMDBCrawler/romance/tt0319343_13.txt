I feel torn. On one hand, this was an extremely well-done movie. Veryentertaining. Funny. Cute. Captured all of the elements one mightrequire in a Christmas movie. On the other hand, I felt it was a little too cloying and saccharine.There were some very entertaining moments and good scenes, but it'sobvious this movie was made for the whole family (which is fine) and,in the end, it didn't feel like a great movie. It felt like a goodmovie. You have to be ready to stomach the shmaltz, mind you (and thereis a lot). I'm torn between rating it 6 or 7. Why? Because on one hand, theshmaltzy elements alienated me a bit from the film but on the otherhand, the movie has heart and is essentially a feel-good Christmasmovie with all the fixins. And, I don't want to come across like aScrooge. It was well-filmed. Zooey looked beautiful. It was funny in a broadsort of way. James Caan isn't as badass or mean as you originallythink, and in the end, he seems rather likable. My complaint is that the movie could have more edge. Maybe it's becauseI spent the last few days watching really good thrillers, but I feltlike this movie could have had a darker dark side. For me, it wouldhave enriched the experience. As it stands now, it's sweet, fun, harmless and stands alone as arather storybook Christmas fairytale that can appeal to a hugedemographic. But heed this warning: There are a large share ofChristmas songs, and several shmaltzy moments. Add this to your Christmas movie list. It's worth it. It ain't thebest, but it's a well put together little tale with enough funnymoments to make the experience worthwhile. And a heckuva lot of Christmas spirit. Cheesy and cloying at times, butstill... it's there. Enjoy it.
