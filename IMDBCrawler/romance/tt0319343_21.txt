This film has a very good cast with some big names of the time and pastin entertainment. "Elf" is a modern Christmas fairy tale that scoreswell just for its comedy. Somewhere amid the crazy antics andsituations there is a Christmas message or two. But this film issomething to enjoy just for the laughs. Most of the humor comes from anovergrown elf trying to adapt and learn how to live in an adult world.Along the way, he spreads some Christmas joy. Will Ferrell is Buddy ? an overgrown elf by mistake, whose doingsresemble the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and Merwin's magic. It'shard to imagine anyone else giving the performance Ferrell gives here.The role seems written for him. Bob Newhart is Papa Elf. I don't knowany other comedian who could get people to laugh so much with astraight face. He applies his trademark as well in "Elf." Edward Asneris Santa Claus, and James Caan is Buddy's real father, Walter. A hostof younger actors do very well in their supporting roles. This is a fun movie that most should enjoy for the silliness andlaughter.
