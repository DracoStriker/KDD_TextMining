A great excuse for Will Ferrell to run around in holiday garb, drawingsidelong glances from the sidewalk-strollers of Manhattan. Ferrell isthe ultimate man-child, a six-and-a-half foot mess of arms and legs ingreen tights, buckled shoes and a pointy hat, matching the elvishwardrobe of 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. As physical comedyand ridiculous enthusiasm is his forte, Elf makes for an excellentvehicle, but it's also loaded with a swath of supporting talent(admittedly, another of the comedian's calling cards). Zooey Deschanel(somewhat unrecognizable in blonde hair) is a good fit as hisskeptical, frayed love interest, but the best work comes from JamesCaan, Peter Dinklage, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass andespecially Bob Newhart as his sweet, yet long-suffering, adoptivefather on the North Pole. Genuinely funny, warm, sugary and spirited;an unexpectedly effective successor to the Christmas classics itseemingly sets out to roast. Worth adding to the annual rotation.
