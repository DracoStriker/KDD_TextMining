Wow. Will doesn't have to be crude, addicted to sports or streakingnaked to entertain the masses.What a lovely and non-threatening holiday classic. Pretty darn funny insome spots, warm in others and the suspension of disbelief is fairlyeasy for the most part. (I mean, except?He's still human, right?Wouldn't he freeze in that outfit? I digress?)I've only seen this once before ? many years ago and remember likingit, but since I've heard so many people call it their favorite, I hadto revisit this Christmas Eve 2015. Not sorry I did and will nowcontinue to cherish it many more times. Kinda reminded me a ton of another one of my all-time favoritecomedies, Liar Liar, this movie about an adopted kid/elf seeking outhis stereotypical bad movie dad and showing true positivity in anotherwise cross New York City is perfect for the whole family. Andevery once in a while, it's nice to have something that's both greatfor kids, but also enjoyable to adults?without being a Pixar animatedmovie. ***Final thoughts: You may have been right about the half star, Chris, butforgot about the four full ones before it. See? My heart's not alwaysthree sizes too small! (Oops, wrong movie?)
