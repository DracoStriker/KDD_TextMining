How this movie is "only" rated 6.9 is a mystery to me. Everybody I knowyoung and old, who has ever seen it fell in love with it. For mepersonally, Elf is up there with Miracle on 34th Street and It's AWonderful Life- not just a great Christmas movie but one of the eatfamily movies you'll ever see. Will Ferrell is hot and cold when itcomes to his film work. I've enjoyed maybe half of his movies, but theother half are unfunny duds. (Bewitched, Kicking and Screaming, andSemi-Pro come to mind.). Elf is probably his very best work ever- andalso just happens to be his most innocent, childlike character. Thesupporting cast is wonderful, too. James Caan is a great, grumpy comicfoil, and Bob Newhart is perfect, as always.
