Elf seems to have become a Christmas Classic over the years. The kindof film kids want to see each December along with Home Alone.The premise is rather silly. Will Ferrell is an infant adopted in theNorth Pole and wrongly thinks he is an elf despite being much tallerthan the other elves.The naive Ferrell decides to go to New York in search of his realfather once he finds out the truth. Dad happens to be the more cynicalJames Caan who is rather taken aback by a long lost son who thinks heis an elf and maybe borderline retarded.Ferrell gets a job helping out at Santa's grotto in a department storewhilst trying to connect with his father and help the real Santa bygetting the public some real Christmas spirit to make his sleigh soar.The film is both silly and charming. Kids will love it but adults mayfind it a little bit over the top. Ferrell has enough charm to pull offthe role. James Caan on the other hand has found a new generation offans who know him as Walter and not Sonny Corleone.
