I saw it last night at a Christmas party and found it enjoyable. Butdespite its Christmas theme, it was really intended to entertain adultsrather than children.There was no profanity, graphic violence, and sexuality was limited toseeing the head and shoulders of a woman in the shower. But much of thehumor would fly against most children's' heads. The basic story isabout a human baby in an orphanage who crawled into Santa Claus's toysack and ends up at the North Pole, being raised by an elf there.Buddy, as he is named, does not fit in as he is a giant compared to theelves, and Santa allows him to go to New York City to meet hisbiological father-who happens to be on Santa's naughty list for beingtoo devoted to his career to pay attention to his family. Buddy meetshis father, who disbelieves him at first, and he goes to the Gimbel'sdepartment store where he is mistaken as an employee and is put towork. Buddy inadvertently causes trouble there, and when he reuniteswith his father who finally discovers that Buddy was the son he neverknew existed, he inadvertently brings trouble to his new family too.The movie is based on the "fish out of water" trope, and Buddy is naivebut not necessarily stupid. The ending is happy if predictable, and itworks as adult Christmas entertainment. The actors work well in theirrespective parts too and Ed Asner makes a surprisingly effective Santa.Recommended, but really for the grown-ups.
