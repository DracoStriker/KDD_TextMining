Elf, a movie directed by Jon Favreau features Buddy The Elf (WillFerrel) as a human who was adopted by Santa Clause and his Elves atbirth. His massive size has always hindered his elf-like talents but heis accepted by them none the less. When Buddy learns of his biologicalfather (James Caan) being on the Naughty List, he is sent to New Yorkcity on his quest to regain his father's compassion. The film plot andstoryline are somewhat predictable, but in an endearing way. Ferrelldoes a great job of really taking on a character with a ton ofdifferent quirks that a lot of actors would not take on as well as hedid. His love interest in the movie, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) issomewhat of a weak point acting-wise in the cinematic adventure. Hermonotone voice does little for the vibrant aura of the surroundingactors and she has little to no relevance to the plot or events thattake place during Buddy's antics. Overall, the movie is a great familyfilm but also is a movie that is great for all ages. It has elementsthat appeal to a large variety of demographics and is slowly becoming aholiday classic that can be viewed on television multiple times duringthe season. OVERALL RATING: 8.5/10
