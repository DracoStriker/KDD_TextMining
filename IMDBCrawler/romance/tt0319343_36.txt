Anybody who knows me knows I'm hard on Will Ferrell. However, afterseeing this movie I have Ferrell fever! Ferrell proved himself worthyof the comedic giant status he has earned by portraying the naiveover-sized "Elf (human)" named Buddy, a human adopted by an elf who israised in the North Pole and somewhat reeks havoc on the elf communitywith just his sheer size. After having a talk with his father, heembarks on the mission of a lifetime to find out who Buddy the Elftruly is! Being fueled with nothing but sugar and a pure adrenalinerush, Buddy ends up lost in the big apple, unintentionally reekinghavoc along the way, finding someone who graciously opens his home toBuddy only to have the door slammed right in his sweet little elf faceafter good intentions turn into bad reality. Along the adventure heproves to every stuffed shirt stuck up businessman the true Christmasspirit lies within your heart, and Santa Clause really does exist andis fueled by the pure joy of Christmas. This movie has become a staplein our yearly Christmas line up. Kudos to Ferrell for making a familyfriendly comedy unlike some of the other great actors that have comefrom SNL.
