Elf is one of the all-time classic Christmas movies. Quite possibly thefunniest Christmas movie of all-time, and you will see Elf Marathons onTV for the next 50 years. This will become our generations "A ChristmasStory", even though "A Christmas Story" wasn't popular at the time ofrelease, and didn't even really get a cult following until a decadelater. Elf has been, and will always be a classic film. I can'tunderstand the 6.8 overall rating here on IMDb. I was expecting upwardsof an 8+ overall.Will Ferrell is a character actor who did an absolutely brilliantportrayal of Buddy the Elf, a human that was raised in an Elf Village.His naivety in regards to how the real world works is absolutelyhilarious and ridiculous, but believable, because Ferrell did such anamazing job.
