Will Ferrell does a great job here, and it's the perfect Christmas(Holiday) movie that can be enjoyed anytime of the year.The contrast of almost unbalanced folly of Will's character with thosethat encompass him, lends a great degree of innocence and non-stop joyand plenty of laughter as he leaves the mundane world of the usual,boring, and often time intolerance of the world in his dust.It's refreshing to see a story where others are encouraged to rise tothe level of this main character instead of him being overwhelmed anddragged down by the majority of "Cotten Headed Ninny Muggins", a.k.a.the "touch me not, speak to me not" big city public psyche so familiarthat many walk around with.For those that represent the general public in the movie, as well asthe audience, Ferrell's character dares us to believe again, even for amoment of the magic of Christmas and tears down decades of politicalcorrectness to connect us with the late 60s and 70s when so many annualHoliday shows brought us a seemingly sustained desire to entertainourselves with the magic that waxes then wanes but for a few shortweeks each year. Whether a work of animation or raw theater, thisrefreshing story brings vitality and rekindles childhood memories forthe kid in all of us.
