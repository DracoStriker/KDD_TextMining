I am an ESL teacher, and at this time of year, I would really love toshow the movie elf to my students, WITH SUBTITLES!!! My husband and Iown many DVDs, including a deluxe copy of elf. Every other DVD that weown has subtitles in English, and many have subtitles in otherlanguages as well. For some unknown reason, despite the fact that ourdeluxe edition of elf includes soundtracks in both English and Spanishon both the Widescreen and the Fullscreen DVDs, I cannot find ANYsubtitles! I have played both discs on our DVD players and on myMacBookPro, and am not able to find ANY subtitles!Why, on earth, would a movie company produce a DVD withoutsubtitles????????? My students are not fluent speakers of English, andit is very helpful for them to be able to view movies with subtitles!!Do you have any suggestions????
