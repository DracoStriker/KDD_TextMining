Will Farrell has done better films than this one but this is a warmfeel good holiday film. When you look at it as a whole film, it holds acertain charm. That charm is established by framing the story aroundbelief in the fantasy known as Christmas.This is the most extensive work done by Bob Newhart since the 1990's.Bob is the framework that holds this story together. Ed Asner has avery small role as Santa & is just here enough to be recognizablehaving little chance to do much acting.Brunette bomb shell Zooey Deschannel is charming as a blonde & provesshe can sing. Hopefully she will get some better roles as her youngcareer has proved she can handle them. In this movie, she makes theviewer buy that young innocent charm as she glows here.Faizon Love is excellent in support as the Gimbles store manager. JamesCaan is OK here, less annoying than in some films, but for some reasonhe does not seem to get really good roles anymore.There are some gross holiday bits, like downing a 2 liter Coke & a 5minute belch which is entirely logical, and then some bits which arefunny physical comedy. Farrell does not carry the whole show here andthat is a good thing. While he is considered the star of his films, hisfilms are better when the support can carry them. His easily worst filmis Bewitched where he tried to carry the entire film & flopped badly.This doesn't measure up to classic holiday films but is better thansome of the lame efforts of recent years.
