You may expect this film to be a little on the kiddie side, but in factit it is a great family comedy with jokes for all ages. The story istold by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who tells the story of his son.Basically Santa (Edward Asner) was delivering at an orphanage, and ababy managed to get out his crib and crawl into Santa's sack (to get atoy), and he was brought to the North Pole. Papa raised this boy, henamed Buddy, as his own, and as he grew he learnt the elf world as ifhe was one. But it is after he overhears that he is human that Buddy(Will Ferrell) decides he should find his real family. Papa gives him aphoto he has kept of his birth father, Walter (James Caan), who dealswith book publishing, and is unfortunately on the naughty list. SoBuddy sets off to New York, and with his childlike innocence discoversall the wonders of the city. When he does meet Walter, he does notbelieve he is his son, or in Santa, so till he can get to him again,Buddy stays in the near toy store, where he meets his beautiful loveinterest, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). The second time he meets his Dad,Buddy is confirmed from DNA results of his biology, and Walter doeseventually let him come home with him to meet wife Emily (Back to theFuture Part III's Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael (Daniel Tay).Walter does try to make Buddy more normal by taking him to work, andgiving him normal clothes, but his childish behaviour still causeschaos, especially when the employees are talking to short children'sbook writer Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage), who Buddy keeps calling Elf.Walter loses his patience and sends Buddy away, but when Santa crashesin the middle of central park because he has run low on Christmasspirit to power the sleigh, everyone shows they believe by singingalong with Jovie to help, even Scrooge-like Walter. The highlights forme are all of Ferrell, but more especially the snowball fight and thelarge burp after drinking a whole bottle of Coca Cola in seconds. Good!
