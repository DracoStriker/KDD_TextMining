I'll start by saying I can't personally stand Will Ferrel and usuallydon't like his movies. I don't find him funny and I don't normally findany humour or anything to laugh at in his films.This is a rare exception. It's a Christmas movie and I'm reviewing ithaving seen it on TV at the weekend.This movie is in the same kind of genre as Dudley Moore's "The SantaClause Movie" and Tim Allen's "The Santa Clause". Ferrel plays Buddy, ababy who crawls into Santa's sack one year when he's delivering giftsto an orphanage. Sadly the film derails itself right there as a babymanages to open a locked cot and fall safely from 2 feet up withoutmaking a sound.Ignoring that (and we must, unfortunately) the baby is only discoveredwhen Santa returns to the North Pole workshop and is adopted and raisedas an Elf. Eventually he discovers he is human and sets off to discoverhis real father (James Caan, not suited to comedy or kids films whichthis is really).The film follows Buddy as he tries to fit into Human culture and howbadly he is suited to that task having been raised in the Elf culture.The film is decent enough and is greatly improved by Buddy's loveinterest Zooey Deschanel (who I only knew from the Hitch Hikers Moveand had the feeling that Reese Witherspoon turned this role down).She looks great and plays her role well enough. James Caan has somegood moments but really isn't suited to this type of movie.The locations and sets are very good, there's a small appearance fromKG (of Tenacious D fame) as a creative writer and the role of Caan'swife (Mary Steenburgen) could have been cast a lot better as she reallyisn't suited to this type of film either so both her and James Caanwere very badly miscast.The film is mildly bearable with the brain disengaged, even Ferrelmanages to not annoy for a change.OK for kids.
