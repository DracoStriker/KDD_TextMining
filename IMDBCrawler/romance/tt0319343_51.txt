This film was hilarious for children or adult. Will Ferrel acted sowell and made laugh very hard. The plot wasn't so excellent, it's aneasy quest for the story. Actually, i only see Ferrel in maybe 3 or 4movies, most of them in minor roles, and this was his best appearancethat i ever known.I bet Favreau directed well for this movie. Two thumbs up for his firstbig project movie. maybe there's one thing to criticize that the love between Buddy andhis father it was showed too cliché and it was too easy to solve it.Wish more complicated for this scene. but, this was a great movie ofthe year.
