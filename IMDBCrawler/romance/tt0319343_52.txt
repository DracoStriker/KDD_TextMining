This movie had all of the usual formulas of a Christmas movie; all theredeeming qualities. However, unless you have to take the kids to see amovie, don't see this. It isn't worth it. The movie is well casted, however, and Will Ferrel made it. He was the onlyreason why I liked it at all: "You're sitting on a throne of lies!" AndJames Caan is always a great choice, but being that it is a typicalChristmas movie, if you want to get into the holiday cheer, see somethingworth while. And one more question. Why, oh, why did Jon Favreau direct this. He has somuch more talent than to go this far and direct a holiday kids movie. Jon,why?5/10
