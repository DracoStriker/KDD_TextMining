This is a truly funny tribute to MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and RUDOLPH THERED-NOSED REINDEER. The references to RUDOLPH are very clear, but if youhaven't seen that one, you'll still find this a funny movie. If yourememberthe seventies, you'll feel a certain nostalgia, what with the presence ofEd Asner, Bob Newhart and, as the voice of a Burl Ives snowmancounterpart,Leon Redbone. (The snowman even looks like Leon Redbone, just as RUDOLPH'ssnowman resembles Burl Ives.)James Caan shows an ability with pathos and Will Ferrell has a silentmoviecomedian's ability to appear simultaneously naive and knowing.I also like the fact that the department store in this is the now-defunctGimbel's. I understand this was the case because Macy's wanted scriptchanges.It works as a New York movie, too.Check it out.
