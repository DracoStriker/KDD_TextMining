It's Christmas time and being a massive movie fan I decided it would beappropriate to watch some Christmas movies. I hadn't seen Elf so Ithought I'd give it a go.So Will Ferrell plays a human who was brought up by elves and decidesto go and find his real family.Now there are a few Christmas movies which I enjoy but unfortunatelythis isn't one of them. I found it minimally funny. In fact the humourwas a bit too childish for my own liking.I was never really a fan of Will Ferrell. I found him a bit silly and Idon't think he fitted the role. I think his role would have been bettersuited to someone younger.Please forgive me for being like Scrooge but I did not enjoy thismovie. If you want a good family Christmas movie, watch Home Aloneinstead.
