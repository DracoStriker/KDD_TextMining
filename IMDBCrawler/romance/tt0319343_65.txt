I have to say that I hadn't seen this movie when it first came out andmy friend has seem it thousands of times and always said how good itwas.Well, I haven't really been in the Christmas spirit at all this yearand I watched this with my high schoolers that I teach and I have tosay that I am now in the holiday spirit! For anyone down or depressed,watch this movie! This just makes me feel good and I couldn't care lesshow far-fetched it might be! People take things too seriously and thereis enough suffering out there, so we should just take this film at facevalue and let it make us laugh, though the sheer silliness of it! WillFerrell definitely can put a smile on my face!
