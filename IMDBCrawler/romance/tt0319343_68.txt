I watched this last night as it was on TV and there was nothing on atall last night so I said since we are reaching the holidays I might aswell watch it. The movie is similar to Enchanted in a way(minus theanimation)and it tells the story of a man who is raised by Santa'self's and he goes to NYC to find his biological father who is a writerapparently . Buddy(Ferrell) then meets a girl named Jovie(ZooeyDeshnail who is a dead ringer to Katy Perry)and becomes smitten withher.I may not be a fan of Will Ferrell but I laughed at a few parts to thismovie like the part where he is singing the Baby its cold outside songfrom Tom Jones and the part where he humiliates his father at work bysome guy who he called an elf too LOL that was hilarious.The movie is a bit stupid but I like fish out of water movies as I likehow the characters interact with our world and that. I liked some partsto it but the ending was quite dumb. So I am giving it a 6 simplybecause its nearly Xmas and I like to get into the Holiday season.
