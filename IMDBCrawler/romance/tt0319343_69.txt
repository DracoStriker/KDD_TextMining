Elf is supposed to be a comedy, but it's more along the lines oftravesty. We're supposed to laugh every time Will Ferrel's characterBuddy does something boneheaded, but I found myself cringing andmoaning almost every time he showed up on screen. Relentless stupidityand disgusting sight gags are supposed to pass for humour here, and itseems to be the only trick Elf has up its sleeve. For example, in onescene Buddy chugs a bottle of Coke down and starts to burp continuouslyfor 12 seconds. In another, he licks bird excrement off of a rail. Ugh.This buffoonery continues for 97 minutes, and it never gets any lesspainful. I could comment on the acting, but I don't know what to say.The actors all do a perfect job of being unbearable. The camera-workand sound are both fine as well. In fact, the cinematography is thehigh point of the film. However, when the best thing about a movie isthe camera angle, you know it stinks. Little kids will love it, though.
