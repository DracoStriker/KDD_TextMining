ELF (2003) *** 1/2 Will Ferrell, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, EdwardAsner, Bob Newhart, Zooey Daschanel, Daniel Tay, Amy Sedaris, FaizonLove, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass, Michael Lerner, Artie Lange, PeterBillingsley, Peter Dinklage, Claire Lautier, Jon Favreau. Ferrell givesan inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The NorthPole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his questto be re-united with his long-lost father (Caan in an inspired bit ofcasting), a 'naughty-list' occupant, who works as a children's bookpublisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Hystericallyfunny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (noone else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yetretaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblanceto Tom Hanks' turn in 'BIG') with a great cast especially thebeguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper atGimbels'who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmthby Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaumwith a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nodto classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instantholiday classic. Trivia note: Billingsley, best known as Ralphie fromthe yuletide cinematic classic, plays 'A CHRISTMAS STORY' the elfforeman!
