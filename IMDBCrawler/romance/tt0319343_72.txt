I didn't laugh one time. Not once. I thought Will Ferrel was kind offunny on SNL But he isn't funny in movies. I wasn't surprised Ed Asnerwould be in something of such low quality but I was kind of surprisedJames Caan would. Caan should know better. It tries to be funny butfalls flat. It tries to be heart warming but the try is faint andfails. The love element is all but embarrassing for the lady in themovie and unbelievable for the audience. Movies like this aren'tsupposed to great art but they are supposed to be entertaining on atleast a child like level but Elf just can't even manage that. Don'twaste the time with this dud.
