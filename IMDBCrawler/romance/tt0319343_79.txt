I could not believe this movie at all. So many of the comments areabout what a wonderful movie this is, and I watched this with mychildren in great anticipation, but I kept wondering, would anyone wantto watch this more than once? I like sappy Christmas movies; they arefun. I even like fantasies based on a silly premise. To work, however,there must be some semblance of believability.The Elf character was so much over the top, that even as a non-human ina human body, he didn't quite fit reality. From the premise in themovie, elves are hard-working, optimistic, and encouraging, but theyare not stupid. It was the other characters, though, that really stoodout. When Buddy was doing his silly stuff, the other characters juststood there as if they were waiting for him to finish his lines,instead of reacting as you would expect New Yorkers to react to a wackolike that.James Caan was believable, but no one else was. That has to be laid atthe feet of the writer and/or director.My opinion is clearly in the minority, but I thought this was one ofthe worst movies I've seen in a very long time.
