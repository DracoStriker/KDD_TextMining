This movie has changed my life in the most awesomest of ways. It hasshown me that tall people are not a threat to the environment andcannot unintentionally harm anyone. Speaking from a hooman bean who is5"2, tall peeps can sometimes appear spooky but this movie hasexpressed to me in the most delightful of ways that when it isChristmas, everyone is welcome. And pancakes with everything on themare amazing. That is all. Goodnight, farewell. :)
