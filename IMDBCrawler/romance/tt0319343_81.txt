the fact that Will Farrell's character is told at the North Pole thatwhen he goes to civilization, if he sees gum on the ground or anywhere,don't eat it because it's not free candy; it's dirty. And theneverybody cracks up, going "Eeewww!" when he picks all the gum wads offthe subway railing and eats them. Wasn't he just told minutes ago tonot do that?
