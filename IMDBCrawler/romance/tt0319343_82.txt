Like most people around the holidays, I'm usually up for a watching (orre-watching) of the great holiday classics ("Wonderful Life", "HomeAlone", etc.). For whatever reason, however, it took me until 2016 toactually sit down and watch "Elf" all the way through. While maybe notjumping up to the top of my "all-time Christmas list", I did find Elfto be an enjoyable romp.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Buddy(Ferrell), a human boy raised in the North Pole due to a mix-up withSanta Claus (Ed Asner). For most of his life, Buddy believes he is anactual elf, until realizing his shortcomings in that community. Assuch, he decides to strike out for the "human world" in order to findhis real father (James Caan). Along the way, Buddy (as a result of hisendearing cheerfulness) brings a bit of Christmas spirit to all thosearound him that are in dire need of it, including a young retail workernamed Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).To me, "Elf" is primarily a success because of the iconic characterthat Ferrell creates. The script/plot itself is about as irrelevant andcorny as they come, but Ferrell's quirky energy steals every singlescene. Quotes like "You sit on a throne of lies", "Bye buddy, hope youfind your Dad!", and "Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?" willforever be burned into my memory! I don't think there is an actor outthere who could have played Buddy as perfectly as Ferrell.Simply put, I'm glad I finally sat down and watched "Elf" frombeginning to end. I don't know if it will get watched religiously everyChristmas in my home (time will tell on that one...but maybe it willgrow on me even more!), but I can tell you that I will be quoting itgoing forward!
