This is on my all time favourite list. I love that movie. Buddy is anelf and he is looking for his father. He was always a bit different. Hewas raised by elves an a human. As soon as he finds his father, hewants to gain his love and affection. He does hilarious things toachieve that.Buddy is clumsy and very charming in its own special way and you can 'tavoid to like him. The story is quite simple but I never get bored to watch that movie. Ihave been doing this every year since I was a teenager. No Christmaswithout Buddy the elf. It is something you can watch with the family or on your own. The film covers romance in a charming way without overdoing it orgetting cheesy. It is very funny without forcing it too much. I am nota big fan of Romance or Comedy but this lovely movie gem has all goingfor it. You get the Christmas spirit and what's really important packedin a wonderful and entertaining film. I strongly recommend to watch it. Hopefully you will love it as much asI do.
