I can relate it when someone doesn't rely on a macho attitude.. It'show I want to be too.. I can't be serious.. I must be crazy.. Or else Ipanic.. Instead of healthy socializing.. I choose crazy.. Crazy isalways the right way.. I never get too close to people.. Because whenyou get too close.. They start influencing you right or wrong.. I hatethe idea I have no control over myself.. I must always be in control ofmy own actions and thoughts.. Therefor, I choose crazy over social.. Ifthat means doing my own thing whether it's walking around in an elfsuit, but with a healthy clean conscious, so it be.. If a woman doesn'twant me because I'm not macho enough, then I guess I've outgrown them..And macho is not what I'm in for.. Too bad.. If that even means stayingalone, I will.. Because there's no greater joy than that of a peacefulmind..
