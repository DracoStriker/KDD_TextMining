Buddy is a human who has been raised as one of Santa's elves. One dayBuddy sets off to New York to find his birth father, Walter Hobbs. NewYork is a whole new experience for Buddy...Reasonably entertaining Christmas movie. Plot is mostly unoriginal,predictable and trite. However, doesn't take itself too seriously.Moves along briskly and is quite funny at times. Kids will love it, butadults might find it so-so.Will Ferrell is good in the lead role - was a perfect casting for therole. Good support from James Caan, Edward Asner, Mary Steenburgen andthe gorgeous Zooey Deschanel.
