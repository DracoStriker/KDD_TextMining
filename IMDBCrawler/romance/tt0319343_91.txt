Probably the greatest Christmas movie of all time, Jon Favreau's Elf ismade wonderful by Will Ferrell's disarmingly innocent performance asBuddy. Many of the best scenes are Ferrell in character walking aroundNew York and interacting with people, places and things. A sweetscreenplay and magical direction from Favreau also boost thisbeautifully novel idea.Ferrell's deliriously happy Buddy is the film's heart and soul, butthere's much to be said for James Caan's flawlessly cast Walter Hobbs,Buddy's biological father. Grumpy and irritated in thatquintessentially "dad" kind of mood, Caan owns the role and performseven better in the film's final warm scenes. Zooey Deschanal is cutebut her romance with Buddy is carried by the writing and Ferrell'scommitted fervor, as Deschanal drones the film's lines with dead eyesand little energy. Faizon Love as the manager of a toy store that Buddyaccidentally works at for a day is a scene stealer.Elf is sweet and cheesy in that ideal Christmas film way. Its anessential for the holidays alongside Love, Actually and probablyFerrell's most delightful work to date.
