The first time my kids watched this was in summer with their cousins.We were on our way to a vacation and they four of them were cracking upin the back seat.First thing to point out - the kids ranged in age from 6 to 11. Secondis that it was summer and close to 10 years since this movie came out.And all the kids loved it.So do we! We quote it between us often, especially the classic scenewith Peter Dinklage. That entire scene is worth the entire movie. Don'tlet the negative reviews turn you off. If your kids appreciate goodhumor and pratfalls, they'll get it."Dad! There's an evil hissing box in the window!" I'm laughing justthinking about my son quoting it.
