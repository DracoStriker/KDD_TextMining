While at the North Pole, the first half of the film is almost magical,with homage to the Rankin-Bass animations and other Christmas classics.The good supporting cast, including Zooey Deschanel, does a fine job.However, James Caan (as Elf's real father) is a "cooler" and sucks allthe life out of the story, along with the dreadful office scenes. (Ifound the mail-room and "midget" book-author sub-plots to be stupid.)Like "Santa Claus" it's very uneven, and only comes back-to-life at thevery end. Both Bob Newhart and Ed Asner are fine as "Papa Elf" and"Santa". Will Ferrell is surprisingly good as a 6 ft. tall "Elf". ButNYC is not at all magical here, except for Rockefeller Plaza. Pleasenote that Gimbels Dept. Store went out of business about 16 yearsbefore this movie was made. "Zooey" is adorable as "Mrs. Elf" at themovie's end.
