A festive favourite.Every year as Christmas approaches I look forward to watching my usualChristmas movies. Elf is always one that I watch, every single yearwithout fail, it is everything a Christmas film should be and muchmore! Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls in to Santa's sack when a baby oneChristmas Eve & is accidentally taken back to the North Pole. Santa andhis Elves realise that he must have crawled in as Santa visited anorphanage & as he has no parents, one of the elves steps forward andraises him. The story then fast forwards 20 years or so and Buddyleaves the North Pole and travels to New York to find his real Dad (whohappens to be on the naughty list!!).Will Ferrell does an incredibly good job at playing his part and thesupporting cast are equally as good. There are no rude or edgy bits(which is unusual for a Will Ferrell movie) and it is very much afamily film, suitable for all ages! Elf is a real festive, feel good, classic Christmas film with a greatcast, fantastic story and many hilarious moments.9/10
