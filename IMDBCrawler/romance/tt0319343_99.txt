"Elf" is a Christmas-themed comedy starring Will Ferrell. Ferrell playsBuddy, a human who, as a baby, accidentally crawled into Santa Claus'(Ed Asner) toy sack and upon discovery is adopted by an elf (BobNewhart, playing a version of his harried TV personas).One fateful day, Buddy is told the truth of his parentage, and decidesto travel to New York City to find his real father. While Buddy'sbiological mom is deceased, it turns out Buddy's biological father isWalter, a high-ranking editor at a book publishing firm. Walter hassince married and has a preteen son. He's totally incredulous andannoyed at this goofy, grown man claiming to be his son. After severalhijinks, Walter grudgingly accepts that Buddy is the real deal, butthat doesn't make life with him any easier.Buddy's undaunted Christmas-minded mentality makes him an annoyance tomost around him. He finds work at a department store where he falls inlove with a coworker (Zooey Deschanel). Buddy's quest leads to severalfunny sequences as he gets to know his dad and the various peoplearound him.Director Jon Favreau ("Iron Man", "Swingers") lets Ferrell do hisshtick but the narrative is held together very well. Some of the actorsare mild caricatures but they manage not to overdo it, since virtuallyeveryone is playing it straight compared to Ferrell's Buddy. Ferellplays Buddy as a man-child who is relentlessly positive, despite allthe grumpiness that he encounters in the Big City. Look for amusingsupporting parts by Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Artie Lange and AndyRichter.Since the film has no real villain, it allows the relationships to bedeveloped without an arbitrary "bad guy" foil to overcome by the end.In an era where original Christmas holiday films are frequently run ofthe mill, "Elf" stands out as a charmer. It's endearing without beingoverly saccharine.
