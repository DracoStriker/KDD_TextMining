In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friendsbecause he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it wasfree, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into thestory from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept mecrying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almostevery other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved inthe situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sadmoments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories arepredictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept meguessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the wholefilm.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it aneleven out of ten.
