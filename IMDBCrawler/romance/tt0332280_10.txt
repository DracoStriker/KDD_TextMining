there are three things I look for in movies, quality acting, a goodscript, and originality of the story...this movie had none of these.Could it have been any more cliché? the only thing that impressed mewas Allie's wardrobe and the car she was driving. I've seen betteracting on lifetime! and so many unnecessary parts that are completelypointless. "A walk to remember" is about a hundred times better and itdidn't get half the attention this movie did. If you're not awarealready, it's based on a book by the same author as "the notebook". ifyou want to see a moving love story you'll be disappointed from thisfilm unless you're 13...can't believe all the rave...it is notdeserved...a total waste of my time...
