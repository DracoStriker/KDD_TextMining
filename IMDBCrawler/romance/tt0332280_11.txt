My wife and I watched The Notebook last night. Within ten minutes wewere furious at how slow, cliché, and predictable it was. And then itjust got worse and worse. It was so very very bad that we were actuallydrawn to watch in perverse, embarrassed horror as each scene ploddedthrough stale, obvious dialog, and the actors tried to salvage what wasobviously a terrible muddle by overacting. I can't begin to convey justhow awful this movie is, in every sense. Leave aside the horrendouslydull, cliché-ridden script, the terrible acting, the ham-fisteddirecting, the swelling tear-jerker music, and the incredibly obviousplot -- Even the freaking costumes were terrible. The fake facial hairlooked like it was done by 3rd-graders. If movies are meant tofascinate, then this one did all right. I consider this the worst filmI have seen in at least five years, but rarely if ever have I (and mywife) been compelled to stay all the way through such abysmal crap outof some sort of hilarious anger at how were were wasting our own time.I mean we were jumping on the couches ad screaming in warped glee aseach predictable plot point was tediously checked off the director'schecklist. All the way to the very last shot (in the backstory) of hercoming back and them hugging in a swirl of stock sentimental stringmusic -- OF COURSE SHE'S COMING BACK. And the front story? They, uh,die TOGETHER? My God. We could not stop howling. Was he even sick? No.He just died -- just because! Because it went with the sickeninglysweet music, I guess. Then I come here expecting to be vindicated and Ifind a bunch of comments by people who were actually taken in by thisplodding, pathetic drivel. What in the world is up? I usually am withIMDb folks on their 7.8s, but man alive, folks, step away from theKool-Aid.
