"I am no one special. Just a common man with common thoughts. I've leada common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name willsoon be forgotten. But in one respect I've succeeded as gloriously asanyone who ever lived. I've loved another with all my heart and soul,and for me that has always been enough."Right. Are you sure it was enough? For you still had to write a"gloriously" stupid book (and make a "gloriously" stupid movie based onit)! Not only stupid. Trite, empty, boring... A glorious disaster!The characters are dull! Noah is what? Manic-depressive? Manic in thefirst 5 minutes, and throughout the rest of the movie depressive. Doeshe even fit the elderly character (you know, the grandpa who winks toyoung nurses)? Of course not. On the contrary, Allie is alwayshysterical, and all I got to hear were her constant screams. She seemsand sounds like she's trying to reanimate a dead person. (Noah?) Thatperson would probably kill her after the outcome and then peacefullydie again. I think she would do perfect in a role of the serialkiller's principal victim. Explicit edition only!The music is simply unbearable!!!And what about the children? There is only one scene with the all threeof them! How superficial does one need to be, to put them in only onescene, and have us believe that they are actually a big part of theirgrand love and happy fairy tale life? The daughter says "Dad come home,we miss you". But dad had more important issues. He loved mom so muchthat he had to call on the whole divine/ demonic/ extraterrestrial/voodoo/etc gang to make them die together?! Touchy. Who cares aboutchildren anyway.And sooooooo many other bugs... Damn I don't even know why I'm writingthis. I feel like one of Jeffrey Dahmer's zombies. Even that shouldfeel better than being this numb after watching this piece of... youknow what.The only good thing about this movie is Joan Allen's performance.
