It's the most cheesiest movie I have ever watched in my life. How,shallow a movie can get is well portrayed in the film "NOTE BOOK." Ifyou'd like to watch a classic love story, with nothing new with nooriginality please choose this title. It was the worst experience ever.The characters were not very well chosen, and the storyline is tooobvious. The script is poorly written. Not to mention that the writerof the book "Note book" is very conventional writer. I don't know howour society accepts a film with no creative spirit. I really think thatthis would be a great movie for maybe for relaxing time, but there isno need to really involve thinking as a matter of fact. It was a badexperience for me and I would never want to encounter such moviesagain, would like to stay away from romance genre, if people arecalling this a romance movie.
