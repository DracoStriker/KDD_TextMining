one of the worst films i have ever seen. poor script, corny, unpoetic,what more can you say? it had me laughing through this awful ordeal.anyone who liked this needs to go back to school. it is nothing morethan a midday TV movie. very poor b-grade flick. pityful. weak.unimaginative. i have nothing but contempt for this poor excuse of afilm. burn all the copies to wipe it from existence. please! if i couldgive it -10 i would. it doesn't take much to entertain some people. ifyou going to watch this for the first time just make sure you have acontainer to be sick into. you don't want to make a mess of your sofa.a disgrace. a blight in film history. a sickly corny pathetic, piece ofrubbish.
