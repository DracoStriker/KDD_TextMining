I can't believe someone agreed to make a film from this script.Everything is so blatantly obvious and no character goes through ajourney. They are all one dimensional and boring. There is nosuspension let alone any twists.Saying all this, the photography is good and the acting isn't that bad.Still this doesn't warrant 2 stars.Ah, yes, I'll just mention there are some uninspiring sex scenes andthe film is also at least half an hour too long.If you want to see a great love story where you feel with he charactersand don't know why or how until the end, check The English Patient.
