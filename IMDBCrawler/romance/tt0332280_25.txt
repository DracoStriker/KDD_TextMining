When they laid in the street to watch the lights change, I wanted anice- cream truck to run them over. It's awful. Another poor-boy-meetsrich-girl-and-her-parents-disapprove movie. If only Ryan Gosling'scharacter had fallen from the carnival ride and she'd married the carnydude who had been responsible for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in nearbyLot 7 of the Paramount Studios, then we might have had a movie worthwatching. What we need is more of the main characters in trite moviesto turn into cybermen with secret yearnings to marry daleks. And theyneed to eat green jelly beans - a definite sign of a moral deficiencyin any character, anywhere.
