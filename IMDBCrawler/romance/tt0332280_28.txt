I'm as much of a sucker for a good chick flick as any other woman, butthis is just ridiculous! It's the cinematic equivalent of eating one ofthose big plastic bags of cotton candy all by yourself...it might soundgood, but you'll feel kind of nauseated after.It alternates between a pretty young couple yelling at each other andthen groping each other, and their future selves in a Twilight Zonenursing home furnished right out of Crate & Barrel where all the femalepatients always have freshly applied lipstick. Almost all the plotpoints are telegraphed in about the first 10 minutes (except for thatsupremely stupid ending...they died happily ever after, just becausethey wanted to).A few observations: Why is she so surprised her mother hid the letters?Isn't that something a protective mother would do in those days? Didn'tshe know how to write? And considering they've been married for oh,about 50 or 60 years in the nursing home scenes, why do none of theirchildren look over 30? Did she serve a long stint in a convent at somepoint?
