Although they're fun to watch, most love movies are predictable afterseeing the first five minutes. The Notebook, however; keeps you gluedto the t.v and guessing. Rachel Mcadams' character is a more sweet anddisciplined rich girl who she plays beautifully. Ryan Gosiling alsobrings out the best in his character and together they make the perfectcouple. I'm not much of a romantic, but the scenes of them together arereally not easy to put into words. All i can say is that, if you're alove movie person, it's the movie for you. And if you're not, it'sstill the movie for you, to make you realise not all love movies arethe same.
