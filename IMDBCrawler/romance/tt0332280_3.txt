I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was justanother typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this filmand the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery isjust brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, andyou will care about them throughout the whole movie.The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot andbrilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant asthe shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful asthe star of the movie, Allie.As I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expectingmuch and that was because I thought it was a typical "boy loves girl"movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong,they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, butthere are simply too many in that particular genre.The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and theactors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good,and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hardrole as the "rich man" well. Another plus point about this movie wasthe great script, and you did not see too many "cliches" which isalways a good sign in a Romance movie.It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, thisis NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of themovie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking aboutthis movie for a long time.The only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think couldbe shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which iswell worth a watch.Go and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy.9 1/2 out of 10
