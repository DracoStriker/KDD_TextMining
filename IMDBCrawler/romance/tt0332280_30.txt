What a predictably maudlin movie. Rather than list the clichés usedhere, it would be easier to list the clichés passed up.Here's one...give it 110%. This movie gives about 30% at best. Theactors are sleepwalking so it seems. The only emotion in the movie (theawkward courtship/love scenes and Allie's annoying habit of squealing)are painful to watch.I only watched it to the end to make sure the two old fools died(everyone knew withing 15 minutes of the start what the situation was).Which makes it reminiscent of Titanic for me where I was hoping everyminute after the first 60, that Leonardo DiCaprio would just diealready.
