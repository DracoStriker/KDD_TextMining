This was one of the greatest love stories that I have ever had thepleasure of experiencing. Ryan Gosling was, as always, authentic in hisportrayal of Noah, a poor working class guy who falls in love withAllie, a beautiful rich girl who is staying in town with her family ontheir summer's vacation. The relationship is not well received byAllie's parents which leads Noah to make a decision that he feels is inboth of their best interests. The result of a hastily made decisionleads our main character down a road that first shuts out true passionas he tries to forget his past hurt. But, a stint in the military,where he experiences loss as well as his loss at home following hisservice in the military, leads him right back to his heart. The storyis deep and bittersweet, but ultimately rewarding. It doesn't get anybetter than this. Wow!
