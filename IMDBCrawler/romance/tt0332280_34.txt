I'm sorry. This movie is one of THE Chick Flicks of our time, and Ijust hated it. I get angry when people begin to discuss it at parties.My eyes flash and roll, my pulse quickens, and my breath whooshes outin indignation. Rachel McAdams was absolutely brilliant in "MeanGirls", but she had no place in this role. Adorable dimples are not agood enough reason for casting. Ryan Gosling was appropriately creepyin "Murder by Numbers", but again, not right for this romantic role.Drippy dialog and weak acting aside, here was my main problem with themovie. He never tried to find her. Why did he send the letters to herhome (where her disapproving mother was) instead of to her at school?Why did he never try to visit her at school or write to her at school?Why did she never try to write to him the entire time she was away atschool? I could not buy the greatest love story of all times from thesetwo, because they didn't even try. And unfortunately, neither actor wonme over through the plot flaws.
