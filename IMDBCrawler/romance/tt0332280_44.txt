Girl meets poor boy and they are kept apart by mean stereotypical richparents. She then gets engaged to a very nice man and sees it fit tocheat on him with her ex. But it all ends well because she is SO INLOVE with her ex. I don't think that helped her fiancé very much...I can't understand why this film is so popular. Perhaps it is becauseit lets women feel like anything they do is justifiable as long as theydo it for "love". It encourages selfish behaviour and revokes anyresponsibility in favour of instant gratification.Besides that, it was all very predictable and slow.Finally, speaking as a woman whose grandfather had serious dementia, Ithink it was really really ridiculous that he would confuse and upsether daily like that just for his own selfish needs. Anyone who has beenaround dementia sufferers would see how unkind/not at all plausiblethis story line is.
