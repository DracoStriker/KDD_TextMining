I am sorry, but this is another movie that I thought the actors usedfor the main characters were inappropriate; they did not bring acrossthe feeling they grew up in the south in the 50s. If one grew up in thesouth in the 1950s there would be a certain speech, and dignity that Ifelt not one of the main characters brought across. If they were goingto use these actors, they should have put it in a different location,which, also, would have changes a lot more. Now the supportingactors/actress all were very good, at least I felt they weresoutherners. I also felt the story was a bit contrived, but the properactors probably could have pulled it off.
