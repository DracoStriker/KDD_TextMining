I am a man who typically stays away from romantic films, but I don'tobject to watching one on occasion. After hearing good things about TheNotebook from some friends of mine, I decided that, having nothingbetter to do, I'd see what the stir was about. Big mistake.The Notebook is the weakest, blandest and most painfully boringdrama/romance I have seen in ages. There is nothing interesting aboutthe plot whatsoever, and the ending of the film made itself apparentright from the start. Expecting warm characters, good acting and a funstoryline, I was extremely disappointed. Instead of portraying theexperience of falling in love as being the truly magical thing it is,this movie makes it seem dry, tasteless and liable to put people tosleep.Thankfully I watched the film on DVD, so I had the fast-forward buttonreadily available for the boring, wide sweeping 'romantic' scenes. Ifyou are looking for a truly moving romantic film, I suggest LoveActually. Don't waste your time with The Notebook.
