My only excuse for going to see this film was the heat and humidity ofthe day. It must have been 90 degrees and 200% humidity in the shade!The temperature made me do it!Nick Cassavettes' style of direction is completely opposite of hisfather's, the otherwise innovative and genial late John Cassavettes. Inelecting to film this light weight book, he chose a possible easy crowdpleaser, or an excellent way to get me out of the sun into the airconditioning of the movie theater.The story is one cliché after another. The worst of the film is RyanGosling, an actor that must have a good agent behind him because if hehad to rely on his acting abilities, he'd starve to death. RachelMcAdams is irritating as Allie, the rich Southern girl at the center ofthe story.Gena Rowland's Alzheimer's is cinematic! Being confined to a nursinghome, she is groomed lovingly; her gorgeous shade of blonde, ismaintained by the attentive staff! Talk about a reality check! Thisfilm stretches one's imagination big time.How about David Thornton, as Allie's father. Was young Nick Cassavettesaware that he comes on the screen as the worst possible non-Southernstereotype in the movies throughout the ages? I always have to think twice about comments in this forum calling foran Oscar consideration so early in the year. Come next February, let'shope the colleagues of these "stars" will forget about them and of thisunfortunate silly film.Don't say you weren't warned. If you can choose between seeing thismovie and having a refreshing drink to calm your thirst and cool youall over: run into your favorite bar and have a summery pink drinkinstead!
