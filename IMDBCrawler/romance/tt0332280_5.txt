The Notebook is one of my all-time favourite movies. Its a constant,and classic love story that makes you feel as if you are there watchingit.. as if you are one of the characters, which makes the impact of thestory just that much more real. There really are no words to describehow this movie makes you feel, but one thing is for sure... It willmake you feel. After watching it, i've often just.. sat where i am andjust thought about it. It's just one of those movies that you willthink about 30 years after watching it, and still get that same feelingin your heart.. and you'll know that it touched you in one way oranother. If you haven't seen it, you really are missing out... Its aclassic!
