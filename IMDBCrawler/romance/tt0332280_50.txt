The Notebook is the best movie I have seen in a very long time! I lovethe story, the actors, the scenery...everything. I have NEVER criedwhen I watched a movie and this one made me cry like a baby in thetheater. Which was very emberassing if you ask me. But anyway, TheNotebook is the most touching love story I have ever seen. Not tomention Ryan Gosling is 2 die for hot! I can't wait until the moviecomes out on video. Which it will be out next month, so go out and buyit because it's such a great movie. Even if you don't see the movie,read the book. The book is just as good but provides a lot more detailinto the storyline. And honestly, I don't think the book is as sad.
