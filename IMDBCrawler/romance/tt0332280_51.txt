Overall, nice little movie. But it is also a bit 'tricked out.' That is, itis a bit manipulative and overly sentimental. I LIKE romantic movies,generally, and even some intensely emotional ones. I even cluck-cluck whenfilm critics attack anything with strong emotions, or too-real humanity,mentally scolding them for their shallow self-anointed mantel of thetoo-cool.Point is, I usually defend the 'sentiments' of humanity in movies! But here,I was (and to my great surprise) put off a bit by some of the formulaic vibeof the movie. It was kind of corny, and silly, and inauthentic. Again,though, it was nonetheless watchable. I gave it a 6 out of 10, and wouldhave posted a 6.5 if I could have.James Garner is magnificent in everything. Gena Rowlands is good, and goodhere. The guy, Ryan Gosling, may be a great human being, but his screenpersona is too creepy for me (recall his total creep-out role in 'Murder byNumbers'). The chick was good--- Somebody Mc-Something. Don't know her nameor work yet, but assume she will continue with a good career, and theneveryone will know her.
