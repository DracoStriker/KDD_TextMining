The first half of this movie is a cliché-fest - just about every lamelove story cliché is trotted out: the boy who does outrageous things toattract the girl, the poor boy who falls in love with a rich girl whohas parents who are shocked because the boy is beneath her (that one'sonly been done thousands of times before!), first love being the onlytrue love, etc.It was also obvious to me from the start who the old characters wereand it made it somewhat annoying to hear James Garner referring to hischaracter in the third person as he narrated the story.The movie improved somewhat in the second half, once the boiler-plateromance was out of the way and it started to become somewhat originaland more enjoyable. The improvement wasn't enough for me to recommendthis movie.
