Although this movie has accrued much acclaim by critics and fans alikesince its release, it has yielded no positive impact on the world offilm or society in general. It has led a generation of young women tobelieve that there is a Noah for all of us, and we deserve to be justas "misunderstood and rebellious" as Allie. "The Notebook", along withother popular rom-coms, has left most girls with a muddled line betweenfiction and reality. Though Nicholas Sparks may be talented as afiction writer, it is only because he knows how to manipulate thefemale mind into an emotional puddle. Aside from the beautiful Southernsetting (a Sparks trademark) and Ryan Gosling occasionally sweaty andshirtless, this movie provided not only no relatability for me, butalso did not provide even a fictitious escape.
