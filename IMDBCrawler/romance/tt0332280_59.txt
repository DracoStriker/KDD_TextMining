Well, I am not going to make many people happy, but...If a guy sent me a letter every day for a year, ON TOP of him havingsome of the temper issues the Gosling character had, EVEN IF I LOVEDHIM, even if my mother had been hiding the letters and even if he hadno idea that is why I was not responding, I would probably put arestraining order on his a-- (figuratively speaking), not keep runningback.If a girl I knew had the kind of emotional instability and spoiledsense of privilege of the McAdams character, I would run far away fromher as possible without regret. (Though, granted, if I I had had amother like the Joan Allen character, I myself would probably be thatmessed up.) I think someone else said: this is an example of how NOT tohave a relationship. It is not that I am so jaded, but ultimately I seethe relationship between the two as troubling rather than beautiful.And even if it was "just beautiful", have we not seen it before? Isn'tit kind of like The Titanic (minus the sinking ship) set in the deepsouth on the cusp of WWII? The actors were very good at playing peopleI would not care to know. If the acting were not so good, I would feellike I was watching an early 80s Pia Zadora movie or something, or atleast a slightly forgettable 50s melodrama that shows up on TCM at 3amonce in a while.Sorry if I offended. I don't mean to spoil other people's enjoyment,but I found myself actually upset with the way the film presenteddysfunctionality as great love, without a hint of irony.SPOILER ALERT: James Garner looks nothing like Ryan Gosling. And yet Istill guessed the "twist". Sigh.
