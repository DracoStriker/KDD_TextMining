Terrific tearjerker from a novel about a young mill worker (RyanGosling of MURDER BY NUMBERS) who falls for a socialite (Rachel McAdamsof MEAN GIRLS) in a small southern town circa 1940. The girl's stuffymother (Joan Allen) and WWII combine to quickly separate the two. Therest of the movie is how these two star-crossed lovers get backtogether. James Garner plays Gosling as an old man, reading excerptsfrom the girl's diary to her, now played by Gena Rowlands, mother ofthe film's director. The movie could have been just another chick flickin less capable hands. It is more than that thanks to director Nick(son of John) Cassevetes and his very capable cast. In particular,McAdams as the suffering socialite Allie is outstanding. She is a newJulia Roberts in the making (see the film if you don't believe me).Only James (X-MEN) Marsden as McAdams' hapless city-slicker suitorfails to ring true. He is a pretty boy of no discernible acting talent.Guys, you don't have to watch it but make sure you rent if for yoursweetie. She'll thank you for it.
