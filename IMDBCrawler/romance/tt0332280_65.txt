I usually don't like romantic movies much, but I adored this film. Fromthe start, this movie had a warm feel. The scenery was gorgeous, theacting was wonderful, and the script was so well-written. Therelationship between the two stars was amazing, and the chemistrybetween Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Goseling made this movie amazing. (Iam looking forward to seeing more of their work in the future.) THis isa very touching film, and quite beautiful. After seeing it, I wasn'table to stop thinking about it for days. It's a great date movie, and awonderful film for a rainy day. Just be forewarned that it's atear-jerker. Two thumbs up!
