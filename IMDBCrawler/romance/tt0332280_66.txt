I like every single type of movie. From sci-fi to thriller, fromfantasy to romantic. I have watch Gone with the Wind because people sayits the best love story ever, along with titanic, but i think that TheNotebook beats both of them. Its by far the best love story i've seen.It tells a great story, with good actors, and great scenes. It canrelate to everyone, because everyone knows, you just can't forget yourfirst love (or your true love.) The notebook doesn't follow the regularstyle of a love story, where two odds meet, dislike, like, fall inlove, separated by outsider, and end up together. It is more than that,and makes it more enjoyable.
