When I rate a movie on IMDb, and I have rated many, I start all moviesat a 5 (average). From their a movie exceeds or fails to entertain ormove its subject matter depending on the subject material being shown.Why tell you this? Because for me to give a movie a 9, you are lookingat movie that is a) Oscar material; b) The kind of movie that becomes aclassic.The movie is unique and has twists that some may or may not pick up onearly. Its handling of a gentle subject matter the range of emotionsthe actors use is outstanding. James Gardner surprises us near the endof the movie with so much depth that you truly suspend all disbeliefand feel as if you are secretly peeking into someone's room during aprivate conversation.The movie may be hard to watch for some and will pull at yourheartstrings at every opportunity while not forgetting to make youlaugh at other moments.As with any movie, there is always place for tweaks but this is aboutas perfect as a movie gets. This movie deserves your interruptedattention during the full two hours.
