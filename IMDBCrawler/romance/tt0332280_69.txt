There are 101 pages of reviews of this film, so why write another one??Well cause its Jan 2012, and tonight a fourteen year old girl sat withher dad and watched this film for the first time. She isn't a 'cryer'as such, in fact she hardly ever cry's whilst watching films, this oneshe did. More than that, when I asked what she thought she simply puther hand to her throat and mumbled the words... 'hard to breathe'! Thisfilm will leave you finding it hard to breathe.. it's simply that good.Ryan and Racheal are good.. but for me young Mr Garner steals theshow.. he is what makes the film for me.. his reading of the story isbreathtaking.. and there is one line that has stayed with me since thevery first time I heard it... "well thanks doc, you know what they say,science goes only so far, and then comes God.." If you haven't seen this film yet please, please take the time... mylittle girl was stunned by how good it was and she is very critical attimes. As for me.... twentieth time of watching.. and dad still cried at theend..
