This movie seems to be postcard perfect, a lesson straight out of thedirector's guide to romantic movies. Boy meets girl at a carnival, lovefrom the other side of the tracks, a date by the water, etc. And yetthe wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like astory you've heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and stillmoves you deeply. It really speaks about love in a way that mostromantic movies miss by speaking in cliché or over shoot by adding innumerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other greatmovies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost InTranslation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those othermovies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance.Too bad there can't be movies like this every year...
