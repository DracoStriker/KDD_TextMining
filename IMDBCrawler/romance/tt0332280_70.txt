Doesn't Rachel McAdams's acting make anyone else gag as much as me??Ugh. Granted, Nicholas Sparks is a dismally poor writer... he relies oncliché after cliché after cliché, w/out fleshing out any of hischaracters or plots beyond two-dimensional predictability, but McAdamsALmost ruins the entire affair for me. Wanting to act well doesn't meanactually acting well. She is cute, perky and tries very hard, but shesimply adds no depth to the bland character written by Sparks. Thestunning cast surrounding her (R. Gosling, G. Rowlands, J. Garner, S.Shepard) demonstrates how flatly-written roles can be imbued w/ depth,whereas she plays it exactly as it is written: "high-spirited Southerngirl torn between Southern gentry and working-class stud". Every time Ihear her fake laugh, I cringe and have to either look away or mimic herflailings. I definitely blame Cassavetes' direction, as well; I suspecthe was so taken w/ her cuteness, that he didn't recognize the vapidityof her performance. It wouldn't be the first time!! Ha ha. Theremarkable acting of R. Gosling, however (have you seen Half Nelson??Dude.), plus the stunning N. Carolina scenery, i.e., the righteouscinematography of Robert Fraisse, are what keep me coming back, timeafter time, even though it involves a lot or eye-rolling and heavysighs. I do think that, given the crappy aspects of the film, the onlyway you will enjoy watching this one is if you're a hard-up girl :)
