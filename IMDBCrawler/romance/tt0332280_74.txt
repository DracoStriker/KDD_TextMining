I love this film... Which is a big statement coming from someone whodoesn't normally enjoy romantic/sentimental movies! The characters areinstantly likable, the storyline moves at a good pace and there's agood mix of humour and intrigue as well as the obvious tear-jerkingmoments.The only possible criticism is that the plot is very predictable, soyou can guess how it's going to end more or less straight away... butthis doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film, as it's such abeautiful story you still want to know how the characters' lives playout.I would definitely recommend that people watch this movie at leastonce, but don't forget the waterproof mascara as I watched it with 4other girls and we were all in floods of tears by the end! And ifyou're not generally into this kind of film, don't let the idea oflove, romance and tears put you off, this film is definitely worth awatch!
