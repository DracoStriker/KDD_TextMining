Hi, My name is Yahaira and I am 25 years of age, I absolutely love thisfilm, I am a married mother of 3 children, all young ages. I am asromantic and passionate as anybody can possibly be, but as a full timemother sometimes without realizing it I neglect my marriage, I forgetthat I am also a wife and a woman with needs. I adore my husband andever since I saw this movie I take advantage of every free minute Ihave to kiss him, give him that special look or call him at work to sayI love you. I hope there's more people like me out there It's a shamethat there's not many real life love stories. I hope that in my nextlife there's a love story like this one. Congratulations to all thecast for an excellent job, the director, the producers and everyoneelse involved in this project, two thumbs up, keep making movies likethe Notebook.
