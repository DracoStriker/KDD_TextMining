I like Rachel McAdams and Joan Allen. They acted well here but couldnot save the bland and contrived plot and the awkwardness and cheeseoozing out of Ryan Gosling, as a prime example of the unbearablecharacterization with which the movie's 2nd half is filled. (the 1sthalf till they broke up at summer is pretty watchable). As Allie turnedto leave Noah's house after her mother's visit and Noah broke out in arage while reciting superfluous dialogue with a stiff palm on hischest, I just could not watch his performance for a second more (goodthing there wasn't any more of it)! How on earth does a man sound sojustified at getting mad at a woman leaving him, necessarily andpotentially temporarily to sort out a melodramatic mess because she'sengaged to someone else? Here's a loser who spent all his life missinga girl without any other ostensible ideals or goal in life (given Ididn't read the book), and whose morals and maturity, assumed to besound by default owing to an upbringing of stereotypical paternal loveand wisdom, are now collapsing into a heap. Other parts that made melaugh/cringe include widow on the verge of going back to loneliness,her place taken by a prettier and richer girl, experiencing sublimefeelings of love and hope, cheesy teary old Noah, and Joan Allen'ssudden hysterics of "I love your father". So every rich girl needs apoor boy and then gets split for romance? I always thought the Americandepiction of love and human nature is much more true to life, but itseems traditions are traditions, from the Qiong Yao and Korean dramasto America in the 40s, lol. For Rachel McAdams I would give it a 6; a 5for the over-ratedness and complete lack of empathy incharacterization.
