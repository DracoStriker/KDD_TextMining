The Notebook is a simple example of Hollywood tying to make life out tobe all happy, simple and like a fairytale. I had to sit through thismovie, and boy was it boring. It dragged on and on and on. It had avery stupid script, with corny and idiotic lines from poems that aretrying to make this movie memorable. Well let me tell you its onlymemorable for the lack of quality in this movie. The only good thingabout this are the special effects (such as the boat scene at thestart), which is why i gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10. The reason thismovie is so bad is because it is using a story that has already beenbeat to death in the movie industry - the happy ending love story. Alsothe stupid idea of the old lady (who ends up being the female maincharacter just older) magically regaining her memory temporarily,despite the fact she has dementia! Wow, what a miracle! All in all igive this boring, predictable and unoriginal movie 2/10 simply on thefact that the acting is average and the camera work and special effectsare passable.
