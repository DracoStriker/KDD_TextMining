The only thing good about this movie was the beautiful scenery. Theacting was decent but I'll probably only be able to view Rachel McAdamsas a popular and mean high school girl. The story was predictable andboring. I thought Allie was a superficial slut and didn't have anychemistry with Noah. Their relationship was based on looks and sexualdesire. I didn't see them have a true conversation once in the movie.Not only that, but when Allie was engaged she actually went and had sexwith Noah. That, to me, would seem like it would make her fiancé angry,but he didn't even care. The ending was disappointing, especially incomparison to the novel's, even though I didn't enjoy the novel either.It's one of the most overrated romances I have ever seen. I think Iprobably expected a masterpiece, and what I got was complete boredom. Iwould think twice before watching this movie.
