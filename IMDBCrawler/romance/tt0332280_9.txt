Prior to watching "The Notebook," I was not familiar with the work ofthe actress Rachel McAdams. She made an indelible impression bysustaining an outstanding performance in this film. Her character Allieis the pivotal role in the film, as she must make the crucial romanticdecision on which the story turns. There are few performers capable ofevolving the complexity of characterization as achieved by RachelMcAdams.The film recreated effectively the world of the 1940s in America,including the parental pressure exerted by the well-to-do family ofAllie on whether to allow their daughter to pursue a young man from theother side of the tracks. As played by Ryan Gosling, the character ofNoah could have revealed more emotional layers. There was only onescene in the film where he really showed that there was something atstake in his love for Allie. He apparently wrote her a passionateletter every day for a year. Especially in the film's early scenes,Gosling could have shown more of the passion.The other cast members were outstanding, including James Garner andGena Rowlands in the parallel story. In the two plots, "The Notebook"merits comparison with another outstanding romantic film, "The Bridgesof Madison County." As the two subplots of "The Notebook" cometogether, one of the key characters is Allie's mother. As always, JoanAllen delivers a convincing and complete character portrayal, as thewell-intentioned, but conflicted mother. In one of the most movingscenes in the film, the mother opens up to the daughter and tells herstory of youthful love and a fateful choice similar to the one Allieherself must face.My favorite scene in the film: a wonderful sequence where Noah andAllie are in a boat in the backwaters of South Carolina. The waterwayis simply filled with white geese. It is a stunning and picturesquemoment, among many in this well-crafted film. If there is such a spotin South Carolina, then I want to go there!
