Spoilers herein.There's a lovely Shinto tradition of folding prayers and leaving them ontrees. The more clever, careful and perfect the fold, the more whole the message willbe.I am in the midst of writing a book about `folding' in film. Folding in thiscontext refers to layers of some kind that carry double meaning. The simplest and easiest todescribe is the kind of folding in this little movie.A movie is a message sent to us and sugared enough in some way that we willreceive it. One of the most effective flavorings is the `love story' which though inventedby books is now exclusively owned by cinema. The message we send to ourselves and our lovedones about what love IS is a message that comes from films, each of which is a lowerorder of message.Sparks understands this, so he devises stories about messages. With `Messagein a Bottle,' he did it simply with one layer. Here, he employs three, which added to thetwo above makes five folds in this slick film, five origami birds approaching ourwindow.Sparks' three messages are:- the one from Noah to Allie every day- the notebook of the title that Allie wrote, effectively to herself to useher love to bring herself back to her love- the letters that Noah wrote, one per day for a year.Now whether you find the gauzy valentine haze too sweet, or the notion ofthe world (not just the world of love) too smooth and safe, you have to admire how thisfilm was conceived. These sorts of things don't happen by accident, they are engineered bypeople who study the deep cognitive mechanics of this business. Oddly, the plot suggests thathappy unengineered accidents are what are more real.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
