After watching this movie 2 days ago, i refuse watching any othermovies cause the satisfying feeling i had while watching is stilllasting. For me this is the perfect love movie. And i recommend thismovie to everyone including the people of modern day society who forgotwhat love is really about. After the movie ended it left me crying, andi'm as much a man as a man can be. This is the first time since i'vebeen a kid i cried cause of a movie. I pictured me and my girlfriendgrowing old together and this movie reminded me that love is thepurpose of life, to love and be loved. If you find this movie boring orjust didn't like anything about it, means you clearly are missingsomething in your life, lets all hope each of us finds true love intheir lives.
