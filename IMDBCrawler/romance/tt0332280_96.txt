This overly dramatic, soppy, STUPID film is driving me mad with rage!This film should have a warning at the start, saying WARNING! THISOVERLY SOPPY FILM WILL MAKE YOU KILL YOURSELF! Jesus Christ, this moviewas HORRIBLE!Okay, now that I've gone and had a mental breakdown because of howbadly overrated this film is, I've had a talk with my psychiatrist. Shesaid that I am experiencing a thing called "not following the crowd,"and that I'm going a little "mad with rage" over how bad the film was.She has spoken to me, and we have finally decided to put a stop to thewrong crowd of people from viewing this.I would of rated this film a one if it didn't have a sort of crowd thatsome people like. It's a soppy romantic drama like The Vow, Dear Johnand those other crappy films, and those crappy soppy films have a crowdthat I just can't understand. The movie (if it can even be entitled asone) is a film with over-the-top emotional music, over-the-top sadness,over-the-top...everything.I think that this film has one of the worst romance plots I've everseen in film. Yeah, these two are in love! Yippity yay, how sad,BOOOOORING!Overall, if you like romantic dramas, you will enjoy this, but if youdon't, STAY AWAY! STEER BLOODY CLEAR! My personal opinion is 0/10, butfor the wide range of audience, I give it a 6.1/10.
