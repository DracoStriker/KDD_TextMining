If you like corn syrup on your pancakes then this movie is for you. Itcops the slushy bits from lots of the romantic hits which I have loved:Last Picture Show, Splendor in the Grass, Great Gatsby, The Graduate,and so on. That's OK except the renderings are kind of inane. It's hardto imagine someone going ape for the girl - especially three times. Iguess the movie maker is hoping to convincingly romanticize his mom. Ifeel guilty for raining on a neurotic-girl fantasy. My wife liked it.I'd love our romance to hold up as well.
