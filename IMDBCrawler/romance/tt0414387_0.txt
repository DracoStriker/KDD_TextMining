Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor toboot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much morerealistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemedin keeping with the times. Another great addition is the pricelessDonald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more sceneswith Judy Densch. If those two can't chew up the scenery, nobody can.And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent thatit almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress whocan hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish thatit could have been 6 hours long.
