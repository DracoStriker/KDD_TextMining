Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with theenergy of a thorough novelty. "Pride and Prejudice" has been a favoritenovel of mine since I first read it and I've seen Laurence Olivier andGreer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and now Matthew MacFadyenand Kiera Knightly. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. Thematerial seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, isthe Darcy I've always imagined. He's been an actor I've followedfeverishly since his glorious Adrian LeDuc in "Apartment Zero", MatthewMacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense oflonging that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly isa ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagined thatshe was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here. Theother big surprise is Joe Wright, the director, in his feature filmdebut which is more than promising, it's extraordinary. Thephotography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, inparticular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new versionof a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies
