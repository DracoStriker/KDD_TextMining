For years I have waited for a Pride and Prejudice that perfectlycaptured the wit, the intelligence, the passion and the romance of JaneAusten's classic. The 1995 mini is fabulous, and I have watched it manytimes, but I have always been frustrated that while it got so much ofthe dialogue and the detail right, it somehow fell flat on some of themore subtle dynamics of the novel.Finally this movie adaption has captured what has before been missing!True, it took license regarding some of the verbiage and detail of thenovel, but it ultimately completely captured the characters, theirtransformations, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and theirpassions. You simply cannot do a definitive work on Pride and Prejudicein two hours. And this film doesn't try. But what it does attempt--tocapture the story and characters, it does beautifully. It is wellacted, well directed and connects as the book connected. While it hasto rush and skimp on scenes and characters, it is the most authenticand true to the spirit of the novel version that I have ever seen. Yousimply do not want it to end...Well done!!!! It was about time!!!
