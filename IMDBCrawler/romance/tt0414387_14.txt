This quintessentially English film is utterly charming - a verytraditional interpretation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel that manages toentertain, amuse and even move. First time director Joe Wright hasworked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and awonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. Theversatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, periodcostumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which muchlove has been lavished.At the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old KeiraKnightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second offive daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother.Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and thisis her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectlycast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy,but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors,including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie's irascible mother, Tom Hollander asa diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidableLady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie's wisefather).This is a Georgian world in which social conventions present averitable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in whicha formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as internationaldiplomacy. Pride and prejudice are only two of the obstacles to beovercome before inevitably true love brings Lizzie and her dark knightnose to nose (we don't even see a kiss). Passionate stuff indeed.
