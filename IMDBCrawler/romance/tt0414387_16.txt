Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed,as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride &Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes wereglossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed,unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each ofthe characters much at all. Not only that, this movie is Boring. I say that with a capital B. 1/3of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie tobe over. As I have read the book and watch the BBC version, I knew howmany scenes had to go, before I could finally leave the cinema. MrDarcy whoever he is in this movie, definitely can't act. He looks alsotoo young to play Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth isrushed like he needs to get through the script or something. Where isthe build up? At first, he seems confused with everything. He is justbizarre! It all looks put on. Was trying not to compare to the Colin Firth version but if you lovethat version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway.The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I knowElizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress as somesort of ladylike fashion, and hasn't been brought up in a squaller. Herdresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of England.I didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact, that Idon't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to dosuch things, honestly Mr Bingley who has wealth should know better.There is some things that are said that sound too modern for the periodthis movie is set in, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley'scharacter is shockingly donee, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not acharacter to like and respect. What about that laugh of his!!! IWickham hardly has a presence and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a couple of othercharacters have no presence at all. Keira did okay, but it just ain'tthe same.
