A "modernised" version of Jane Austen's classic novel that should notbe compared unfavourably with 1940 Hollywood Olivier / Garson versionnor several BBC serials culminating in the most acclaimed TV seriesversion from 1995 with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle-a personalfavourite. This 2005 film clocks in 127 minutes (UK / Europe)& 135 minutes (USA &Canada) -the extended version allowing audiences to share more of thetimeless love story with the main characters -Elizabeth Bennet & MrDarcy. Director Joe Wright plus his screenwriters ( Oscar winner Emma Thompsoncontributed to the final screenplay) have chosen to emphasise ElizabethBennet / Mr Darcy plus Jane Bennet/ Mr Bingley story lines & reduce MrWickman, Charlotte & Mr Collins to supporting characters.Austen's famous wit,satire & humour that forms the basis for herenduring appeal (Pride & Prejudice was finally published in 1813 &continues as an annual bestseller)is sidelined to open up this versionas more emotional drama for modern audiences.If you are open to a newer interpretation, can avoid comparisons to thenearly 5 hour 1995 TV version which allowed for greater depth & detailin telling all the characters story lines & accept some of the newfilm's rushed story lines-you are in for a treat .....New British star Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennet))excels in her firstreal leading actress role ably supported by fellow Brit Rosamund Pike(Jane Bennet) as the sisters supportive of each other's & their Bennettfamily problems.Knightley at 20 is the right age for her character,thisallows Elizabeth's girlish personality plus her character's pride,misjudgements & loving nature to shine through....Great star turns from Brenda Blethyn as their mother Mrs Bennet plusOscar winner Judi Dench as fearsome Lady De Bourgh (Mr Darcy's aunt)adddepth to this film version.Claudie Blakley as Elizabeths's wise friendCharlotte Lucas & Simon Wood's amusing Mr Bingley are delightfulsupporting performers. One major surprise is Canadian actor Donald Sutherland's touchingperformance as Mr Bennet -capturing both the humour of living in an allfemale household & five daughters to look after with the poignancy ofseeing his eldest children's difficult relationships develop -easilyhis best acting performance in years. In the difficult role of Mr Darcy rising British star Matthew Macfadyen(BBC's Spy series Spooks & Award winning New Zealand film "In MyFather's Den" rises to the occasion.With the short running time, thereis not enough time to allow Darcy's repressed & prejudiced personalityto be fully represented -Macfadyen perfectly displays Darcy's social &class problems, his unfortunate attempts at gaining Eliabeth Bennet'sinterest & his painful adjustments to achieve their personal lovestory.Macfayden & Knightley's objectionable first dance,theirembarrassingly moving Collins House meeting,the unexpected Pemberleyencounter plus their two proposal scenes are highlights of this film. Engaging acting performances with wondrous film photography,filmlocations at some of United Kingdom's most famous stately homes,marvellous film sets & costumes plus one of 2005's best original musicscores add greatly to this new film version. All in all one of the better films of 2005 -not perfect film making andnot intended to be as subtle as Austen's novel -but a wonderfulsurprise with some changes to present a modern version of Pride &Prejudice for current audiences -do see this film as & when it isreleased worldwide....And after seeing the film or re-visiting 1995 BBC TV series -read theoriginal novel for its classic storyline, memorable characters &Austen's brilliant writing style,wit & humour.....9 Out Of 10 for this different interpretation of an enduring classic
