Having attended a regional charity premiere last night I can safely saythat the actors chosen have more than succeeded in bringing theircharacters to life. This adaptation hit the perfect note every time interms of humour, romance and warmth. Keira Knightley plays awonderfully spirited Lizzie and MacFayden really hits the spot as adour yet shy Darcy. The whole cast throw themselves into their roleswith gusto and overall the film left this viewer charmed and delighted.Its obviously going to have a tough time proving itself to those wholoved the BBC adaptation as that seems to have become for so many THEadaptation of the novel, but give this one a chance, those that don'twill be missing out. Sorry to keep this brief but I don't want to beaccused of giving anything away!
