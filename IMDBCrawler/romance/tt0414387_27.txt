The sparkling wit, the colourful detail, the absorbingly realcharacters and the familiar concerns of the inhabitants of Pride andPrejudice made the book and several movies into timeless classics. Thisnew movie adaption highlights the brilliance of Austen and theexcellence of a faithful reproduction.Sadly, it highlights these qualities by their absence.The scriptwriters have carefully excised any traces of wit or charmfrom the dialogue and, thanks to the removal of Austen's subtlecharacterisations, every piece of action and every decision is nowexplained in excessive detail as though the audience is not capable ofthe simplest interpretation.An excellent example is the famous scene when Elizabeth first meetsLady Catherine de Burgh in her house at Rosings. The original scene wasa cleverly played battle of wills between the two strongest charactersin the story, as they pitted politeness against intrusiveness, honestyagainst artifice and youthful pride against middle-aged prejudice.Keira Knightley and Judi Dench, utterly failing to capture the spiritof either character and left with a poor excuse for a script, areunable to establish the tension that is needed between these charactersfor later plot developments to have any sense or meaning.Ms Dench, so sublimely witty in the same dress as Lady Bracknell in"The Importance of Being Earnest", is too attractive, too dignified andquite unable to capture the repressive spirit of Lady Catherine.In scene after scene, the set, costume designers and directors fail tocreate a believable Georgian setting. Lizzy walks about the town inwhat appears to be a work dress, hatless and gloveless; Mr Bingleybreezes into Jane's sickroom at Netherfield; Caroline Bingley parades asleeveless dress at a ball; and Mr and Mrs Gardiner expose their nieceto the vulgarities of a common tap room at an inn instead of hiring aprivate parlour or at least sitting in the coffee room.In the end, the drama and romance can't quite carry off the finalreconciliation of this poorly realised couple. One can't help feel, atthe end, Keira Knightley would have made a better Lydia, or even adecent Jane. Mr Darcy is barely distinguishable from Mr Collins anddisappointment lingers that Austen's clever way of setting up CharlotteLucas as the future Mrs Collins has been replaced with a crude andunnecessary tiff between her and Lizzy.The drab music is mitigated by beautiful scenery, however, and in acourageous move many parts of the movie are shot in the semi-darknessof a candlelit world. The gorgeously fashionable setting for Mr Darcy'sinitial scene of proposal almost makes up for the puerility of hisspeeches, and for a while there I really thought the movie wouldsucceed in creating a meaty, realistic, tangible world through itscrowded ballrooms and earthy minor characters.I recommend this movie to students and fans of Austen everywhere, as itis only when the quality of Austen is removed from the story that weappreciate how special it is.
