OK where do I begin? First the writing: the idiot who wrote thisscreenplay thought himself superior in writing to Jane Austen anddecided to replace Austen's superb economy of words with his ownramblings. Second of all the whole story completely lacks theunderstanding of social interactions and mores that governed the early19th century British society. At the time, a woman of 19 or 20 wasexpected to fully run a household and a gentlewoman was expected tohandle many servants as well. Kira Knightly plays Elizabeth as agiggling airhead more at home at the main shopping drags of Paris,London and Los Angeles now than in 19th century British countryside. Toadd to the travesty we have Donald Sutherland playing Mr. Bennet not asa British eccentric but like an ex-hippie. It is as if Sutherland ischanneling his character from Kelly's Heroes.As for other characters, Darcy is forgettable. One wonders why anyonewould love him Judy Densch has too much bearing to play the foolishLady Catherine. Finally, Mrs. Bennet is not the oaf that Jane Austenmakes her to be.Having said all this, the main problem with this movie is that it is a"Romantic" movie in the true sense of the word, i.e., its heart and itsvalues are those associated with the romantic movement of mid 19thcentury. However, Pride and Prejudice the book is decidedly"unromantic" and "rationalistic." While romanticism is based onrebellion against convention, Pride and Prejudice is rather acelebration of social convention. The people who would be romanticheroes in other novels, i.e., Wickham and Lydia are treated as foolsand knaves. On the other hand Elizabeth and Jane, fall in love withinthe conventions of the day and are given full rewards and happyendings. This movie is contrary to that spirit.
