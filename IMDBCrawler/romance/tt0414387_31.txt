I really hated this - it is OK to modify scenes from the book, but tochange the spirit of it completely is too much. And to change JaneAusten's witty dialogue for some of the dross, especially early on inthe piece was definitely not an improvement.This loud, grubby group were not my idea of the Bennetts or theirfriends. The Bennetts may have been poor and may well have lived in ashabby house, but they had more class than this lot.As for the proposition that Darcy's aloofness was because he shy andnot confident, he just seemed pathetic to me and Darcy should certainlynot be pathetic. Except for the scene where he gave a lovely smile - Mathew MacFadyenwore the same expression pretty much throughout, (which was notsurprising as this Darcy was such a boring character), and KieraKnightly just seemed much to flighty for Lizzy, she seemed more likeLydia.To me - it is the Benny Hill version of P&P - no subtlety, little wit,almost just slapstick.Thank God for the BBC.
