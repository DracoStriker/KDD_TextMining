I saw "Pride and Prejudice" and was disappointed.This version of Jane Austen's novel guts the story of its socialcommentary and leaves behind a flopping insipid Harlequin romance.Or as a more eloquent writer, Langston Hughes wrote about "Porgy andBess"Paraphrased (what I remember of the review): It is the frothy foam of a mug of beer. You tilt it into your mouthexpecting a full-bodied brew and all you get it is the foam. Thebubbles burst on your tongue hinting of the taste but it is light andfull of air. It is unsatisfying.
