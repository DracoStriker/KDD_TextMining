I cant speak English perfectly, so i hope you'll forgive me.Gosh...What to say about this movie? First, i have to say i've seenPride & Prejudice directed by S. Langton with J.Ehle/C.Firth (BBC 1995,more than 360 mins) and i consider that film a masterpiece. Maybe i ama bit one sided when i speak about this new version of the film, butsince for the very beginning of it i understood it would have been apoor thing: first of all, (as the most of the USA historical film) itis completely unfaithful: eg. in the first ball scene Lizzy asks Darcyif he wants to dance! Come on! Was Joe Wright out of his mind? A ladyasks a gentleman to dance in the Victorian England period??! That's anonsense as the most of the things shown in the movie. Second, what tosay about the figure of Mr Collins? It should be a comic figure (as hewas in Langton's film), but here looks more like a psycokiller. AndWickham? He is just the poor,gay, version of Orlando Bloom. What aboutDarcy and Bingley? the first one is really nothing in comparison withthe great performance of Colin Firth and the second one is reallyridiculous in the part of a weak gentleman. And Lizzy & Jane? They actlike a '90 teenagers more than ancient English women. Too bad. AlsoKeira Knightley that usually acts good (a part to be one of he finestcreature on the earth)in this film seems confused and acts hystericallyin some part of it. Poor Jane Austen...
