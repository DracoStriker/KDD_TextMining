i don't think i have ever seen a worse version of one of Jane Austensclassics. Not only is this film confused about which time period itsmeant to be in, but the story has been mutilated beyond comprehension,if it hadn't been for the title at the start of the film i would havethought i'd walked into the wrong screen, and i cant think of a worseactress to play ELizabeth Bennett than Keira Knightley. Pride andPrejudice is not only my favourite book but the Colin Firth version isalso my favourite drama and Elizabeth Bennett a strong character with acertain essence and intelligence which Knightley was incapable ofbringing to the fore. And as a lover of Jane Austens work i have to sayi couldn't be more disappointed with this film and any one who lovesPride and Prejudice should stay well clear of this so called re-tellingof Jane Austens classic.
