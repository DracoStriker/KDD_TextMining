Keira Knightly (Elizabeth Bennet) cheesy smiled and giggled her waythrough whole movie. Although she was the best of a bad bunch she didnot portray the Elizabeth Bennet of the Austin novel ? never even cameclose.Matthew MacFadyen would have been better cast as one of the un-dead inLand of the Dead movie as his acting was as wooden as a flesh eatingzombie.Simon Woods (Mr Bingley) with his crop of ginger hair and imbecilicsmile. Did the makers of this movie really expect us to believe that abeautiful woman like Jane Bennet could ever fall in love with such apiece of quivering, stuttering jelly? Donald Sutherland (Mr Bennet)looked like he was one step away from insanity. I was half expecting tosee him eat the dragon fly he was examining in his study.Not only did Mr Bennet act like he was one step away from the mentalinstitution two of his daughters giggled like half wits through thewhole movie to thus convince me insanity ran in the family.The 5th daughter looked so depressed throughout the movie I was halfexpecting the director to take liberties with the Austin novel andinsert a scene where the rest of the family found her hanging from therafters.And Mr.Wickham? He was in the movie? Where? When? Apparently he wasonly given a cameo part to allow more time for the director to focus onbare butts of statutes in Darcy's home.This movie was a torturous mess from beginning to end. Bring back GreerGarson and Lawrence Oliver.
