I couldn't agree with the one star crowd more. This simply doesn'tcompare with the BBC series. Jane Austen's spirit is not present, thething is witless and illustrative. Even worse, it's conceived in aneye-poking populist manner. The proper costumes of the classicistperiod were swapped for a mishmash of later styles for a 'better' look,and the story itself was relieved of Austen's social observations, andwarped into something imponderous like a daytime soap. It's Lizzie'snew version that this weightlessness is most evident in: she's allattitude and no personality. And no discipline either: she gigglesdownright stupidly all the time, like a spoiled brat long overdue for apunch in the nose. Watching this atrocity, I couldn't help thinking ofthe 'creative' team of braindeads behind it. How much they must havebeen struggling to make every aspect and detail 'consumable', i.e.dumb. I'm afraid they have fully achieved their goals with this messdevoid of competence, style and respect.
