I think the Cliffs Notes for 'P&P' might have more of the nuance of thenovel than this rubbish - and I'm not entirely convinced anyone in theproduction team even looked at those. This version is just bizarre - nosense of time period, how people really lived, how people behaved - whymake a period film if you're not interested in the period? Good grief,there were costumes from 50 years prior to the time, and then one fromthe 1990s. And pigtails like Dorothy's. But that's besides the point -to paraphrase from the book, it's the total want of thematic honesty souniformly betrayed by everyone involved in this production thatabsolutely sinks it. Unromantic, unfunny and completely uninteresting -if you want the pleasure of this story, curl up and read the bookagain.
