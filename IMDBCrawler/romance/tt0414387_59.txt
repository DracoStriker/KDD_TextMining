Pride and prejudice is my favorite book ever, I read it twice a year,and it always thrill me... Maybe I expected too much be I was verydisappointed... Keira Knightley is quite OK, but she always keep thesame expression on her face during the whole movie (pouting most of thetime!), and she plays a very arrogant Lizzy. Matthew Mc Faydyen is OKtoo, cute and charming, but he looks like he's going to cry everysecond of the movie! The other characters are dumb (like Mr Bingley!)or vulgar (like Miss Bingley), or for most of them, transparent... youdon't care about them... But the thing that really ruined the movie wasthe disrespect of the proprieties... They mattered so much to thesociety in this time, and are very important in the book... that's thebasement of P&P... and here, they meet at night when they are in theirnightdress, Bingley come into the room where Jane is lying ill, andstart to talk to her... amazing to think it's in 1795 in thearistocracy...To finish, the director tried to mix Jane Austen with the BrontëSisters, which hated Jane's writings, by the way... and it'sunbelievable to see Mr Darcy and Lizzy together under the rain, he,telling I love you... Where is Heathcliff? screaming and hitting treetrunks with his head?Cant' believe that with a wonderful story, and so much money, theyruined the movie... I understand that if you didn't read the book, youcan like this movie, but if you did read it, you can't like it!
