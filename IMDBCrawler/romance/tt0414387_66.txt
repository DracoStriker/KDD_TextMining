I thoroughly enjoyed this film, much more than I thought I was goingto. I'm not a huge fan of period drama but love historical films ingeneral so wanted to give it a go.I haven't read the book (have too many I want to read as it is)and havenot seen the TV version so I am considering this as a film in its ownright, not as an adaptation.The acting was brilliant from nearly all concerned (particularly KeiraKnightley and Donald Sutherland) and the film keeps a good pace (slow,dragging stories are usually my concern in this type of film).The one let down could maybe be one of the sisters (sorry, can'tremember name) who was incredibly annoying - but she may be meant to bethat way.Cinematography was also stunning. This, combined with the outfits ofthe cast, make Pride and Prejudice a visual treat.
