I thought this film was brilliant.Keira Knightley performs extremelywell in the fight she has with Mr.Darcy.Matthew MacFayden also can bepraised on his performance in this remarkable film.All the cast exceedsmy expectations and i recommend it to all.A feel good movie which isn't like one of those films based on a novelwhere the actors speak word for word from the book.Jane Austins classicis retold in one of the best movies i've seen in many years. I can'twait until this film comes out on DVD and VHS,please please please goand see this movie with all of your friends-it has some unexpectedhumour which could have you in fits of giggles.
