This was a beautiful Pride and Prejudice. Out of all of the ones that Ihave seen, this one portrayed the book the most accurate, it made it soyou believed what you actually read years ago, and it made you thinkthat it could have really happened. The casting was very good Ibelieve. I didn't like some of the cast like the guy who played Mr.Collins but he did a wholeheartedly job on it. Keira Knightley was bornfor the role. If you don't believe me, read Pride and Prejudice. Notthe abridged version though. I have seen 2 versions of the movie beforeI saw this one and this one was the best. Matthew Macfayden was aperfect Mr. Darcy. The chemistry between him and Keira Knightley wasbrilliant. And the scenes were made so that you wanted to be there. Youwanted to feel the sunlight and everything about them. I loved all ofthe movie and would see it again for anything. The clothes werewonderful, the directing was wonderful, the scenery was wonderful, theprops were wonderful, the special effects were wonderful, everythingabout it was wonderful.
