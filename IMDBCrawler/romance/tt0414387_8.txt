If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, thenthis farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be consideredvaguely endurable.From the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awfulacting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit ofJane Austen.Whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellentJudi Dench) who have obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let aloneread her, should be punished! Keira Knightley grimaces and grinsthrough every scene, and came across as being so obnoxious that no-onewould want to marry her! Darcy looked as if he was trying to rememberhis lines throughout the whole film and the rest of the Bennet girlswere interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters asthey were originally written.This version failed to show the proper Pride and Prejudice that bothDarcy and Elizabeth suffered from and, at the end of the longest twohours of my life, who cared whether they got together or not!Absolutely abysmal - even the too few minutes of Judi Dench cannot savethis rubbish. I cannot think of anything good to say about this filmapart from that it eventually ended!
