I have seen the original and every remake of this classic tale, as itis my favourite period drama, and this must come top at being the worstyet and in the 21st century surely the film industry is capable of muchbetter.Beautiful scenery, accurate costumes and pretty actors do not make afilm great. This remake failed completely to build any of thecharacters, to really show the early animosity between Elizabeth and MrDarcy, let alone give reason for it. There was little to show theterrible plight that the youngest daughters elopement brought on thefamily or the importance of Darcy's help, in fact the whole filmcharged through the story like a high speed train, showing a bit ofscenery but not being able to stop long enough to appreciate any of it.The characters were dull and lifeless, I have always felt some emotion,if not quite a bit, watching the films but this gave me nothing at alland I can cry at adverts.I was utterly disappointed in everything about the film and was amazedthat they even felt the need to alter the story unnecessarily whenthere was far too little time in the 127mins to do justice to the storywithout the improvisation. A complete waist of time and money
