Sadly, this movie did not live up to my expectations (which I mustadmit are low, as I own the 1995 BBC version of Mansfield Park). Atleast in Mansfield Park, they didn't change the intent of the humor andflavor of Jane Austen, it was only poorly cast. In this version ofPride and Prejudice, the Bennett family was not portrayed in the propersocial class; Darcy and Elizabeth would have never met. Darcy wouldhave never fallen for such a low class family. The scenery wasexquisite, however it alone could not hold my attention. I couldn'tlook at Donald Sutherland and not ask myself, "What the heck is hedoing in this film?" If you're a Jane Austen fan, I give this movie twothumbs down. Rent or buy the A&E six hour version, which is as close tothe book as anything produced to date. Better yet, read the book, whichis far superior to anything ever produced!
