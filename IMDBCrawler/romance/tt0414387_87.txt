Wonderful adaptation of the classic.As a fan of the BBC TV series, I arrived expecting to be disappointed.I could imagine Matthew MacFadyen as Mr Darcy after his great role inSpooks, but must say I was sceptical of the casting of Keira Knightley(Elizabeth Bennet) and Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet). Was I wrong!Casting was spot on and the cinematography was a visual feast. I lovedthe contrast between the slightly-down-at-heel Bennet house and theGreat Houses. Music was wonderful throughout, as were the immersive,pulsating scenes at the Balls.The story remained very faithful to the book (as far as I canremember!), with the editing along the lines of a "Readers DigestCondensed Book" contraction rather than wholesale re-writing. Fewliberties taken here, thankfully, and those quite acceptable in theinterests of fitting to the feature length.Music, acting, production - all great. Go and see it. A new entry on my"favourite movies" list.
