Having seen the BBC mini-series shot 10 years ago, I was really hopingthat this adaptation would be just as good or better. Don't get mewrong, the mini-series was wonderful. The acting was great and so wasthe cinematography. But it was 6 hours long. Someone who wants to watchthat needs to be really interested, or they will switch off half-waythrough the story. I was so happy that this new adaptation managed to capture the flavourof the book, without giving up too much. Sure, everyone complains whenscenes are cut, but how else are you supposed to adapt a novel withoutmaking it 6 hours long? The main points of the story were there,although I agree some more of Wickham and Lydia's story would have madethe point of why it was such a scandal more clear. It was successfullyadapted to 2 hours. This means that newcomers to Jane Austen'swonderful novel won't be bored to tears by the end of it. Many peoplecan not handle that much period at once.Besides the wonderful acting on everyone's part, the movie wasexquisitely shot. I especially liked the shots where the camera wandersaround the ball or house. It made it seem less like a movie, but morelike an intimate look into what life was like. Needless to say, thecostumes were wonderfully designed and beautifully made. I thought thedialogue, which stayed very true to the book when it could, was witty,interesting and made me laugh in all of the right places.All in all, I couldn't ask for a better 2-hour adaptation of a classicnovel.
