I went to see suspecting I would hate it, I did. Everything about itwas wrong; it was like they were filming a different book. Granted thelocations and houses very lovely (if not a little miscast-yes even thehouse were wrong for their parts) Keira was too modern, dull andfrankly I found it unpleasant to watch her. Were everyone else seesDarcy as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustratedand inadequate. Bingley was stupid and dippy (he isn't meant to be) andthe Bennett's were shown to be destitute and for some unknown reasonfarmers, this is incorrect and ludicrous. The very idea that Mr Bennettwould answer the door in his night gear with the rest of the familydressed in their underwear to in the middle of the night is stupid.They had servants. Mr Collins was not repulsive and greasy merelystupid and obnoxious, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingleywore a sleeveless dress, what! As if! It is Historically inaccurate andeven the ending is unsatisfying. I could go on for days. I hated it somuch as not only was it nothing like the book but I fear that for manypeople it will be their fist experience of this great novel and it willgive them the worst possible idea of it. The BBC version is so superiorit's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult toits memory. In short if you must see it be sure you have read the bookfirst or seen the BBC version other wise you will be lead done thedeluded road that this is what it's like, which its not!
