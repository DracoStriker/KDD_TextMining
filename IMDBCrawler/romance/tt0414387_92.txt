i have just returned from seeing this and i have to say, i have rarelyseen a film that, on a scale of 1-10, i would give a 15.oh my, the ridewas so exhilarating, i am actually winded!i think i have actuallyexperienced the most romantic movie i have ever seen, and i am speakingof romance in the full-blown love sense. i am not used to writingecstatic praise, but this film is so PERFECT that i cannot help myself.i have seen all the Jane Austen film adaptations and i have been a bigfan of many of them, particularly Persuasion. This film was, for me,tremendous because it PUT ME IN THE MOMENT.I was living in that time,with those people, with the sounds and the spaces and the colors andthe light.To begin with, this film finally got me to grok this Englishthing about the difference between the middle and the UPPER classes.The film begins by introducing you to the small crowded rooms and noisygoings on of a 5-girl middle class family.Later you will be shown theastounding austere spaciousness and silence of a very upper classabode.Socially, the dichotomy continues to be shown with the loud ,merry,crowded middle class country ball v.s. the silent, low-tonedrestrained and awkward conversations in the drawing rooms of thewealthy. While their worlds are opposite in most ways, the maincharacters,Elizabeth and Darcy, are both frank, stubborn, head strong,secretive and loyal to those they love.Their relationship,the continualpulse of their push and pull, is the heartbeat of this enthrallingfilm.The acting, every single performance, is spot-on, and thechemistry between the 2 leads is truly provocative and compelling. Dosee this film soon; you will not be disappointed.
