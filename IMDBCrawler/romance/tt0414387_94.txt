Sometimes directors really make you think, make you stop and considertheir work, make you want to never ever see anything in the cinema everagain because they have killed any desire you might have felt formoving pictures. Wright has almost managed to do this.I mean, how does one go about transforming Austen's Pride andPrejudice, a book full of wit and humour, into something so dreadfullyboring? And I can't blame the dialogue, because a lot of it was lifteddirectly from the book. And I can't blame the actors because I've seenthem do so much better in other works, and there is one scene in thisfilm that hints at how good this film could have been. Who is left toblame? Well, the director who instead of giving us a romantic comedyinstead decided to show off his camera skills.Ohh, look at the countryside. See the strange camera angle. And whatwas with the porcine fetish? Did I really need to get that close to apig's testicles? The one good thing about this film, it was so terribleI was actually in fits of laughter in the middle of it. Never beforehas seeing some one walking, walking, walking through the mistycountryside been so humorous. I'd swear I laughed for ten minutes. AndI so wanted to just shout out "How lame is this entire film" but Iresisted out of courtesy, although I'm not quite sure if anyone whoenjoyed this film deserves any respect at all.It may seem like I'm being a bit harsh on this film, but that is onlybecause it deserves it. Knightly looked ridiculous in her costumes. Allthey did was emphasize how flat-chested she is (something that didn'tcrop up in Pirates?), and made her look, well terrible. And speaking ofterrible; Matthew McFadyen, what the hell happened to you? A man whowas great as the taciturn, withdrawn character in Spooks, is here apasty-grey faced twit.
