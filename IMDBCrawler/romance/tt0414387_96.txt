I owe this film my last hangover. In order to get over its awfulness, Iwent and got seriously drunk.Jane Austen 's fans, don 't watch it, it will kill you.Non Jane Austen 's fans, please don 't judge her work based on thatparody of an adaptation.Keira Knightly, I really like you, but if you think you 're such agreat actress that you can make anything a success just by being you,think again. You didn 't even try to act.Matthew Mac Fadyan, who on earth told you that Mr Darcy should looklike a dog that 's been beaten up with a newspaper? You barely changedan expression in the whole while! Flat, boring and thus outraging formillions of fans - that 's what your performance was. Good news is, thefuture Darcies need not worry. It just doesn 't get any worse thanyours. Rosamunde Pike, you were the only oasis in this wretched film. Ibelieve you would have been a very decent Miss Bennett, had the scriptallowed you to. Joe Wright, you destroyed both Pride and Prejudice and Anna Carenina.Haven 't you had enough yet? Please keep your future plans away fromperiod drama - perhaps Knightly, too. It worked for both of you inAtonement, but it just doesn 't do it any more.The rest were too indifferent to even mention.Abominable film in every possible way. Beware.
