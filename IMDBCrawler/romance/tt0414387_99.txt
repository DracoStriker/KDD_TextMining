I have tried watching several times and usually don't get past thefirst 10 minutes but I have forced myself to watch it all the waythrough (in the vain hope that it would improve).The Bennet's are a reasonably wealthy and high status family just notrich or titled. As Elizabeth herself says 'I am a gentleman'sdaughter'. Yet they are portrayed in the film as farmers, with mud andlivestock in front of the main door of the house. The house was ashambles, dark and dreary. In the most part their clothes would not befit to be seen in 'polite society'. And their hair and complexion looksmore like a poor farmworker than a genteel family. Where are theservants? There is no attempt in the film to explain one of the basicissues of this period in history - which is that if the five Bennetgirls do not marry money, when their father dies they will have nothing(as it would by law all go to Mr Collins). This issue drives thebehaviour of all of the characters.The whole film seems to run on the premise of poor girl, pretty butwith attitude, fancies rich bloke, and gets him in the end. This is notthe point of Jane Austen's work at all. The point of the book as I seeit is that Elizabeth's character will not allow her to compromise herown feelings to secure her future (and thereby also secure the futurefor her sisters). Her prejudice against Mr Darcy builds based on hispride at their first meeting (the assembly), her perception of the poortreatment of Mr Wickham and the understanding that Mr Darcy influencedMr Bingley in such a way as to upset her sister, Jane.The cast had potential, all very talented actors, but I think was letdown by an awful script/screenplay and terrible direction.I do not feel that this film is fit to use the title Pride andPrejudice or the name of Jane Austen as it does no credit to either.If anyone want to see a more representative production of Pride andPrejudice then watch the BBC series (screenplay by Andrew Davies) whichI would give 9 out of 10.
