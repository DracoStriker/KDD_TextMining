Not only is the set very obviously there and visible there is verylittle of it. The rooms depicted are historically quite incorrect as isthe outside depicting what looks like the back streets of London at thetime not the sort of place you would find a wealthy trader in Amsterdamliving at. But all that would be just a blemish on a otherwise averagemovie. The main problem I have with the movie is that a very importantand by the clothing and position obviously wealthy man is depicted as aman of color. Please bear in mind we are talking about 1636 - 1637mainland Europe... There certainly where man of color but mostcertainly not in positions like that this is before the slave trade hadwell and truly started and +200 years before it ended. If you aremaking a historical movie make it historically accurate. Just imaginethe outrage if a movie about the rise and fall of the Zulu nation wasmade and a person of influence and power within the tribe would beplayed by a white man...The ridiculous distortion of history in this movie is what earns it itslow score, the movie itself is not very engaging and would not havescored higher than 6 stars.
