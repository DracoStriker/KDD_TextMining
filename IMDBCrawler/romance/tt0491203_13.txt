This film has probably one of the worst silly scripts imaginable. Noteven the stellar cast could make it have a decent success. Maybe itwill do well in the rental market but wow... what a disaster.The mixing of so many stories along with unthinkable plots. Yes, theobvious orphan ends up falling in love with the painter almost worksbut the hard part.. spoiler.. is that she pretends to have a baby thatreally belongs to the maid. What a stupid idea only hollyweird wouldconceive as plausible. And to add insult to injury, the plots all end in a terrible dreadfulending only to be saved again at the end.. a nice Hollywood happyending for everyone. Just dreadful and bombed at the box office withgood reason Save your money and wait for it on netflixs... I give it a3 for the actors. and 0 for the writers. Maybe it is appropriate sincethis is also the ending of Harvey Weinstein era.... A Tulip Fever ofSexual Fever.
