Many have slammed this film as being bad or "wilted" as one said. But Isee it as just a enjoyable chick flick. As a big fan of Alicia Vikander and Jack O'Connell I have been waitingfor the release. Judy Dench and Christof Waltz were added charm. Dean Dehaan was ill casted but I never thought he had the chopsanyways.Holliday Granger loses out on upper billing where she should have been.Cara Devaingne shouldn't have ever been allowed to leave the runway.Zack Galafinacas, held up the idiot jester of the film with his littleslice of comedy. All in all a sweet, funny, goofy and awkward little story. Straight tovideo if anything, not worthy of a theater release. Only the names init will bring people to the theater.I had a good time watching and isn't that what a movie really is, justa good way to pass the time.
