Tulip Fever felt like modern Shakespeare, ironic tragedies fill theplot laced with wit and humor. The film hardly takes time to meander,moving like a whip through the streets of 17th century Amsterdam andplot line point by point, quick enough to entertain as not to bore. Itwas beautifully shot and the cast showed up to work, with ChristopherWaltz and Alicia Vikander really shining. If you're a fan of periodpieces and smart humor, you'll like this one! If you're in for a bit ofromance there's some of that for you too, or if you want to see AliciaVikander prove once again why she's an Oscar winning actress, the movieis worth a viewing.
