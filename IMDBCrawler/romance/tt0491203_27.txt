Quite confusing at first who the story was really about, since thenarrator Mary is the house made and focuses on the story from her pointof view but the camera focuses on Sophia. But then I realized that Iactually enjoy it that was, it's like that in reality also. Where weare the story teller but someone else is the center of attention. And Ithink it quite worked since the story then ended with Mary gettingeverything she had dreamed of. Cornelius and Sophia are quite an oddcouple. Cornelius a lot older, knowing what he wants, and Sophia a lotyounger not knowing what she wants, until one day when Cornelius asksan artist to do their portrait. A young man doing what he loves, butnot so good at business. Jan Van Loos and Sophia is more of a match andthey too realize that and fall in love, but they hide their affairgood, only Mary finds out. Cornelius wants a heir. A son to take overeverything when he dies. But they can't get a child, the reason forthat is unclear. The point of no return is when Mary reveals that sheis pregnant, she knows that a pregnant house made would get fired, soshe uses Sophias secret as leverage to stay. Sophia then comes up withthe idea to fake her pregnancy and say that the child Mary is givingbirth to is Cornelius and hers. And this is when more people getinvolved to cover up their secret. In the meanwhile Jan Van Loos getsinto the Tulip trade business, to earn enough money for him and Sophiato escape the country. The plan is bullet proof, but in the end Sophiarealizes her mistake, and I believe she realizes she actually lovesCornelius too, so instead she disappear. Cornelius finds out abouteverything, but instead of getting upset and angry he leaves everythingto Mary, her newborn child and her lover and leaves the country tostart a new life abroad. I really enjoyed it, the story felt new and original. It gave me thatfairy tale feeling, not childish but for grownups. Plus I like thehidden comedy in it, a lot of times where I started laughing.
