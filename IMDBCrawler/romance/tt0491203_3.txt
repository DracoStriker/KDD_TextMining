On one hand - too many story lines ,which are also hard to follow, asthe characters look and dress so alike! As often happens when you getto many story lines, the one that should have been the principal line -In this case' in my opinion,the one of the tulip bubble - is given toolittle emphasis. The miniscule roll given to judy dench will not allowher to show even a bit of her acting capabilities. shame.
