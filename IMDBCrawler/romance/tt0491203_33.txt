It's not often that a historical fictional work has a good plot thatcomes together and has a feelgood ending, so I was pleasantlysurprised. The way things came together and worked out was quiteclever. The Vermeer like interiors and costumes are quite admirable asis the attention to detail.There are a couple of faults with the production. The sets were crowdedand too slum like - could have been prettier. How about some prettytulip fields? Some scenes were too chaotic and there was too muchrunning around. The tulip market bubble was too frenzied to be clear.Quite an impressive cast list but there are some casting faults andsuccesses. Holliday Grainger is for once suited to the role - her plumpcheeks really make her right for the role of Dutch maid. AliciaVikander on the other hand seemed too dark complexioned and thin to bea Dutch woman from that time. Not suited for the role. Dane DeHaan istoo sickly and weak looking to inspire such a passion. Why he was castas a romantic lead baffles. Christoph Waltz is even more masculinelooking than him.Worth a watch for the good story.
