Hi everyone. I watched Tulip Fever yesterday. I wanted to see thisfilm, because it has an excellent cast. Just take a look at this list:Alicia Vikander, Christoph Waltz, Judi Dench, Jack O'Connell and etc.Although I'm not a fan of this genre (Romance, Drama). This picturetell us about tulip fever int 17th century in Netherlands. It is thefirst story line. The second story line is a love story of one family.And of course these two stories overlap. This is the main plot of thefilm. During the film, the main characters will make difficult lifedecisions. But this is not a love story like Woody Allen's. The storyhas several interesting plot twists. But I think that if you've seenmany romance films, for you it will be predictable twists.Well, now what I liked: 1) The production designer has created greatcostumes (you can see them in the scene when Alicia Vicander comes tothe market and we see a contrast between the rich and the poor) 2)Justin Chadwick ambiguously show us tulip fever (love fever and tulipfever). This intrigues the viewerAnd some disadvantages: 1) I was disappointed, when i see the play ofactors. Only Alicia Vicander and Christophe Waltz really played well,and the viewer can only empathize with them.As for me, I liked this movie, although I'm not a fan of this genre.Finally, I can recommend Tulip Fever everyone who wants to getacquainted with costume dramas.
