I really enjoyed this movie. I admit it. And the main reason for thisis the perfectly edited trailer. It deceives you, in purpose... You areprepared to see an evil old man to torture his wife, and hunt down theyoung lovers, isn't so? At the trailer every phrase of Chris Waltz, isso beautifully cut, to give him as the evil one... You start to watchthe film in a mood and in the course you realize the deception. Waltzis nice, careful, sweet, ready to forgive everyone except himself. Youhear the same phrases in whole this time and the meaning of them istotally changed , no harm at all... On the contrary Alicia, proved tobe such a devil! You trusted her sweet face from the beginning andsuddenly you feel so fool as her husband did... What a slut! A viciousplan from such a beauty. She makes her sins, she grabs babies, sheplays the dead... She changes her mind, she spit out an... Amen, andshe goes back to play this time whom? Lazarus? The woman is simply a...Goddess!!! No surprise that she ends as a nun. Evil one, but nun!Really enjoyable plot, really nice choice of actors, first time that atrailer works out as essential part of the movie...
