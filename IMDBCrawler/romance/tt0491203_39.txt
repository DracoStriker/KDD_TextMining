. . . when you can have a wench with two lips fever? This TULIP FEVERstrumpet eventually gets herself back to the nunnery, which has beenthe hottest cinema sex spot since the days of CAMELOT and THE DEVILS.As SPOTLIGHT documented a few years ago when it earned the "BestPicture" Oscar, the world would be a whole lot better off if the RomanFathers confined themselves to the domiciles of the Holy Mothers,keeping all of their Rain Dear Games in-house, so to speak. If all ofthese black-clad mischief-makers (who are featured creating andmanipulating a "Bubble Market" in tulip bulbs during TULIP FEVER) couldbe sequestered in their mountain-top "retreats" for All Eternity andthen some, the world-wide incidence of child-rape, forcible oral sex,and Sodomite assaults could be cut by at least two-thirds. Once theseSuperstitious Types remove themselves from the Real World in TULIPFEVER, everyone else lives Happily Ever After.
