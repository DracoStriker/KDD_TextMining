Kate Winslett's performance as Hanna makes this film a memorableexperience. Her vacant stares are anything but vacant and will hauntyou long after you have left the theater. The subject matter is muchmore than just an affair with an older woman, albeit this love affairimpacts the young man throughout his life. It is more a morality playand a philosophical question of German guilt.Bruno Ganz, who plays the professor, actually includes Karl Jaspers'The Question of German Guilt as required reading for his young lawstudents, including Michael Berg, Hanna's lover. The professor alsorequires his young law students to attend a trial for low level guardsfrom the concentration camps.While watching the trial scenes, I tried to make a decision as to whatI would have done if I were in Berg's position. It is not an easyquestion. I guarantee you will be torn apart by this film.The young Michael Berg, David Kross, gives a stunning performance. AndRalph Fiennes, as usual, gives the performance he should, reserved, yetmulti-layered if you look deep into the philosophical questions thisfilm poses.It is based on a book by Bernhard Schlick, adapted for the screen byDavid Hare, and directed by Stephen Daltry. I highly recommend thisfilm.One last thing, on a personal note, I fell in love with Bruno Ganz inthe Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire and I am still in love with thatman. So sexy.
