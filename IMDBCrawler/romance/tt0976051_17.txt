I read the book this movie is based on about 10 years ago, and as Iwatched the movie, it came back to me. I am not a Nazi sympathizer -very much NOT so - but at one point during the trials when KateWinslet's character (Hanna) asks the judge, "what would you have done"kind of sums it up a lot. By reading the book beforehand, there is alot more insight that perhaps the movie doesn't clearly give. From thebeginning in the book it seems obvious that Hanna is illiterate and solater she on more apparent that she could never have possibly writtenthe reports she was accused of. Why she allowed it to happen that she got put in prison, one does notreally know. Was it to help with the guilt she felt for what she knewshe had done even if she did not write the reports? Whether this story is really true or not, it's an interesting look onthe other side to the Holocaust. Hitler did not just enact a hugeamount of genocide, he also brainwashed even his own to a certain*ideal* and it was an obey or be killed. Orwell's 1984 is a fantasizedyet so true of this way of thinking. Please read the literature and books and everything you can find on theHolocaust. The brilliant minds we lost during that time will never berecovered.
