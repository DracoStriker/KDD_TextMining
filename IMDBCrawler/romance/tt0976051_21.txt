In less than a decade,director Stephen Daldry has built a careercomposed by movies which have been highly acclaimed.Billy Elliot,TheHours and now The Reader,combine good manufacture with mature stories.Ihave to say I did not like Billy Elliot and The Hours very muchbecause,although I appreciated those two elements I mentioned,I hadfound them too forced on their attempt at being commercial,not tomention I had also found them to be a little bit boring.I think thatwith The Reader,Daldry has made his best movie so far.At the differenceof his previous films,The Reader never feels forced and I had afascinating experience while watching it.Let's see why.The "forbiddenromance",which pushes the conflict of this movie,is interesting but notparticularly meaningful.The ideological background from the story ismuch more provocative,because it shows the causes and consequences ofbad decisions which seemed appropriate on a moment.Many people havecriticized The Reader because of its apparent apology of Nazi warcriminals but I think they took the wrong focus.The Reader is notinterested in analyzing their objective innocence or guilt,but onshowing how a normal and reasonable person could commit atrocitiesduring wartime,without being the amoral monster which immediately comesto our minds.That ideological and emotional audacity is the bestelement from this movie,because it results absolutelyfascinating.Besides,the excellent performances from Kate Winslet andDavid Kross help to this movie.They are 100% natural on every scenethey appear.Ralph Fiennes brings a competent performance,but this movieclearly rests on Winslet's and Kross' shoulders,whose extraordinaryworks are completely deserving of applause.Some people may complainabout the slow tone from this movie,but I do not,because theparsimonious development is essential for showing the characters'evolution and for completely involving us into the movie.The only thingI can say against this brilliant movie is that the ending feels alittle bit convenient and manipulative.But,in sight of all the positiveelements this movie brings,I can excuse that fail.The Reader is anexcellent film which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation.Ialways admire when a movie wants to leave us thinking,and that's themain reason why I liked The Reader so much.
