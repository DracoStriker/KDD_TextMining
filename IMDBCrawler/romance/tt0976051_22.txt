I have been meaning to watch this movie for quite some time now and oneday I sat down and watched. I was not disappointed. Quite the opposite;I was surprised and it was absolutely wonderful. One of the mostmeaningful movies that I have ever seen. The portrayals of thesecharacters are spectacular. I must say, although I have not read thebook, I can still have a critical eye upon the movie. As many of KateWinslet's movies; this one is strong and once again you are surprisedby the choice of role she has chosen. The newest star, David Kross isabsolutely superb in his role. He follows it through with such passionand emotion that it is clear that he will be a great star in the nearfuture. The lack of media and focus on him, I think, is a shame. He wasfantastic and in my opinion, he deserves and academy award as much asthe rest of all other nominees . I do recommend this movie to people. It's phenomenal and if you give ita chance, you might think so to.
