Good film about the relationship of a young man who meets an olderwoman with whom he has an affair, little suspecting her past or how itwould effect the rest of his life. Multi-Oscar nominated film is a goodlittle drama, but one that has left me scratching my head as to it'sbest picture nomination.(Equally bizarre is Kate Winslett's GoldenGlobe win as a supporting actress when she's on screen a large chunk ofthe film) While I do like the film, I don't love it. I found it oftenas distant as the lead male character becomes. For me the problem thatDavid Hare's script often reduces the inner conflict of the hero byhaving him speak not from the heart but the head. Basically, the dialogis much too clunky and it under cuts much of the rest of the emotion.Its not one of David Hare's better works (I'm a huge Hare fan andrarely has his dialog ever just sort of laid there like a dry textbook). Its a good film and I do recommend it, but as as best picturecontender I would discount it as not quite in the league of the otherfour nominees. (I'd give Winslet the edge on best actress)
