Extremely disappointing post-World War 11 film in Germany. A totallyundeserved Oscar win for Kate Winslet. She, as others in the past, gotthe compensation award for previously losing the coveted award. Surely,Meryl Streep in "Doubt," and Ann Hathaway in "Rachel Getting Married"gave far better performances.As for this movie, most of the story could have been told in 40 minutesor so. The best line of the movie in my opinion was that Jewish peopledon't have to worry about illiteracy. How true that is.Winslet was often droll here. I expected her to breakout at some pointbut that never occurred. The prosecuting attorney was without emotionhere. Remember Max Schell in that kind of role in "Judgment atNuremberg?" David Kross deserves acting kudos for his role as the young man caughtup in a sexual romp with Hannah Schmitz, (Winslet)Both Kross and an older Ralph Fiennes play the role of Michael Berg. Iwas expecting to hear at some point that Berg was Jewish. After all, itis a Jewish name.While it is true that their romance took place over one summer, thefilm is missing a steaminess. When he discovers what Hannah has done,Cross keeps his head down as if he is ashamed to have been associatedwith her. After all, he never visited her in prison.Let us never try to make Hannah a compassionate person because she wasilliterate. As the Nazi guard, she knew exactly what she was doing inthe selection process. In addition, this illiterate had her victimsread to her before they met their cruel fate. Was she trying to exploither young lover in the same way?
