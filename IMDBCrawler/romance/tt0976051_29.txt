It's not really difficult to be complimentary about this movie.Wonderful direction, quietly engrossing, great performances from all.Nice to see Bruno Ganz turning up too. There is something amazing abouta film which successfully spreads itself across decades of people'slives, and this film is certainly successful in that respect. Reallymakes you think about the roles we play as humans. Are they really ofour own making? How much power do we truly have in terms of beingcaught up something much, much bigger than one can even imagine?Probably the best thing that Ralph Fiennes has done in a while; KateWinslet's star is obviously very much in the ascendancy these days, andI hope that we will be seeing a lot more of David Kross - a fine youngactor.
