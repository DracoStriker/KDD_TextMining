Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that isalmost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an olderwoman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her warcrimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happyjaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressingstory. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developedinto an an outstanding actress.The second part is what most people, I assume, will remember about thisfilm. Can "Hanna Schmitz," a Nazi employee (so to speak), who was partof concentration camps, be a sympathetic character? To me, that's whatit looked like that's the question the story was asking. The answer mayhave come in the final minutes of the movie when her ex-lover "MichaelBerg," now grown up and played by Ralph Fiennes, confronts a survivorof the camp. That, too, was very intense and interesting scene. LenaOlin is riveting as "Rose/Illana Mather." "The Reader" was full of quiet, but intense scenes. This is a verythought-provoking film, especially for one that doesn't start off thatway but look almost like some soft-porn flick to get our attention. Itis anything but that.For Germans, this film must bring out many emotions and thoughts. Guiltand forgiveness are just two of the issues that are dealt with in thisunique film. "Hanna Schmitz" turns out to be an incrediblysimple-yet-complex person, unlike any I've encountered on film in along time. You see her in all kinds of light, both good and bad.Kudos, too, to David Kross' acting as the young Michael Berg. It mustbe strange for someone his age (barely turned 18) to do the scenes hedid with 30-something Winslet.Overall, a very different and excellent film that stays with you andmakes you ponder its main characters.
