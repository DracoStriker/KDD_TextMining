I've read several places on the internet that many found 'The Reader'to be slow-paced and relatively boring at times. I didn't find itboring for a single second, it's a very interesting film about theHolocaust aftermath in Germany. Surely the film would have had extraaffection if the characters had spoken in the German language, but theperformances are all around so good that I quickly forgave them formaking Bruno Ganz speaking English. Anyhow, Stephen Daldry does haveproblems keeping a film spanning from the mid 50ties to the mid 90tieswell constructed all the way through, there are a couple of missteps(as what's actually the thing between Michael (David Kross/RalphFiennes) and his family?) but in retrospect it's Kate Winslet's fineperformance and the odd romantic situation that lingers. Great workfrom cinematography and production design captures the time-travelingwith great visuals.
