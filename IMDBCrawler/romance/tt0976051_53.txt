I have heard the first half of 'The Reader' was misunderstood inrelation to the second half, or overall story. I also felt the same wayduring act one. In fact, it was hard to look past the numerous sexscenes and full frontal nudity from both male and female. But, alas, Ibelieve it all came together to fully show how completely messed upthis woman, Hanna, (Kate Winslet) made Michael's (Ralph Fiennes) life.What's odd, and is very little attention is paid to the (no spoilerhere) pedophile Hanna is. We definitely live in a very contradictorysociety when it comes to sexuality. It's generally okay for two womento be in a relationship (and usually rooted on,) but it's anabomination for two men and it's a mortal sin for an adult male to havesexual relations with an under-aged female (or male) but it's barelyeven mentioned ? or poked fun at ? if it's an adult female with a boy.I will probably never understand this and it's relevant in this filmas, if it's mentioned, it's hardly an issue when Hanna seduces andsteals Michael's youth ? and eventual life. Overall, it's a beautiful,if disturbing, film, with great performances from Fiennes anddefinitely Winslet. Not to try and reveal anything, she is truly amonster, and Winslet deserves an Oscar (and Globe) for such a powerfullook into her demon she seems fine with sweeping under the carpet.Young Michael, (David Kross) the victim (in more ways than one) seemedto try his best; I give him kudos for effort and the ability to bearall. Little can be said about the plot, without spoilers, but it'sdefinitely a must-see film about potential war crimes, and the victimsthat stack up. Even when the war's over.
