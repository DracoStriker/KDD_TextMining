The reader more or less took me by surprise. And not just a little bit.I just saw it and i am almost speechless.OK, i cried several times.And yes i love Kate Winslet.Im still a bit emotional but ill try to be rational.The Reader is a love story. A love story against maybe the most grimcircumstances it can be in. Or end up i should say, cause the firsthalf of the movie takes up the character building, the evolving of thelove. There is quite some nudity in that part, but i didn't find it outof place. It's supporting to the love, as it should be.The acting is great, specially Kate with her beautiful facialexpression. It's never boring. It just took me and dragged me in moreand more. It ends in a secret that is not to be told. While Kate akaSarah finds herself in a difficult position. It turns into a moralitymovie, while the love keeps into the story, adding to the tension.This is the first movie i have seen that portrays the people that wereactually camp guards in WW2, as human beings that thought they didright. It's not all black and white as we are so desperately willing tosee it. (B & W... ?) Im sorry, i can write a whole book about this, but whats the use?We will make the same mistakes. Over and over and over.You have to see this movie.I would have given it a 13, but ...Im still speechless i guessReally, i don't know what to say
