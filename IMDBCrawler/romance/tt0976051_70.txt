David Kross promises to be a young talent that is waiting to explode infilms, and his role in THE READER is a mesmerizing and stunning rolefor a young man who learned English in order to play in the film. Krossand Winslet are glorious in scenes which are both of a tender nature,and at times frightening with the intensity of two tigers waiting toclaw one another. The film is beautifully shot, locations are incomplete relation to the story, and watching the face of David Krosslook at Winslet is a treasure to behold. Stephen Daldry has directed animmensely important film of human flaws, coupled with the history ofWorld War II Germany, and Kate Winslet better take the Globe and Oscarhome for THE READER.
