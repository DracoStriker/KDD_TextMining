David Hare wrote one of my favorite female characters in "Plenty",Meryl Streep brought her to life in the most extraordinary way. Here,Hare writes another power house female character. It doesn't have theintellectual aspirations of "Plenty" but there is also a form of mentalillness in his character. Kate Winslet is magnificent. Her early sceneswith the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling,contradictory and totally believable undertones. My misgivings are tobe pinned on Stephen Daldry, the director. His sins as a filmmakerstart to become a sort of trade mark, visible and palpable in themoving "Billy Elliot" and the shattering "The Hours" I can't quitepinpoint what it is but in "The Reader" that element is more obviousthan in the other two. Maybe it has to do with loftiness. There aremoments so frustratingly long and slow here that he lost me in morethan one occasion. In any case, the cast makes this film a rewardingexperience. Besides Kate Winslet and David Kross. The tortured RalphFinnes has a couple of wonderful moments as well as Bruno Ganz and LinaOlin in a dual role.
