The Reader is a movie that contains many emotional alternations andthat is something that the viewers like it in such a film. It's a moviethat the base backdrop is World War II and the relationship betweenHanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and Michael Berg (David Kross - RalphFiennes).I liked this movie because it combines very nice love with war althougha lot of people say that it may in some places be monotonic and tediousbut I do not think so. It should be noted that it is based on the novel"Der Vorleser" from Bernhard Schlink.As a conclusion I would like to tell you that I recommend it because Ithink that it will "touch" you.
