A powerful and, dare I say, moving story of a boy's coming of age andfirst sexual and romantic involvement with an older woman. Set inGermany, the film moves between 1950s and the 1990s. A young man,Michael Berg (played by David Cross) reads voraciously to the woman ofhis obsession, Hanna Schmitz, (played by Kate Winslet), in between lotsof sex, and awakens in her a love of the written word; she however isilliterate. After her abrupt and unexplained departure, Michael isforced to get on with his life. Some years later, as a law student (nowplayed by Ralph Fiennes), he sits in on a trial of Nazi guards, one ofwhom is Hanna Schmitdz, the woman he met at 15. She is one of a groupof 6 ex Auschwitz guards trying to defend themselves against heinouswar crimes. Michael is shocked and disgusted to see his former lover insuch a setting and, even though he holds the knowledge that couldabsolve her, remains mute throughout the proceedings. Consequently,Hannah is sentenced to 20 years in prison. At some point during herincarceration, Michael begins to send her tapes of stories he used toread her. This brings some light into her life and eventually sheteaches herself to read. At the end of her sentence, Michael is theonly 'friend' Hannah has and is summoned to help her when she isreleased. He is prepared to sort out the practicalities she will needfor life on the outside but his resentment prevents any furtherkindness or involvement. The story does not have a happy ending butMichael tells Hannah's story to his daughter which serves as acathartic process for both of them. The movie was well done and I likedthe fact that is wasn't obvious in its themes.
