I can see that I am not the only person who missed this excellent dramaupon first release, and in fact I actually avoided it at the time, notbothering. Friends raved about it and I was ho-hum. Now I wish I hadseen the film in a cinema, given it's potent impact even through thehell of watching THE READER on commercial clogged Television. A revisiton DVD is now a must. Similar in structure to SOPHIE'S CHOICE anotherWW2 aftermath moral dilemma with time shifts and character revelations,THE READER is a completely absorbing and thrilling drama with superbcasting and excellent production values. Made on a modest budget andwith new comer David Kross' pivotal performance as the teen in lovewith older woman with a vile past (Kate Winslet) THE READER establishesitself strongly with a heady mix of sex and secrets. The scenes at thelake with his teen friends realising he is up to something are alsoevocative. A similar but more ghastly film was the 1971 film THE NIGHTPORTER with a role reversal and disgusting fetish. If you see it youcan see the identity swap and the cruelty of attraction. THE READER hasa sunny lead teen and a cold femme balance. The moral dilemma is not tobe revealed but witnessed as you see the film for the first time.
