The Plot: A teenage boy finds himself in a (sexual) relation with anolder woman. Part of their relation is based on the boy reading to theolder woman. However one day the woman disappears, leaving the teenageboy heartbroken.Several years later he finds her again as he witnesses (as a spectator)her trial where she is charged for war crimes.As society passes moral judgement over the woman, so does he. Whetherhe is right or wrong in doing so is left to the viewer to decide, themovie merely shows us what happens given the choices the charactersmade.The acting: Although I don't think anyone could've acted any betterthan Kate Winslet in this movie, speaking English with a German accentto portray Germans is very disappointing. However, the characters don'tspeak out every emotion they are experiencing (unlike most US of Amovies) which challenges the viewer to think for themselves, is itlove, fear, sense of duty, hate, misunderstanding, shame (and i couldgo on) that motivates the characters actions? Very difficult to pulloff, but all actors pull this off magnificently. They force you to lookat the complexities of a human being and (rightfully so) deny you theeasy way out by simply putting people in 'good' or ' bad' categoriesand be done with it. (Note: see those reviews that think bad of thismovie? Written by people who love doing this and find themselvesconfronted with their own shallow mind, better to disregard the moviethen!)To sum it up, a very nice thought provoking movie about morals andlove. Definitely worth a watch!
