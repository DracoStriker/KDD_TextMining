Tragic drama involving a young boy's first pure and long-lasting lovewith a woman. One of the most emotional drama films I have ever seen. A delicate story told in authentic environment of post-war Germanywhich is recreated in top style. The film shows how love changespeople, and therefore the audience is openly questioned what is a realpure love.This a very deep story with lots of unexpected turns, twists andsubplots. Story has one of the most dramatic turns I have ever seen.This allows us to understand better the human nature.The film provides another look at the bloody crimes committed duringWW2 by some Germans in the concentration camps. The movie brings up avery important question of what is guilt. This was Kate Winslet's the best movie so far. She was acting in anincredible way. It's not a surprise that she got Academy Award for thisas a best actress. The young German actor David Kross has also showedthat he is an immensely talented actor.The directing is wonderful. The screenplay is one of the best. All in all, the film is one best works of art I have ever seen with atouching story. It really deserves those nominations for AcademyAwards.
