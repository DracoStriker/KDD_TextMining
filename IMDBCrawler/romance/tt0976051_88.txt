Somewhere in the dark, amid the wet streets of Berlin, this storyarose. It was originally written by Bernhard Schlink, screen played byDavid Hare and later directed in a motion picture by Stephen Daldry.The story is of a young teenage boy named Michael Berg (David Kross)who is smitten by Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) an older neighbor andseduced into an assignation. Though their affair is the basis for theirinitial contact, Michael comes to enjoy the pleasant company of theolder woman who introduces him to youthful physical pleasure, but alsoto the mysterious side of a woman with a secret. It is this secretwhich the adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) must contend with. His olderlife revolves around their early companionship, one which ties theminexorably to the future. The forward and backward motion of the storyis difficult to come to grips with, but eventually the audience snaresthe essence of message. Mr. Fiennes is superb as Michael and comes torealize there is so much hatred between the races, it could easily keeptheme apart for eternity. The movie is incredible, the cast whichincludes Bruno Ganz as Professor Rohl, is superior and the result is abasis for a Classic and after viewing the film, would not be surprised.****
