Catherine Hardwicke, please put the camera down. You have absolutely notalent and yes, it does bother me that your daughter does get intoevery movie you direct. This could've been the greatest film of 2008but your filthy little hands seem to have gotten on my favorite author.First of all, why in the world is Bella as pale as the vampires? I getthat she doesn't tan, but she does still have a pulse according to thebook. (Maybe you should read it. I mean, it is just based on thewritten version of Twilight.) I felt as if I had not read the book, Iwould have no idea what was going on in the movie, which in my opinion,isn't how a movie should present itself. UGH! GET ME A NEW DIRECTOR!!!
