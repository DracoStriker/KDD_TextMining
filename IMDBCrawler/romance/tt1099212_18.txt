These really aren't vampires. I mean they're emo boys with 'powder puffgirl' power. Warning, if you aren't a 12 year old girl (My femalestudents are 15-16 and they never even read the book because they saidit was for children) so if you're not a tweener who has read the bookand loved it, there is no reason for you to spend money to watch thismovie.Everything that legend has created for the vampire is thrown out thedoor. What's new? Or changes? vampires glisten in the sun, they havelong doe-eyed stares, play baseball and only drink the blood of poordefenseless animals.Even having said all of this, I wish there had been more atmosphere, astory that was creepy or haunting, instead the lead characters juststare at each other. Neither is particularly attractive, and when Iread that a shirtless scene for the male star was pulled because (selfadmitted by the way) he didn't look good, well that compounded with thepasty make-up and sullen behavior makes this kind of a poor man'sBuffy. Oh, and the action (what little there is) is weird, and cheaplydone, in fact all the F/X are lame.Oh, and the 'bad' vampires come in and then promptly disappear withoutbecoming a part of the story... like the attempt at the werewolf thing. I am sure the girly girls that read the book will be happy and that's agood thing, but the rest of us can go see Bolt and get a chuckle or tooor rent a real vampire movie.
