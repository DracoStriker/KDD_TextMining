This movie is simply awful! I don't hate it because it's a chick flick.I hate it because the acting was so awful, i just wanted to scream atthe television!The story was so incredibly bad! There is no character's development, and the characters are so bad! This movie is a disgrace for vampires!Are vampires vegetarian? Do vampires go out while it's sun outside? Arethey supposed to sparkle? Are vampires supposed to be driving andwearing sunglasses? No, they're are not supposed to drive and vampiresdo not wear sunglasses, because they're not supposed to be outside on asunny day! Do vampires eat animal blood instead of human blood? And dothey have souls? NO!!I gave this movie 1/10 because I enjoyed the cinematography!This movie is a great example of a bad movie!
