I have never read any of the books before in my life. I have heard mostof my information about Twilight from my friends who have summarizedthe books for me so I knew what was going on before I saw the movie.While I was watching it the first time, I thought it was great. Ilaughed at some of the parts a couple of times...such as the facialexpressions on Edwards face, some of the cheesy lines, and theinteresting choice of visual effects. But overall, it was great.That was only the first time I saw it.I then read the book and began comparing the movie to the book. It wasamazing how absolutely wrong I was about the movie. The book sort ofcompleted everything and pulled all the pieces and emotions together. Ithen went to go see the movie once more with a die hard fan of theseries and almost felt embarrassed at the fact that I had told her onlya week before how amazing the movie was! I really did feel ashamed forwhat I had said and sure enough, she was completely disappointed and Ifelt like I didn't do my job at warning her before we saw it.We both agree: the visual effects and the poor writing were the biggestdownfalls of the movie. I almost want to cry because I feel so bad forthe author of the books and also for the die hard fans. I think my 7year old cousin could write a better script and make better visualeffects.I really hope they decide to take their time on the sequels and do itright. I heard that they fired the director? I hope so! That would bethe only way you could get me to see the following movies...consideringI will be reading the rest of the books within that time!
