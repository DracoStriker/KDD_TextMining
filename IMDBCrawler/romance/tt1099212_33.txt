Boring, Slow & Cheesy...... This movie had woman written all over it.It was slow moving, not scary, not mysterious and most definitely notsexy. Surely vampires should be all of those things. This book isdisrespectful toward all literary traditions created by classicalGothic and horror writers. Vampires burn in the sunlight, don't they? Or are all of the movies andbooks I've read wrong?. Obviously Miss Meyer disagrees with those booksand thinks that vampires 'sparkle' in the sunlight. I mean wtf. The book and movie were clearly written for young girls (fan girls),that like things such as Camp Rock and the Jonas Brothers. The overromanticising of every little detail is sickening. What has happened toreal horror stories and classic movies such as Terence Fisher's Dracula(starring Christopher Lee)?Twilight could have been an amazing and successful production, if ithad a good director and a good cast. The book had an OK storyline-apart from the sparkling in the sun. The vampires have no weakness,every good hero has a weakness- but this was clearly only made for thefan girls.It doesn't deserve the one star that i gave it, but there is no optionto give it 0 unfortunately.This movie is a disgrace, an utter waste of time and an insult to allthe vampires out there ;)
