This is one of those cases where the movie is better than the book, andthough that sounds good,its not saying much. Even so, the movie isabsolutely horrible. Moments that looked rather like the directordidn't even take the movie seriously himself- when Bella first sitsnext to Edward is one- and bad acting cannot make up for a bland, andas others have said, predictable story. If one were to have just seenthe movie,I'm sure there were many plot holes as well, like WHY theblack vampire was traveling with two such dangerous vampires in thefirst place, and if he did know why did he not join them. This movieisn't worth the money I spent, much less going to the midnight showing-though I must admit when the movie started going backwards and upsidedown, it was pretty good. What? That wasn't part of the movie? Just atechnical error? Dang, then this movie has no entertainment value.Also, to the girl two rows down from me in the theater, this movie, norits book counterweight, are not even close to being compared to TheLord of The Rings.
