Horrible adaptation, cheesy stunts, CGI. Horrible acting, directing,screen play. This is the most destructive force ever done to a book.Stephenie should take her books from Summit Entertainment and sell themto someone else. How could they destroy such a great book thisway!!!!Any true Twilight fan who thought that the movie was good mustnot really get the books. So disappointed. Edward was nothing like thebook, the acting did not even come close to what was displayed in thebooks. When could not hear inside Edward's mind. Jacob's wig washorrible. We never heard anything about Jasper and his powers. The bestscene in the movie was the baseball game, but that was cheesy too.
