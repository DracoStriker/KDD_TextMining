I would give this movie no stars.. This movie is pathetic. I mean sopathetic. The acting was awful! The movie starts well, but once they introduce the Cullens its prettymuch downhill. Ashley Greene looks good as Alice, Jackson Rathbonelooks constipated as Jasper, a wooden plank would have been a moreconvincing Edward. Robert Pattinson deserves the Razzie, secondthought, his acting is so horrible that a razzie is like honoring him. Vampires are supposed to be scary, when Edward scales trees he actslike a monkey, move over Kong! The baseball match looks like SuperMario Sluggers on steroids! Horrible..The scene where Edward glitters is pathetic. It looks someone dumpedsome glitter on him.. On the other hand Charlie Swan and Jacob were spot on.Over all the director tried too hard and lost it all. I stronglybelieve someone with more experience should direct a high profile filmlike this. This movie doesn't appeal as a Vampire movie or as aRomantic movie. Its pathetic.. Jury
