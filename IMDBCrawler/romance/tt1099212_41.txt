Being a huge fan of the Twilight series from the beginning, I am morethen perturbed by the movie attempt. It was, for lack of a better wordincomprehensible. So many little minute details were left out that wereso much a part of the story line and that is a HUGE disappointment towatch?. I can understand that it is not always easy to incorporateevery detail from a book to a movie but the little deviations stolefrom the story.I have always pictured Bella as a shy, sweet girl with a naive air toher and this was not portrayed in the movie. I did not find the Bellain the movie to have even a remote resemblance in personality to theBella (that I know and love) in the book. I feel the movie was basedtoo loosely on the book and anyone who did not first read the storywould not understand some of the feeble attempts that were portrayed(the lullaby for example) in the movie. If you had not read, the bookyou would not understand that Edward actually wrote that Lullaby forBella it would just appear that he was playing a song on the piano forher. How about the Sadie Hawkins Dance that was cut entirely and whileit would seem not a big deal that is what leads up to the revealing ofEdward in the sunlight. Or when he stopped the van Edward runs awaywhen he was supposed to stay with her and have that little conversationabout how he had gotten there so fast and the stopping of the van withhis hand. I was extremely excited for this movie considering that Ihave read this series about a dozen times but what a let down and adisappointment it turned out to be. It makes me cringe to think whatNew Moon is going to be like. In a story such as this, you really haveto stick to the actual book as much as possible to get your viewers tosee and understand the characters their flaws and the underlyinghesitation, danger and love that encircles them all.
