Some movies are so good that they are talked about, often quoted andthought of almost with reverence decades after their first release.Twilight is not one of those movies. Twilight is fluff, utterlyforgettable, and gives cause to wonder why anyone would want to makethis movie in the first place. This movie is so nondescript and sodevoid of anything that is even remotely interesting that calling it abad movie would give it too much credit. In times past this movie wouldhave been assigned to the B portion of a double feature and be givenlittle if any notice. The story contains certain interesting featuresbut at no time does it make any dramatic impact worth noting. The moviemay work as escapist fare if you feel like going to the movies to takea nap, but given the high price of tickets today, that is not anadvisable option. So if you feel like taking a nap, go watch this moviewhen it comes out on a DVD or better yet when it is shown on networktelevision at which time you can start watching it and then go to sleepin the comfort of your own home.
