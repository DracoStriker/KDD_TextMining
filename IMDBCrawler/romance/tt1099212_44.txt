I couldn't wait to see my favorite book being brought to life on thebig screen and instead 'Twilight' was released, in no way did itrepresent the book, it was an extremely disappointing movie.I appreciate this was a low budget film but come on..... the only way Iknew the plot to this story was because I've read the book, if I hadn'thave, I wouldn't have had a clue what this film was about, it felt likeI was watching trailers not a movie.The Cullen's except for maybe Alice and Emmet were all completelywrong, as was Jake and his friends. What was with Jake's hair? Youcould tell it was false. James was like I imagined, however I thoughtVictoria had red hair? as for Edward Cullen he was descried as angeliclooking, very well turned out wearing designer clothes, graceful andpolite and he was none of the above, in fact he was quite the oppositeall of the Cullen's were, none of them had the right actions or looks,and why was Bella so miserable and moody she didn't came across thatway in the book.This movie and any others after will only be famous because of thebooks, and if the first movie Twilight is anything to go by the restare going to be just as bad if not worse, if they insist on making anymore movies then will someone please read the books and interpret thecharacters, scenes, actions everything correctly before putting usthrough another bad film, at least that way something good might beproduced and worthy to watch.I would recommend the books to anyone but I definitely tell them tostay well clear of the film/s.
