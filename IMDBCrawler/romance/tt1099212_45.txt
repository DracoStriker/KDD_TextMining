Never before have I been tempted to rip off my face and throw it at theTV screen just so I didn't have to watch anymore. Not only was this THEworst Vampire film I have ever seen, but it was also one of the worstfilms ever. It is quite clearly Vampires for Disney, or rather Vampiresfor barely pubescent girls. I am actually getting really angry justwriting this, for a start forget all the well known Vampire folklore,that goes right out the window. They can walk about in sunlight,crucifixes do nothing, they don't have fangs and they never sleep. Theycan however run very quickly and also fly without wings. If all thatdoesn't put you off they don't even kill humans, they just ponce aboutlooking like a load of pasty-faced EMO's (another group the film isclearly aimed at) keeping themselves to themselves. and that is it. forthe first hour and a half! then some proper Vampires turn up and theyrun away, then fight, then run some more, then fight the end. The lovestory is absolutely pathetic, she's new in town sits next to him inclass he seethes, he walks out. she doesn't see him for three weeks, heapologises, saves her from a crash and wham bam they're in love? It'smental. I don't care how hormonal she is. The way she figures out he'sa Vampire is so laughable I suggest you watch it on you tube, obviouslydon't watch the whole film or you may end up dead from boredom, justthat scene. Please please please don't watch this awful abomination ofa film. Watch The Lost Boys instead.
