Kristen Stewart was beyond horrible.The role of Bella was totally mis-cast, and that ruined the entiremovie! How can you miscast the main character? She's a lousy actress tosay the least.She put no emotion into her role.She STUNK! Additionally, the director didn't not put enough thoughtinto this movie.It was like he just tried to "hurry up" and get it into the theaters asquickly as possible.If he would have taken more time, made the movie a bit longer (only ifhe would have followed the book more closely), then, and maybe then, Iwould have given this movie a higher rating. But again, Kristen Stewarttotally ruined Bella. Instead of bringing her to life. She KILLED HERCOMPLETELY!
