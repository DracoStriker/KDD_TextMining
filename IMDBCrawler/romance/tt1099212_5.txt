I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the storywasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what'sgoing on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not ondialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.Surprisingly, Twilight wasn't that bad of a film. I expected it to bemuch worse. As I said, there's very little plot or dialog in the book,so it's hard to make a convincing film. They had to over act looks totry and communicate without many words. I could probably count on onehand the lines in the movie.Other than the over acting, it wasn't bad. There were some very goodmoments and some very "eh" moments. But overall I would recommend it toTwilight fans. I probably won't ever want to see it again, but it'sokay at midnight with some school friends who like it or something.
