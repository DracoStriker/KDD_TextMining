As a fan of the Twilight series, I really thought this could be aknock-out film. I am a Harry Potter fan and understand what a filmadaptation of a book series looks like. There are differences, but theessence is captured. I feel that the Twilight movie completely missedthe target. The heart of the book is the relationship between Edwardand Bella, and it was massacred. They were awkward and unnatural aroundeach other, and I blame it entirely on the production company anddirection. The characters couldn't have been more perfect, but thescript, special effects, and direction ruined it. The cheesiest lineswere pulled from the book and placed back to back so that nothing couldbe taken seriously. What a huge disappointment. I won't see it a secondtime if I can help it. I do hope that the second film is handed off toa studio with a larger budget and better vision.
