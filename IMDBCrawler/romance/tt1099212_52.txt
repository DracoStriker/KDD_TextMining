As much as I wanted to love this movie, it is an understatement to saythat i was extremely disappointed. I hated every last second of thismovie, the cast was almost entirely wrong, the music- terrible, eventhe way the movie was shot just made me want to cry. I am a die-hardfan of the books and the movie was a mockery of a masterpiece. Theaudience was laughing because it was so incredibly cheesy. The onlycommendable performance was given by Cam Gigandet who played James. Hislook was chilling and there was nothing cheesy or cliché about the wayhe portrayed this evil vampire. If you haven't seen the movie yet,spare yourself the $12.
