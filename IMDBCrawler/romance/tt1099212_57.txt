As a fan of the series I assumed it would at least SLIGHTY resemble thebook.. I guess I was wrong..Half of what when done was inaccurate and the other half was rushed..They took events that were supposed to "take place" over the course of6/7 months and packed then into a 2 hr movie that played out like itwas a week. Making the movie even more gag worthy.This was a great concept (in theory) but would have been SOOOOO muchbetter as a TV show. 1 book per season. AND WHO CAST THIS GARBAGE!!!..So i don't know what else to say other than I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!~ Disappointed in CT
