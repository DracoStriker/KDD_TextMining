Ah, where do you begin with something this awful? I have not read thebook, so this review is based solely on the merits of the movieitself...and it sucks. I've no doubt if I had read and liked the book,the movie would almost certainly be better even if it didn't live upthe expectation of the novel. That said, I never read Harry Potter,either, but enjoy all those films, so the filmmakers of Twilight musthave dropped the ball somewhere. I understand the girls think the guyis cute, but the rest of the story is beyond shallow. One of the othercomments summed it up perfectly when they asked how a 100+ year old man(in the body of a hot teen boy) finds his intellectual and emotionalequal in a 17 year old girl. And she doesn't have anything going forher. She's displaced trailer trash without much of a personality andonly modestly attractive. At least make her wicked smart, or have aglowing personality. Yawn. Not enough action, not enough cool vampirestuff, not enough of anything remotely interesting. All I can say isread the book, because the movie is beyond weak.
