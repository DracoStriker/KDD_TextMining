I respect that some people are trying to take this movie for what itis, and respect thistween-horror-vampire-romance-coming-of-age-angsty-drama slop-fest.But I can't. This movie gives up all character development, plotdevelopment, and pacing for about 2 hours of staring into the camerawith a perplexed yet upset look on a face, the most fairy-rific game ofbaseball ever, and about 15 seconds of what was supposed to be aClimactic Battle between good and evil, humanity and monstrosity, baseinstinct and morality.On top of all that, it also goes and takes they Vampire mythos, rapesit behind a Hot Topic, throws it some change and tells it to get itselfcleaned up, then hops in its Volvo and guns it back to Sillytown. Avampire with no weaknesses is not a vampire, it's ablood-sucking-super-powered demigod. And what would a demigod that hasno weaknesses and has apparently been around for centuries (if notmillennia) do with their great power? Apparently, move to WashingtonState, start a family and make sure your kids do well in high school.Vampires need to burst into flame in the daylight, it keeps them incheck, sparking gold is not a bad thing. All that would really happenis that a vampire would pretend to be a male stripper and then killeveryone.And don't tell me "oh you can rip them apart and burn them!" because nohuman can catch, rip apart, and burn a vampire without about 50 otherhumans getting killed, at which point another vampire shows up andkills the rest.The plot is illogical, dripping with teenage drama (even though you'dthink that at about 100 years old Edward would get over it by now), andall classic storytelling techniques have been thrown out for whatsounds like a myspace blog from a Indiana goth teenage girl withpsoriasis and a nub that is technically an extra pinky toe.By the way, this movie would have gotten a better rating if they justhad the damn Indians turn into werewolves and kick some ass.
