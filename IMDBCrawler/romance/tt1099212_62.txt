i am obviously too old to have enjoyed this movie. fans of the seriesmay argue that i'm "uninitiated", as i've never read the books, but iwas tempted to read them before. now i'm not so sure i should take thetime. i love vampires. i've been in love with the mythology of vampiressince i read "interview with the vampire" at the age of eleven. i tendto watch or read anything to do with them, just to give it a chance.who knows (not i)? maybe the books are way better, and i won't shootthem down until i've given them a chance. but really, this movie... ifelt like nothing was happening. i felt that this great love betweenedward and bella was shallow. i understand that her character issupposed to be seventeen, but really, edward was supposed to beseventeen since 1918. not exactly a child, no matter what he may poseas. it seems like one moment she was really going to tell him off, andthe next...then the acting: sub-par, to say the least. i'd come to expect a littlemore from kristen stewart. she was decent in "the messengers", but isuppose that's not enough. she attempts the quiet, introspective, deepthinking teen, or at least how she sees it, and it's very forced.this movie was a waste of my time. i wish i'd stayed up late to watchsomething else.
