I had no other choice but to give this film the lowest rating I canwhich will be a 1 since 0.5 isn't on the charts. I will explain to youwhy most people who like vampire movies will hate this movie to death.It goes the complete opposite direction of what anyone would want adecent vampire movie to have. There is pretty much no violencethroughout the entire film, instead of being aggressive most of thevampires are friendly, the entire story is just about romance whichmakes the movie suck even worse. It was like watching the movieClueless or TV series Degrassi High only no comedy and just strictlythe ditzy chick stuff. Now combine that with the TV series True Bloodbut take out all of the violence and killing, and suspense. What do youget? The worst vampire movie ever made in the history of film making. Iam a huge movie lover its very rare that I bash a film like this, but Ican't say I have ever seen a movie that I hated so much before. Myadvice is to spare yourself from watching this movie.
