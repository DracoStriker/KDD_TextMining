last night finally rented the DVD, expecting a chick flick, someaction, good music and a sense of fantasy and adventure. what I gotback? two hours of lame acting, poor direction, no action, stupidphrases. did I mention the lame acting? there's no development, youcannot care for the characters. I laughed out loud the first time I sawthe vampire youngsters in the school. no one can go walking throughlife with that amount of powder in their face!!! you can tell a mileaway they're blood suckers. and all that Stewart and Pattinson'scharacters do is look into each other eyes, sigh, talk nonsense. Forthe first time in years i used the fast forward button in the remote.seriously!!! It is a product made for girls up to 14 years old. There'sno romanticism here, no fantasy, no sense of epic love. It's more aninfatuation, a whim, opposites attract with no possibility of a futurebased in something else than the pale look of both of the maincharacters. If you're expecting something of a "Harry Potter meetsVampires" movie, you WILL be disappointed. wait until it's on HBO andsave you money. Please do!
