'Twilight' was one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in awhile; atleast that's how it started. Reminding me a lot of 'The Happening,' Ifound myself laughing out loud during the first half and then simplyhating life during the last half. I have heard this was meant forteenage girls. Fine, I get it and I'm not one. However, how I wish morefor them. They deserve so much more. It's absolutely no wonder why thismovie dropped its audience 62% on weekend 2. There are so many pointsto cover for this two-hour tragedy, I'll at least attempt to cover theincredibly bad aspects: awful, laugh-out-loud acting anddialogue/narration, horrible soundtrack, special effects were downrightamusing, the bad ("Johnny Suede") hairdos and the desperate attempts ata franchise ? let's just set up every scene to set the stage for theinevitable part II, III, etc. I'm just going to assume the peopleplaying the parts (it's too nice to call them actors) read the originalmaterial. Well, the "I can't live without you" wooden dialogue seemslike they are seriously reading from the book rather than playing theparts. And one of the worst aspects of this film was the fact thatafter all the lovey-dovey stares, (oh, God, the constant stares Bellaand Edward give each other. STOP, please, God, STOP!) they seemed toforget one of the most basic elements in any plot ? the adversary. OK.Well, let's introduce one 3/4s into the film in the shape of Brad Pitt.Why does he want Bella? To get back to the family? Why? Oh, I guessI'll have to wait for Part II. And yes, I plan on waiting in line forthat film. I'm always in the mood for a good laugh or dozen.
