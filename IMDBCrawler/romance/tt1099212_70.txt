*This review contains spoilers * I repeat * SPOILERS INSIDE* Done myduty, now let's rock :This is probably one of the worst movies. Ever. First of all let'scheck my movie background. I m a horror lover. A thriller/mysterylover. Which means I ve watched A LOT movies with vampires. This is notsuch a movie. The "vampires" are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off the beatentrack. Which sometimes is not bad in itself. But it's another thing toleave the beaten track for a while, and totally another thing to strayso far away, you cant even see the beaten track. The vampires hereshine in the sunlight (my gf said that Cullen shines more than ParisHilton's purse) , YES, SUNLIGHT. Sun doesn't kill them, day doesn'tkill them. Moreover, they are, in their own words, VEGETARIAN. Oh andthey have no pointy teeth. OK, in one sentence : daywalking,shiny,toothless, vegetarian vampires. If that doesn't spoil itfor you.. I ll try again : I respect the genre of romantic comedies,romantic movies etc. The fact that I don't like the genre doesn't meanthat fans of it are idiots or sth. We just have different tastes. OK?Respect. BUT, such cheesines is rare. The female protagonist acts as ifshe is suffering of chronic constipation. The male protagonist was verysuitable for Harry Poter, but this overly white makeup and the cheesyvampiric love lines, don't suit him at all. The lines are awful. Imean, COME OOOON!!! I wouldn't recommend the movie to any adult. Itcould be a masterpiece for adolescents, under 15 though, but I don'tthink the adult audience will like that movie. Sorry for the intensityof this review, but truly, as far as my movie education goes, thismovie is totally awful.
