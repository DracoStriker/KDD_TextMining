*** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED< POSSIBLE SPOILERS**** You know how when theyfigure out a bad shipment of food has been sent out they do a nationalrecall? Well they should nationally recall this film because it ishorrible. The only good thing that came out of it was the fact itpeaked my interest to read the books. I figured there was no way thebooks could be as bad as the movie with the huge amount of fan basethey had. Where was the love, the fire, or for better lack ofappropriate term, the bite. Stewart as Bella was just pathetic,Pattinson as Edward was demeaning and why wasn't Alice given morescreen time? It is a shame these actors were forced to endorse ahorrible film. When I read the books I wanted to be Bella. I believed I could bebecause she was shy, average and had no pretense at all. The movieBella? I wouldn't be her in a million years. Could she not put two fullsentences together? I mean good god I won't care if I never hear umagain as long as I live. She was not convincing in this role. Even thefight scene with her was awful. All the screaming gave me a headacheand when she was "dying" the way her eyes crossed was laughable. I meancome on, who "dies" with their eyes crossed? Edward was just awful. I fell in love with the Book Edward. He makesyou wish and dream of finding someone to love you as much as he lovesBella. The movie Edward? AWFUL!!!In the book Edwards voice is magicalin the movie it gives you a headache. Next time pick someone who canspeak English fluently. In an interview Pattinson says that he did notpractice his English accent for this movie. Well guess what it reallyshows and you could have used some practice. I hope they hire him avoice coach for New Moon and Stewart some acting lessons. On a positive note, I love Charlie. He is so sweet and I loved theactor that played James. He would def. scare me. If you love the books,skip the movie. It barely follows the story line and the books are abetter investment. Time and money wise.
