I am a huge fan of the Twilight books. Of course when I found out amovie was coming out I had to see it. I saw it opening weekend and washorribly disappointed. Without getting into too much detail, there wasjust so much wrong with it.First of all, the only characters that I thought were perfectly castwere Edward, Emmett, and Alice. Kristen Stewart was okay as Bella, butI think someone else could have done a better job.Then of course there were way too many changes from the book to themovie. I know that changes have to be made when you're making a bookinto a movie, but it was just too much. They changed a lot of theseries of events, there was nowhere near enough character development,some of the locations were nothing like they were described in thebook, the lighthearted banter that Edward and Bella always had wasmissing, and everything seemed rushed. It went from Edward being rudeto Bella, Edward saving Bella's life, the 2 of them falling in love,Edward saving her life again, and then Bella being willing to become avampire. It was just ridiculous. The movie really only skimmed thesurface. I also felt that a lot of parts in the book that are crucialto the sequels were completely left out.And it's not just the fact that I loved the book that made this moviebad. I went with a friend who had never read the book and she didn'tlike it either. She said that the movie had no real depth to it, thedialogue didn't flow very well, and that it seemed like just a bunch ofclose up shots of Kristen Stewart.I wanted so much to like this movie. I will probably still buy it whenit comes out on DVD just because I love the books. But it was very verydisappointing. Hopefully if they make New Moon they will do a betterjob and stick more to the books.
