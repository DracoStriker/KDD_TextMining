Wow, being a Twilight fan, the trailers alone set my low standards. ButI wasn't even prepared to sit through two hours of...that. First off,the director, Catherine Hardwicke, was potentially the worst choicepossible to make this film. Her indie style mixed with the camera shotsthat mimicked the acid trips I'm sure she was on ruined the romanticismand drama of the book. I don't feel that she really understood the bookand what it did for people. Everything was flat.Robert Pattinson? Really? Like, really, really? For one, I consider himugly. Two, he can't act. Three, thanks to the soundtrack we've alsolearned that he can't sing. But that aside, he totally missed theconcept of Edward. The faces of utter constipation got annoying afterthe biology scene(which had everyone in the theater laughing). Hiswhiny voice and his constant insecurities were completely not Edward.Bella, was extremely poorly casted. Kristin Stewart as a person, not anactress is too strong to play the weak Bella Swan. Nuff said. She wasjust so...butch in the movie. I can't wait to see how she fails at NewMoon.The romance was appalling. I felt no chemistry between the charactersand it seemed as if it was like BAM LOVE! The movie skimmed past theromance to head to action part. And they really said "lion lamb" line.Lord have mercy I almost left the theater when they said it. Thegraphics were pretty seventies too. This movie was big budget, theycould have done more.And now, for what angered the most: NO ALICE OR JASPER. Um, excuse me,they were only prevalent throughout the last half of the novel! Alicesaid like 15 lines total while Jasper, just looked like a vegetable.This movie, unfortunately, chose to lose its appeal with fans to scoremore money in the box office.I give it two out of ten. One point for the fact that Alice was theonly character that felt fitting. Two, because we get to see her ripJames' head off.
