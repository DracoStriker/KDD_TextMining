"I really like Twilight. It is a very good film." - Orson Welles The Twilight franchise stars Kristen Stewart as Harry Potter, a wizardwho defeats evil Emperor Sauron and so reclaims her position as head ofStarfleet's Jedi Order. Based on a series of books by author TomClancy, the film would spawn a massive fan-base, members of which oftenattend conventions dressed as werewolves, vampires and virgins.The first film in the series, Catherine Hardwicke's "Twilight" raisesmany interesting questions, like "where do babies come from?" and "whatdo you do when two guys like you?" It's also very original and hasnothing to do with sex.10/10 - Masterpiece
