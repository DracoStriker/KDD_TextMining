I watched this with my wife, who has read all the books and reallyenjoyed them. I myself have not read the books, but I figured "hey,it's about vampires, how bad can it be?" Boy was I wrong. We boththought it was horrible. First off the writing was terrible. Too manyclichés and the jokes were not funny at all. The concept was good andthe movie could have been great. But it was entirely way too slow. Iwas bored throughout most of the movie. There were two great scenes,that were really well done. Other than that... blah! The baseball gamewith the vampires was very well done and I also enjoyed the fightscene. Unfortunately there will probably be sequels since so many diehard fans and teenyboppers seem to be entirely wrapped up in thisregardless that the movie was a complete dud.
