This movie was nothing like the beloved book series we have all come toknow and love. It was very apparent that neither the director nor thescreen writer took the time to read this wonderful book series becauseI believe that the movie would have been amazing if they did.There was just so much in the movie that bugged me...like the meadowscene. That scene is the reason why there IS a Twilight series, and forthem just to blow it off made me mad. They didn't talk about Jasperspower or history. They just made him look like he was on something ahorrible .People were laughing at parts of the movie that weren't even supposedto be funny, Bella and Charile ate out instead of Bella cooking. Theymade out in her bedroom, he didn't stay the night with her, I could goon forever! The whole movie was cheesy and I hope they don't pick thesame director/screen writer to do New Moon.
