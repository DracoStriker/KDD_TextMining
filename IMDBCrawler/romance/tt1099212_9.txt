I saw this for free at the Recreational Center on my college campus,and it became the first movie I ever walked out of. As a horror moviefan and a film director, I have never felt so insulted in my life.Since when can vampires survive in daylight. I loved the line "Youavoid daylight".... PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE FILM TOOK PLACE IN BROADDAYLIGHT!!!! Apparently now they just glow and show their "true form"Really? What's next, werewolves will start drinking liquid silver forbreakfast? Frankenstein becomes a fire twirler? Might as well, therules of movie monsters apparently do not apply anymore. When the mainvampire (I didn't care enough to catch his name) said "We considerourselves vegetarians", that was all I could take. Everyone involvedwith this film should have stakes shoved through their hearts forconspiring to create this garbage. Anybody who likes vampires shouldagree with me. If you don't, you are a poser my friend. That is thecold, hard truth.
