I realized that many people have seen this and I wanted to see what allthe fuss was about. I knew that the film was a vampire romance, twogenres that should never be mixed, so I simply asked myself: sparkingvampires who stalk teenage females, how bad could it be? To my dismaywhat I found was a very shallow, tiring, detestable film. Let us firstbegin by looking at the writing. Perhaps some of the funniest dialogthat I have seen in years, this film becomes increasingly disagreeablewith every passing moment. With such immortal words as: "You know, yourmood swings are kinda giving me whiplash," and best of all: "I'dcompare (my life as a vampire) to living on tofu and soy milk," itseems obvious that I cannot take this film seriously. I distinctlyremember literally falling to the floor laughing for most of it. Iwould love to say that this was where the horror ends but of coursethere was the sub par acting to contend with. Awkward momentspunctuated by horrific gazes, this was a clumsy performance from bothmain actors. I only wish they would spend their newly found fortunes onacting lessons. The only item which I believe was tolerable was thedirecting. While there was nothing new to add to the cannon, with suchan atrocious script and actors, I realize the director had a lot tocontend with.I would beg the reader to never see this film. It was horrifyingly badon nearly ever level, not worthy of its hype or fan base. Please avoidat all costs.
