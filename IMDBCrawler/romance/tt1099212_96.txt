I saw this movie and i left so disappointed i couldn't believe it. Notonly was the camera work horrible but the directing was even worse. Imean what was she thinking when she cast those poor excuses for actorsi have never seen such bad acting ever in my life. The books wereawesome and i was so excited to see the movie.I rather watch footballwhich i hate than watch the movie again. Bella and Edward were theworst out of everyone. I wasn't convinced that they were in love, bellalooked like she had no clue what she was doing at all. the was nopassion, no lust, and no anything it was dull and painful to watch. andedward who stole everyones hearts in the books, has now made us wishthat jacob would win. When he saw her for the first time in scienceclass he looked more like he was dying or on drugs rather then someonewho was intrigued and lusted by the smell of a humans blood. I couldact better then both of them any day of the week and its a shame thatnow they have to be used for the rest of the movies. i don't even thinki will see them because its the biggest waste of a day and life.
