I was curious about this movie, but very turned off by the way it wasmarketed & advertised. Reluctantly, I sat through this film and in allof my lifetime (more than 35 years), I have been unable to find a filmwith not one redeeming quality in it......until now.Of course, you will feel like you need to pick up a jar of pimple creamafter seeing this, which is to be expected w/ a teen/pre-teenmovie.Essentially, this is a remake of The Lost Boys, except throughthe eyes of a hormonally charged teenage girl. Everyone is beautiful,pasty white, well dressed, well-to-do, and perfect in everysense......oh,did I happen to mention they were all in high school?????OK.....top line of the movie ...."You are like my own personal brand ofheroin."-in regards to his lust for this girl's blood. Need I saymore??? There's not one kid who smokes, drinks, or does drugs in thismovie......and it's supposed to take place in a small logging communityin the northwest???? Yeah, OK. PLEASE.......they set the end of thismovie up to look like there will be a sequel.....PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS!Take your money and run, go make 10 other chick flicks w/ it, and stopattempting to clothe Nancy Drew in vampire regalia! People.....wake up!This is a complete piece of garbage!
