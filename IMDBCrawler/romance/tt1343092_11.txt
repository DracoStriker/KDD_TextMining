Words cannot even explain how horrible this movie was. It was so hardto follow! The quotes were changed and the storyline was also changed.I have read and studied the book so this did not satisfy my hunger forThe Great Gatsby. Needless to say I think it's pure filth and the onlypeople who will love it will be people who have no idea who F.ScottFitzgerald is or have not read the book. The book revolved around the1920s and the bootleg era, I'm pretty sure this was also the JAZZ eranot Jay-Z or Beyonce! The music was horrible and processed! Wordscannot explain how horrible it was. I think the director should pay formy treatment! Director was to focused on 3D that there was a cuteverywhere. Why would anyone ruin the best Novel of all time? Why?
