Wow. I just returned from viewing the great Gatsby. This movie was byfar one of the absolute worst, confusing, and boring movies I have everseen. The fact that Toby McGuire was the lead speaking voice wasembarrassing and humiliating to anyone who considers themselves a fanof this motion picture. This movie had no substance or direction. Theamount of CGI used in this movie to display New York City and drivingscenes was the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. I wouldn'teven give Daisy a 4 on looks, and Leonardo Dicaprio is willing to getkilled for her? No way. She was beat. And the music at the partiesresembled party rock anthem by LMFAO. Dreadful movie. If you or your loved ones had to suffer through this completelydisgraceful piece of garbage some may call a motion picture, may godhave mercy on your, or their souls, and I would advise anyone who hasnot seen this movie to never consider purchasing a ticket.
