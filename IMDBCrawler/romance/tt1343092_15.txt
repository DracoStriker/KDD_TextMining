Plain and simple the movie is awful. I painfully watched it over 2 daysas my wife wanted to see it. The cinematography is all over the placeand the movie is like watching a cartoon with living characters. To addinsult to injury they added Rap music to a movie that takes place inthe 1920s. I think the producers were on drugs when they release thispiece of garbage. If you are among the twenty somethings that likedMoulin Rouge, or enjoy the annoying Quentin Tarantino movies you maylike this. If you enjoy good movies this is not for you. Put it likethis, watching the laundry turn in a dryer is more interesting thanthis movie, and the acting is just as good.
