This is really awful. There is so much wrong with this rubbish...onecould write a book about it. Mixing modern music with 1920s music? HeyBaz Luhrmann (director)----cant you live without CGI and additionalnonsense??? The 1974 version was not great...........but it was in somany ways much better than this drivel. Robert Redford was a realGatsby ...his use of the upper class language was 100% better thanDiCaprios .....who never got the Gatsby character (he was terrible).Bruce Dern, Sam Waterston, Karen Black, Scott Wilson.....the 1974supporting cast...... were far superior to this 2013 rabble. Thedirector Baz Luhrmannm came to Australia recently to promote thisinsult to Scott Fitzgerald on the television media and said he wasretiring soon. He needs to. O.K.....Old Sport ?....Fitzgerald wouldhave hated this. He would have also disliked the 4 previous movieattempts at this work. Leave Gatsby alone movie makers----or call inthe A team of directors. (and actors)
