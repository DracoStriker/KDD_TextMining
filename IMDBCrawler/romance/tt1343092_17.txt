Coco Chanel said "Once you've dressed, and before you leave the house,look in the mirror and take at least one thing off." This is what Bazshould have done. In The Great Gatsby's case, a lot more than one thingshould have been taken off or out of this film. It is Over The Top;Bad. Too much fake CGI.In a major cinema complex in Sydney in Cinema 1 (largest theatre in thecomplex) on the second night of opening it was bearly one quarter fulland even then a whole row of 10 patrons walked out after that sillyscene in the underground jazz club.It is a cacophony of nothingness. Too much fluff and tinsel. Nosympathy for any character could be felt.P.S. And the blinking green light... Yes, we can see it. Yes, we knowwhat it means. Yes, we are not dumb!!
