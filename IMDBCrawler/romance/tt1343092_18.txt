Genuinely awful movie. Watching Toby Macguire act is like watching amannequin that's realized its sentient but still chooses to do nothingabout it. The cinematography feels like the work of an overzealouschild. HEY LOOKS LETS GO ACROSS THE RIVER... WHOOOSH... HEY LETS GOBACK ACROSS THE RIVER... WHOOOSH... LETS GO INTO TOWN... WHOOOSH...LETS GO BACK HOME... ZOOOOM. I lost IQ points for sitting through that.I'm secretly hoping that the unobtainable green light on the dockrepresents the green light for all other future movies this directorwants to direct.The films only saving grace is that it ends.
