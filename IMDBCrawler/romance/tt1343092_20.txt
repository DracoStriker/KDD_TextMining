Rap music in a 1920s film? Really?FAIL!!Was the music of the era not good enough for the film makers that theyhad to drown the film in generic modern crap music?Why do directors think that everything needs to be current to besuccessful?Why do we need super fast editing as if we all have ADHD?Why do we need shaky cameras in every other scene?Yes, the movie has nice art direction, sets and costumes, buteverything was lost the minute modern music started playing. Takes anyimmersion of the period right out of you.I stopped watching this travesty after the first 30 minutes.Simply horrible.
