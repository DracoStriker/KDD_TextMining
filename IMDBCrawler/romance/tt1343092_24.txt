by far the worst movie of the year. an even worse movie than 'This isthe End,' which is saying something. i have no idea what DiCaprio wasthinking signing up for this turd, but he mailed in his performance, asdid Maguire, and who can really blame them?the movie turns Carraway and Gatsby into characters that might as wellhave come from some 'MTV Live' sketch show. even Tom is sympathetic inthis farce, as the one early scene in the book that establishes hischaracter is muted down in this travesty.no thanks to the director for taking an American classic and reducingit to a sanitized, make-believe Disney world. stick to ruiningShakespeare, old sport.
