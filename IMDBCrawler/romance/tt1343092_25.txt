You'll always make a profit appealing to the basest needs of today'scommon viewer.First review I've ever written, and been compelled to write. Let'swatch a few moments of this movie together now, through my eyes."I am Baz Lurhmann and I can do this, and this and this. This is me,Baz Lurhmann, every instant of this movie reminding you who I am. I amthe director, Baz Lurhmann, and I can do anything I want with mycreation and you will love it because you are impressionable. BazLurhmann is my name and I've added this foolish flourish to this sceneand this cartoonish effect to this section and this unnecessarydistraction over here. Watch and listen to something completely out ofcontext, there. Why? Because my whim is all that matters, after all, Iam Baz Lurhmann. Watch me vomit on your lap to your delight, here..."OK enough. I could only stand about 15 minutes of this steaming turdbefore I was ready to throw a shoe at the screen. I walked out in arage. Not being as familiar as others it took me a while to recallwhere and when I'd felt the same flavor of revulsion and had then alsowalked out of a movie. And then I remembered; Australia, anotheroffensive, egotistic, gigantic steaming turd.So much of the movie going masses are so easily impressed by emptyglitz.
