The novel The Great Gatsby is the rose and Baz Luhrmann just buriedthis rose under a pile of dynamite and blew it into a million pieces. I'm so disappointed I feel like crying. It's not fair that Baz messedthis movie up like this. Probably almost any director would've done abetter job. IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE A subtle ROMANCE MOVIEBAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, NOT A LOUD VH1 MUSIC VIDEO.I'm so sad, so so sad. If only I can direct it. Daisy was a goodactress and so was her husband. They did a great job, leo sucked asusual. isla fisher was pretty good. nick caraway sucked. jordan bakerwas so so. baz, the novel was about how much gatsby loved daisy and how he alwaysbelieved in the pale green harbor light. He had faith in his destiny,no matter how much the fog of war obscured the pale green glow. He evencovered up the fact that daisy accidentally hit the woman just to showhow much he cared for her and wanted to get back together. And in theend, it was a good ending if you think about it, just before gatsby'sdreams were about to be shattered by the realization that daisy won'tbe with him anymore, he was still in his pool day dreaming about daisywhen the merciful bullet pierced his dreams.BAZ, YOU are Wilson in real life!
