This takes place in the 1920s. Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire) narrates itfrom a sanitarium. It's about Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) who isVERY wealthy and his obsession with Daisy (Carey Mulligan). The problemis she's married to someone else.The novel is great but this movie completely trashes it. It makesill-conceived changes in the story and goes on far too long. Also it'sWAY overdone. There are endless parties at Gatsby's mansion and they'reshoved in your face nonstop. A few times I had to close my eyes becausethere was too much going on! I saw it in 2D--in 3D it must beimpossible to watch. When it isn't in your face it's deadly dull andmoves at a snails pace. To make matters worse Maguire is lousy. Totallyblank-faced in his role. Mulligan (who can be good) was even worse! Inever got a grasp on her character or motivations. On the other handDiCaprio was great as Gatsby. He's grown into an amazing actor. Verygood-looking too. But this movie is mostly concerned with visuals--notthe story. It manages the impossible--it's boring and overdone at thesame time! Read the book instead.
