i have seen a lot of average movies, a lot of poor movies and a lot ofterrible movies in over fifty years of viewing. Never have i seen amovie that has failed in all areas.Indeed, the only thing that was successful was that the failures weretotal failures except for one. Leonardo did his best but even he couldnot save this total flop of a movie.The lack of direction, the number of bloopers, the poor acting &casting, the weak script, ridiculous music and comic likecinematography all blended to aid in the demise of this venture.A worthwhile project, poorly executed and badly edited.Save your money, do not go and see this movie, you will regret everycent you spend on it. Your money would be better spent paying someoneto hit you, repeatedly, over the head with a dead fish.Shame on you baz, for deceiving the movie going public so badly and forhaving such a great actor humiliate himself in your ridiculous excusefor movie.
