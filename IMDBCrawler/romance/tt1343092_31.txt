what a great disappointment this movie was. a totally unrealistic andpoorly directed movie i am a die-hard Leonardo fan but this was theworst movie i have seen him in. my wife and i have watched nearly tenthousand movies together over the years. we have only ever walked outof three movies. the great gatsby was the third.the camera shot changes were so fast they hurt the eyes and the wholemovie was a cross between a poor melodrama and and a badly producedfarce. after enduring one hour and ten minutes of overstimulation and acare less attitude from the actors, we decided to leave.for a movie that promised so much, it delivered very little. even thegreat Leonardo DiCaprio seemed disinterested in his part. heparticularly appeared reluctant to deliver his lines when they includedthe words old sport.
