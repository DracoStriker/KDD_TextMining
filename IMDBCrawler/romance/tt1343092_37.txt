I finally saw Leonardo DiCaprio version of The Great Gatsby, what apiece of sh*t!. Whats with hip-hop and rap music soundtrack for a1920's period film?A lot of stupid computer generated special effects.Completely stupid and un- believable party scenes, so phony. Thedirector took a great period film and turned into Disney-esque, teenageaudience crap. I can tell by watching this that the movie was filmedfor 3D viewing with a lot of unnecessarily bizarre camera shots, thrownin special effects and glitz that does not belong in a 1920's periodfilm. I mean really Mr DiCaprio, you could have been in a great period filmfor The Great Gatsby, like Titanic (with its authentic look and feel).The 1974 Robert Redford version was much much better.
