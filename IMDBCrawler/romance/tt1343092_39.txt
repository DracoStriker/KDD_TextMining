Well ... that was a waste of time ... just watched 30 minutes of thenew Great Gatsby movie and was not impressed at all. It is like a longstudy in visual effects: like those horrible fast paced cut jumpcommercials you see on television. All glitter and no substance. Eyecandy that reflects the emptiness of American culture ... a nauseating,stomach-churning, sickly sugar coated stench of a movie ... disgustingin it's endless glitter and carnival atmosphere. Another Hollywoodaction packed visual monstrosity bereft of meaning and an insult toyour intelligence ... Over the top and into the garbage can. Hollowfacade and veneer. No sensitivity, nothing resembling anything remotelycontemplative or introspective. Pure entertainment for the mindlessdistracted masses. An endless and relentless exaggeration. An emeticvisual diarrhea ... sheer hyperbole.
