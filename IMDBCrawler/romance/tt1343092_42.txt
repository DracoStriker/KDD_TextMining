what a total waste of time, money and effort. tried to watch it throughbut began feeling ill after an hour of this garbage. and i have managedto watch attack of the killer tomatoes one and a half times, which waspreviously the worst movie ever made.poorly directed if at all, unrealistic scenes & characters. and what awoeful soundtrack. the cinematography was so bad it deserves firstprize in whatever the opposite of the academy awards are.the actors tried hard, but no one could have saved this from been atotal flop. do not waste your money or time going to see this, you willbe very disappointed.
