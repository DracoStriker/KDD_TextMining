20 minutes into this and I am ready to turn it off. I am so glad I didnot pay to see this in the theater. The rap music played throughout,totally does not fit. When I began to watch, and saw who was playingNick Carraway, I immediately had high hopes, but this movie is a wasteof time... trash.The original with Robert Redford was a classic, with classy charactersportrayed by actors with a touch of class. They have ruined a classicby making these characters ordinary and crude. I'll admit I didn't likeDaisy any more in the original than I do in this version but at leastthe original demonstrated some class. This one is all raunch. I lovedthe characters in the original... with the exception of Tom who Ipassionately disliked... but he was supposed to be an unlikeablecharacter. None of the characters in this version are likable in anyway.It is hard to watch and I don't know if I'll see it through to the end.That will depend on whether or not Leonardo DiCaprio can bring anythingto it.One hour in and I couldn't watch any more. Watch the original if youappreciate good film making.
