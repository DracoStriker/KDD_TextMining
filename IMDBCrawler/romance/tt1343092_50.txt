I went to see this movie because of DiCaprio, who became a guaranteefor a good movie lately. Well, not this time.The story itself is typical Hollywood-style romantic-"drama", actuallynot that lame by default, but whoever wrote the script and done thedirecting, got the worst out of it.I felt like watching a 3rd category Brazilian soap-opera, where theydrag every obvious step or act well beyond the border of annoyance. Gatsby's character is really irritating and stupid and the 'mistery'around him is really poorly constructed. Also I'd be surprised ifDiCaprio (or anyone else) would get nominated for his acting.The worst thing in all is that there is no really action, just sometrumped and endless suffering of some rich-ass people combined withabominably bad directing.I'd rather watch the Cloud Atlas (which was quite a pain as well) 10times than this movie again. Some of my friends liked it, no idea why, but maybe there is anaudience for such movie, I'm not just part of it. Anyways, in case youdecide to go for it and you're not liking it after the first 15minutes, don't expect any change later. Just leave and save 2 hrs orsuffering.
