One of the most beautiful masterpieces of American literature has beenunfairly mistreated here, one more time, as Hollywood and literaturedon't match often. Jesus Christ, whose idea was to cast Tobey Maguirefor the role of Nick Carraway? I was just looking to Spiderman all thetime, a funny character, childish, and sometimes plain idiotic. It onlytakes to read one page of the Fitzgerald's book to realize that Nickwas a very serious man, almost depressed (as it was Gatsby, being bothof them Fitzgerald's alter egos). This is a book about sadness, aboutthe depression that plagued that period in American history. Fitzgeraldwas one of the most prominent exponents of the Lost Generation, andthat's the feeling that the book conveys in a masterful way. Thismovie, however, looks for the most part (especially the first half ofthe movie) just like another fancy Hollywood movie, made with theintention to be a blockbuster and nothing else. The entrance of Gatsby was vague and plain, diminished in front of thebackground paraphernalia. I can even tolerate the modern electronicmusic, but all those computer generated scenarios with the fancy cameramovements a la Disney are just ridiculous. And of course, you have thespeed, the very short shots that don't allow for a meaningful grasp ofthe situations and the characters. There are some achievements, however, like some of the acting (I don'tthink De Caprio is that terrible, is just the entire thing what makeshim look not convincing at times) and the girls are OK, as well asBuchanan and other minor characters. The visuals are sometimes prettygood and interesting, if you take off the Disney like stuffs. Iunderstand that the director wanted to do something different,something ironic and postmodern, in the line of Moulin Rouge, but Ithink that it is just a failure to go that way with this literarymasterpiece. It just falls very short, and does not make any justice tothe stature of Fitzgerald.
