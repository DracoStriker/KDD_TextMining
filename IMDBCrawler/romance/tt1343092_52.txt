This movie...I wanted to like it. Honest. There is much that is good,such as the costumes and attention to visual detail in backgroundprops. Also, it's fair to say performances are solid. No award winnershere, but the actors didn't cause any issues. Music, however... I'msorry. It sucked. The music was 80% modern rap and hip-hop, with 20%period instrumentation and style. Hip-hop sung as 20's jazz is stillhip-hop. And it does NOT belong in a period piece. So not only did Ihate the music now, but in just a few short years, this movie will haveno relevance because the music will sound like it came from the 'teens.People watching this for the first time in 2022 (only 8 years fromtoday) will feel how 2012-ish this music is. If you're doing a periodpiece, then use period music! Perhaps you have the Hot Young Stars ofToday perform the music, but if you have a period piece, use periodmusic! Please! Also, there were a series of car driving and car chasescenes that helped to blow the movie for me. The image doesn't sync upwith the conversation at ALL. And in every driving scene the cars seemto be driving 100 mph (that's 161 kph for my friends in the rest of theworld). The car scenes were so unrealistic, I would rather they didn'teven show them at all. A block of text saying "car driving" and thedialogue voiced over would have been a great improvement. I wanted tolike this movie. I really did. But it's pretty bad. Don't botherwatching it.
