WOW. Just WOW. I just finished it and I'm speechless. It is one ofthose films that is remembered after ages. I won't start talking aboutthe how well it is made and how good it looks especially in 3D, but Iwill tell you what you need to enjoy this movie.Intelligence.Intelligence above average. It is so well writtend and directed itmakes you think about all the time. I stopped for a few times to answerthe phone and get a glass of water and I thought about what justhappened in the movie.You also need emotional intelligence. If you watched it and you don'tknow what I'm talking about, you don't have it. Simple.Sadly it is far under rated, but it doesn't matter, because if you havethe qualities, it will make you feel like nothing else, and that iswhat it's made for.
