A director makes a movie called Moulin Rouge. It works very well, so hetries to make the same dang movie with another theme. That is,Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. Not surprisingly, it is less successful thesecond time round. It's not that the acting was bad, or thecinematography wasn't enjoyable, it's simply that he tried to recreateMR in a new setting. Same tortured writer at the typewriter. Sameexcesses and debauchery. Same sweeping camera shots. Same hauntingbackground musical theme. And, well, it doesn't work - at all! I was,in fact, upset by the blatant parallels between the movies, and thoughtsomeone creative enough to make MR in the first place could have doneso much more with GG.
