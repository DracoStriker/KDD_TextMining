I really enjoyed this film.On a separate note, I also really enjoyed the book.I am confused why a number of people are posting negative commentsbased on the fact that the movie didn't match identically to theirinterpretation of Fitzgerald's storyline/characters etc. The film is an'adaptation' not a replica or an identical copy. The whole theorybehind the creation of films is in order to entertain people, and thisfilm, very effectively entertained me.Another fantastic Di Caprio performance, will this chap ever do a badmovie?
