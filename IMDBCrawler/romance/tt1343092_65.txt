Watched about 45mins, slow going, boring, Gatsby was about asinteresting as watching a cat take a dump. Acting was poor. Setscluttered and meaningless. Story was not put over to be understandable.Maybe when I get time I'll watch the entire film and maybe, just maybeI wont take a dump halfway thro. From watching the trailers it appearedthat it would be a film full of mystery, but they were better than thefilm itself. Maybe if it was explained what the hell was actuallyhappening in the first part of the film I wouldn't have spent the restof the time wondering what the point was. Tedious is an understatement.Several trips to the loo, a shower, made some toast, a cup of coffeeand still no further incite to what it was about. Maybe I was expectingmore of it than there was.
