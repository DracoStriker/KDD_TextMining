having endured this movie for one hour and ten torturous minutes, i amdisgusted that so many people are giving it a positive review. it hasno redeeming features at all and only leonardo has come out this withany of his credentials in place, but not all of them.i hope people who read these reviews read enough of the accurate onesand save their hard earned dollars for something more enjoyable, like avisit to the dentist. even a root canal treatment is preferable to thepain of this mish mash that tries to be everything but ends up beennothing.there has never been a more poorly directed, poorly cast and badlyfilmed movie. the script was woeful as is shown by the actors totaldisinterest in delivery of their lines.this movie is not a movie but a collection of painful, embarrassingscenes.do not go and see it, and if you do, you have been warned.
