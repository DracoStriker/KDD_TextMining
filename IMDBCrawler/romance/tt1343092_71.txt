There are two things that save this film from being an utterabomination, they are the literary work from whence it emanated and theacting prowess of Leonardo DiCaprio. Tom Buchanan looked more like NickCaraway's father than a friend from school and Tobey Maguire is poorcasting as the wide-eyed imbecile; his lack of talent stark contrastagainst the skill of his co-star.The first half hour or so was simply a riot of colour and terriblemusic which did not befit the film at all! I believe that a carefullyselected modern score can compliment a film which is set in an earlierperiod however the choice was poor, unflattering and so divisive that inearly turned off. The costumes are well selected but again the earlysections of the film were simply a riot of colour, noise and fashionwhich rather than add to the celebration of shallowness and wealth thatit so overtly tried to depict, distracted from any nuance by way of thedirectors own ego. In conclusion, subtle it ain't!
