The acting was okay, but what really sucked was the music. I don'tthink rap music was popular back then. I had to turn it off after 30minutes. A horrible movie in my opinion. I'll stick with the 1974version instead. Sam Waterson was a better Nick Carraway anyway. And Icouldn't stand Gatsby's accent! Although it did have some things thatwere similar to the book, not everything was there. And I think thatMyrtle in this movie looked a little too "skanky" to be a woman livingin the 1920's. And I didn't like the beginning when Nick was talking inthe insane asylum. It was pointless in my opinion. Even though I didn'tfinish watching it, I don't think I ever will. It was a movie that Iwant to forget. The book and the 1974 version were way better!
