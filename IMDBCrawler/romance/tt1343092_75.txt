This piece of garbage provides accurate insights into the crudeness andobsession with immediate gratification that now characterize Americanpopular culture, but conveys absolutely nothing of the heart and soulof the novel, or the era it depicts. Gatsby's first encounter withDaisy is pathetic enough when compared to Redford/Farrow (1974)andLadd/Field (1949), but the garish party scene where Nick first meetsGatsby is meant to appeal to the basest mentalities, and nothing more.There wasn't enough good music, and enough style, during the 1920'sthat hip hop and rap need to be injected here? Give me a break. For thereviewers who praised DeCaprio's performance, I can only shake my headin bewilderment. A.O. Scott's review in The New York Times, whichincludes this gem, "the best way to enjoy the film is to put asidewhatever literary agenda you are tempted to bring with you." is aninsult to the intelligence of any high school senior taking AP English,let alone self respecting adults who have loved the book from itsopening pages. Should we disregard the fact that we admire Fitzgerald'scraftsmanship, and somehow enjoy watching this exercise insensationalism posing as art ? This movie provides a sad window intoour society today, and nothing more.
