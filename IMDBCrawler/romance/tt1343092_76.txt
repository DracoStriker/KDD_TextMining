Unwatchable due to the overused special effects, cringing acting anddetestable zero-dimensional characters. Are we really supposed tobelieve that this supernaturally great man harbours these intensefeelings that form his every action for an irritating vacuous fairy whois young enough to be his daughter? There is nothing great about thisGatsby(hey director, you can't just list a load of unbelievable factsto make someone appear great, you have to show it through theirbehaviour and develop their personality)and the couple display noattraction towards one another. I've seen more passion in 2 pieces ofcardboard. DiCaprio has been in some decent films since casting off histitanic scar. This performance will put him back years. That firstscene where he appears flashing his teeth like some kind of demigodmade me physically retch, which kept happening each time that he wason-screen. Surely his worst ever film, in fact the worst film of all,with or without him, that I can remember, and I've seen some bad ones.This has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
