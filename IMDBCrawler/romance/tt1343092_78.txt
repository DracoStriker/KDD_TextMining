I really don't get the reason behind so many negative reviews of thisfilm. I thought visually this film is incredibly stunning. From grandsets to the detailed period dresses, this film is a treat for the eyes.The direction in this film is impeccable. The cinematography ismarvelous and really lets the viewer absorb the sheer artistry that hasgone into making this film. Performances are phenomenal by the entirecast. Carey Mulligan's Daisy is every bit as careless as one wouldexpect, but she also manages to show some complexity in her role. TobeyMaguire is a great avatar for us to take on as we enter this film. Heis very much the viewer as he sees everything happening, but iseventually helpless to change anything. The true standouts in the filmare Joel Edgerton and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is probably the onlyactor of this generation that could play Gatsby, just as Robert Redfordcould only play Gatsby the previous generation.
