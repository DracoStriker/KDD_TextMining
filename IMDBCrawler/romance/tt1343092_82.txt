A sudden realization in such a powerful way that it change your way ofthinking. Never before has the world around you been so clear.The Great Gatsby. When the moment when the movie darkened and finallycame to an end, it felt different. You have lost an argument that youfor so long hold on to and that you thought was right, but no more. Youhave changed.Please, see it. You have to experience its content, not read about it.My best regards to this movie and I highly recommend it. A masterpieceby Baz Luhrmann.//I would insist to watch Titanic (1997), it shares something, afeeling, a truth. Please, watch Titanic first and after you haveexperienced The Great Gatsby, you watch Titanic again.//
