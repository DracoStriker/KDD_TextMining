Imagine if one day Michael Bay, famous for the high action epic movie,decided to remake the Ingmar Bergman trilogy. It would be full of cutsand grand scenes and instead of muted verbal clashes there would befist fights. Of course the camera would be so restless as to give asense of vertigo and the scene transitions would be rapid.Clearly a mismatch of talent and purpose, It's the same thing here with a shallow meaningless idiotic versionthat only shows how little the writing team and the director understoodthe material. The defense would be that it works for the currentgeneration. And that may be true if weren't such a meretriciousirrelevant argument. It is a travesty to update something out ofrecognition, as perhaps a Bay version of any Ingmar Bergman film wouldbe.In a way it has to be slick; that is to be a massive sleight of hand,in order to conceal any genuine working or interpretation with thematerial. This is shock and awe but once the deceit is recognized it'sclear that it is really just junk - expensive enough to erase reasonfor a minute or two, but junk all the same.A real director would have made something of the very simple material;it is a very slight piece of prose after all, but that requiresmaturity and expertise to interpret, and in its place, are thegrandiose visions of a music video director from 1984.
