The most shocking in this movie is that a director managed such badlywith regards to the cinematography ? especially during the first hour ?with those continuous travellings, CGIs and other unrefinedgreen-screen that succeed each other at a frantic pace to try to blowthe viewer away with this tawdry and corny universe. And what about theanachronistic soundtrack which associates rap, RnB or dance to the1920's... it must be a joke.And if the form is a complete fiasco, the content also struggles toconvince. The first hour is very long and doesn't develop much,favoring the visual aspect and stylistic effects. The movie becomes alittle more interesting when problems arise but it remains reallylaborious until a final outcome that doesn't trigger any reaction. Onthe whole, the script is a lot too linear, it doesn't arouse anyemotions and the characters, who are sold as ultra profound, all seemshallow as the tacky world they live in.Only the cast barely saves the day in this incredible flop that is TheGreat Gatsby.
