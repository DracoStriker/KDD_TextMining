Luhrmann's Great Gatsby is first of all brightly-coloured imagery andpowerful audio-solicitation, excessive and over-mannered, as to get,sometimes, grotesque, but certainly appealing, mainly while depictingthe extravagance of sumptuous parties. But this is the spirit of theroaring twenties, vibrating with intoxicating energy, and the styleemployed is well matched with the sparkling vitality of those times(and, by the way, you cannot expect sobriety in a work by a directorlike him).So, splendor of the scenery, awesome costumes and jewels, marvelouscakes and sparkling champagne abound and appeal the viewer since fromthe very beginning of the picture. Not to mention the irreverent use ofmusic, with shocking covers and an hazardous contamination between hippop and traditional jazz. The picture, however, is not only explosiveenergy and affected mannerism, on the contrary it pulses with emotionin dialogues and situations, and here the novel upon which it is basedemerges clearly.Of course, if you compare the movie with Fitzgerald's work, you realizethat some depth is missing, especially that sense of decay and despairtypical of those same shimmering years. However, it is alwaysdifficult, sometimes impossible, to transpose complex literary works,especially those where the evocative power of the written word provessuperior to the necessary directness of the visual image. But thescreenplay and the use of camera help emphasise the inner anxiety ofGatsby and the mysterious nature of Nick, supported by the talentedperformances of the actors (Di Caprio is great as usual, and morehandsome than ever), who interact very well with the femaleperformances. To sum up, the final product proves effective andincisive, and the long timerun never bores, on the contrary the picturekeeps its quick pace and brilliant touch till the end.
