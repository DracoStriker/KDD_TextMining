I watched this film with a sort of tender curiosity.It was deliciously excessive and exaggerated, as expected from a BazLuhrmann production. Leonardo DiCaprio made Gatsby his own ("Oldspor'!") while retaining a feeling of familiarity. The screenplay was afaithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel'sthemes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during theJazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.But I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.Gatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard toforget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it wasNick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald'sstory, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good asNick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him thatway.Unfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrativeguide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann'sdreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And ?with him ? so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire,Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to beingjust another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).Luhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tellthe story ? first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium,then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose. But thosescenes came across (at best) as heavy-handed expository or (at worst)as Maguire's uninspired take on an abridged audiobook version of "TheGreat Gatsby."I wanted to love this film. I really did. It had so many wonderfulqualities. But with no Nick (only a Tobey) to help make sense of thepeople and events, "angry, and half in love with {it}, and tremendouslysorry, I turned away."
