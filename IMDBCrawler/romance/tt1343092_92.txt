Whoever decided that blaring modern pop/ hip hop music into a story ofthe early 20's was a good idea needs their heads examined. It not onlyremoves you completely from the story but jolts you so far out of itthat you need a few minutes to try and refocus yourself back into thestory. (and that's not a knock on this genre of music, it just has noplace here..) After an hour, I could stand no more, the acting and story seemedgreat, but the soundtrack was too much to take.So much great music was made during this time period that if usedeffectively could have elevated this story. Such a waste.
