This was one of the worst films I have viewed in years andappropriately, it should have been named Dread Pool.In reality, this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever. A Batmanlike character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and togain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancerdiagnosis.What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind womancarrying heat?How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actorin a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord hedidn't win the award.There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for alife-time.
