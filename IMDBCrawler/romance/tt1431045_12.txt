Truly awful rendition of a Marvel superhero. Turgid, adolescent andinane, routine CGI effects and a plot you could write on the back of apostage stamp. The so-called comedy lines are expelled as if from afailing gattling gun, interspersed with fantasy fillers includingmasturbation, soft toys and sex in Christmas sweaters. If this isyou're thing - I suppose, go for it. Everyone else stay well clear. Had this been counter-balanced in any way by a genuine malevolence fromour "hero" there may have been some redemption, but the violence is alljust meaningless, cartoonish and blah.Incredible that the back story involves Deadpool's attempt to "win backthe girl" when he, and everything else in this waste of money movie isso overwhelmingly camp. Right up to the end credits when our hero, as acartoon, jerks off a unicorn's horn to produce an ejaculate made ofrainbows and fairy-dust. Truly, this is the very stuff this risiblemovie is made from.
