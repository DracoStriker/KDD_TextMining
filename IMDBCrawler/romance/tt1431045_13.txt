One word describes this movie - pointless.Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie overnothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn't even feel like Iwas watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TVseries with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on hispointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. The X-men were pointless as well. They didn't add anything to thestory. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains whentheir original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happilyaccepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the actionstill could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and atother times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. Itdidn't feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are goingto fail very easily.I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit toexplain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. "superheroes","superslaves" etc. What are these villains even doing? There wasnothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. Thestory was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty andhollow.Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they wouldenjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that isthe only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of"F" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it isgory and violent. None of this is new. Again, the Story and Charactersare terrible.
