I wish I could have those 108 minutes back. This was just bad. Writtenby two terrible writers. Directed by an animation/titles guy. Acted bya grown man pretending to be 12. Costarring a female him. How is thisconsidered entertaining? Everyone sounds exactly the same. Tons of timejumps to dress up the bad storyline. It's like a cross between VanWilder, Kill Bill, and Striptease. If this is at all a reflection ofwhat comic book fans want to see, I'm truly disappointed. How thispossibly made over 10 to 1 in box office is unreal. Is this the endresult of the internet vs reading real books? Zero imagination. Zerodelivery. Zero quality. Worse than Thor 2.
