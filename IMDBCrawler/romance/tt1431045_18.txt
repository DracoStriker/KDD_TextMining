Let me just say off the bat that I liked this movie overall. The actionand the humor were both very good, and Ryan Reynolds nailed the role ofDeadpool.With that said, Deadpool, the infamous anti-hero known for constantlybreaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional, is stuckin a way too conventional movie that doesn't take enough risks.Deadpool in this film is very much himself, and there's plenty ofR-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in theend, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakestpoint of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax(possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like thelove interest and goofy sidekick. It's all a little too conventionalfor such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the moviesuffers.
