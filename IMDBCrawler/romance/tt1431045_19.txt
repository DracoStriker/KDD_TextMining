I resisted the urge to turn this off after the first 5 or 10 minutes,as I was thinking 'here we go again, another wise-cracking, cocksurespandex ass-kicker'. Instead, I stuck with it, and ended up quiteenjoying it, contrary to expectation. The film quickly gets into thecharacter's back story and over the course of the film, I found myselfwarming to him. Sure, Wade Wilson starts off as an insufferable prick,whose geekiness is only matched by his dedication to bodybuilding (acombination that only happens in the movies) - but the travails heundergoes at the hands of Ajax, made his ascent to superhero status alot more palatable.Marvel are a bit late to the party with the whole post-modern shtickthough and for all its fourth-wall breaking, self-referencing smarts,it's still a pretty conventional superhero film. It's more like a newflavour of drink, rather than a new take on drinks altogether.Subversive it ain't - Marvel are having their cake and eating it withthis film, irreverently sending up many of the tropes they themselveshave established, while still employing them to the full. It's slickand cynical, but entertaining, in a puerile kind of way; despite someeye-rolling at the more heavy-handed touches - especially the openingcredits - there's also a few laughs along the way. It feels darker anddirtier than most of Marvel's recent offerings too, which is a goodthing in my book after asinine fluff like GOTG, but it's hard to escapethe fact that the studio is still just cleaving to its formula, albeitwith a nudge and a wink this time round.
