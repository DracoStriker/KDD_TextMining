After hearing everyone raving about how funny and awesome this film wasI just had to rent it. And I couldn't be anymore disappointed. Thejokes were eh like looking into the camera and trying to crack a jokeor hitting someone in the crotch or even taking one up the ass(you knowwhat I mean if you seen it). As a fan of the X-men Film series thisColossus bugged me a lot. His accent was so annoying and his powerisn't to stay full on metal the entire time. I did like his othermutant friend she was cliché but was decently funny. I will say DeadPool's stunts are awesome and that's great but I felt the movie is nowhere near as good as the other X-men Films yes including The LastStand but not including the Wolverine Origins. Its okay at best not thebest movie of the year but not the worst. Give it a try but have lowexpectations.
