I'd never heard of this film, the only reason I sat through it all wasbecause I was on a long distance flight and it was part of the inflightentertainment. Entertained, I was not. Now there are two kinds of bad films, ones that are so bad they arefunny and the others that are just bad, unfortunately this falls intothe latter category. It would not be possible to put a plot spoiler in this review, sincethe film has no plot. Basically, someone decided to make a film withthe usual explosions, car crashes and gun fire and put a really campguy in a red suit and give him as many awful unfunny one liners aspossible. To perfect the badness of the awful script they found areally bad actor to deliver unfunny lines, although granted, even AlPacino could not make this script good.The only thing fascinating about this film is the fact that somebodymade it, edited it and released it, not noticing how truly awful thisfilm is. If I were an actor, I would be so embarrassed to be associatedthis film. This really could go down as one of the worst films evermade, but not in a good way. I would not have believed with a budget of$58,000,000 somebody could make such a truly terrible film, it's justincredibly bad.
