This has become my 21 y/o son's new favorite movie. My 16 y/o daughterloves it too. They both love comic-book movies but my wife, who (likeme) can take them (Batman) or leave them (...lots to list here....)also liked it.I don't get it. I have a pretty high tolerance for profanity (I made itthru Straight Outta Compton without flinching) and am willing to getpast excessive violence if there's something left when you get past allthat (The Matrix is one of my top 5; I loved City of God; ...) but whenyou strip away the (sometimes clever) profanity and well-stagedviolence there's literally nothing left here.I don't get it.
