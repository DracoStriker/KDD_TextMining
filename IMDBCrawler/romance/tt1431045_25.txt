For those who are familiar with the character Deadpool, this film doeshim justice. For those new to the character and his story, you're infor a treat. Needless to say, I was excited about seeing this movie forthe first time. As a character, Deadpool is the embodiment of comedy,parody, and slapstick while still delivering a satisfactory level ofgore and mayhem. Ryan Reynolds gave his character a new, refreshed lifewhich was much needed after his unfortunate and painfully inaccurateportrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. If you love the action-packed Marvel universe but also crave a healthydose of humor and a surprising amount of heart, then search no more.This film satisfies on so many levels and the laughs will keep youcoming for more, time and again.
