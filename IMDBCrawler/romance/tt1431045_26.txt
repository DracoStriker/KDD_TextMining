Where will I get a hundred words to describe this "movie"? The story of this movie is basically a revenge story in a superheromovie, cliché. The reason for the success of this film is the type ofcharacter (which most Male audience in the age range between 16 and 25,will enjoy) coupled with spontaneous humor and the jokes with thefourth wall. Of course, the character may be a snort of fresh air forthe sub genre super heroes (I do not know there was a sub-genreso-called Super hero/ comic movie genre), but for the movies ingeneral, this here is nothing new to see. Do fans of this kind of movies feel down, when we talk about superheromovies and why do they have to separate them from the "other" types ofmovies? Just because they do not to offend sensitivities? Or they donot want the audience to consider them a "inferior movie", so manyquestions, no answer.Of course here we have all the ingredients that anyone in this rangewill like. Meaningless violence, even more so with super heroes.Seriously, how to create tension in a film of this type, where the maincharacter has regeneration and if he is cut into pieces, it willregenerate. The action scenes (the most basic element of this type offilm) completely lose their impact and tension. I like scenes of actionand violence, but the filmmakers have to show the effects of violenceon the bodies of characters and its consequences in characters' lives..Creating violence just to show that it is "cool" only creates moreviolent people. Even focusing solely on this aspect of the film, thefilm is too stupid. With senseless action scenes. This film, even itsmost primary purpose, can not perform with quality. In addition to the humorous, mindless action scenes, generic plot, themain character (fun but limited), what does this movie have to offer?Scenes of nudity, spare me. Do not waste your time with this tripe.
