Review by someone who is not a comic book fan.Deadpool is really funny and it is really meta-. It is not just meta-it is meta-meta; like the titular character says at one point, itdoesn't just break the proverbial fourth wall, but a wall within thatwall.Deadpool is also silly and it is fully aware of that silliness. It iswritten to feel like every choice in the script that remains faithfulto comic book hero conventions is a fully conscious and somewhat ironicone.That said, there's still a decent plot (barring the prettybasic/unremarkable bad guy) and, somehow, we can still feel for themain characters and root for their romance.Coming back to my review title: I think this is a comic book adaptationdone right. It's inventive, non-generic, and non-boring. With such anabundance of blockbuster adaptations nowadays, it's really hard to findone that stands out and doesn't just follow a recipe and the beatenpath. It's even harder to find one that will appeal to an audience thatlikes cinema without being particularly interested in comic books andwould like to see something more substantial than a generic actionmovie. I think the purely comedic and ironic take of Deadpool managesall that. I also think it's the only option to making great comic bookadaptations, other than the gritty, dark, and realistic style thatworks so well in "Logan".
