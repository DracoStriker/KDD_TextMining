Rating 8 out of 10? Spending 58 mil and reaping 363 mil? No wonder thiscountry voted for a clown to be their president (and this clown got acircus as a government to run this decadent society). We can tell abouta nation and its people by their cultural icons such as music, movies,arts, etc. Hollywood keeps on making these brain-dead violentblockbusters because of the herd mentality of this dumb-down generalpopulation. Same trend in the music industry...
