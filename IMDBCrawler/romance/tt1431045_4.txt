At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due toit being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits showup, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recentyears. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. Intypical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, inDeadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range fromthe serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody likefeel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather thensaving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superherofilm. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to thefantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plainsilly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 timesin my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placementswere well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is importantin understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nomineefor movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made
