This movie is by far the worse of anything that anyone can put out. Theplot was full of holes. The characters far from believable and theacting overall is what makes actors in the adult industry believe theycan actually cross over in to mainstream Hollywood. The jokes in thisare funny at first, but after hearing the same lame topics for awhileit gets tiring unless you are a teenager going through puberty withhormones all out of whack. Actually they would get tired of the jokes.The only people who would not are the really weird people that live intheir mom's basement at 40 plus years. The movie is more violent and has more profanity than other Marvelmovies, which does nothing to help or hinder the movie. It is theacting and writing that destroys this movie. Overall if you have notseen this movie consider yourself lucky, if you have like I have, andare divorced, like me, then be thankful for the movie. Watching it wasthe worse decision and not my taste in women.
