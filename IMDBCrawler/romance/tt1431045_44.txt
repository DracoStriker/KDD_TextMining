Maybe I'm not a Ryan Reynolds fan, but GAWD awful movie. What the hellwere they thinking? All the jokes were beyond cheesy and seemed forced.Not even a good story line either...the music was terrible. I left to clean my house throughout multiples times in the movie togive it a chance. I made it to the end , but it never got better .
