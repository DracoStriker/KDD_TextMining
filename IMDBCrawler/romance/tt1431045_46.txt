"Deadpool" can symbolize the beginning of a new age in cinema ? aglobal dumbing down of the moviegoers with violence and vulgarism ofthis so-called satire on superhero films.The film received positive reviews both from the critics and theaudiences alike what can raise doubts about authenticity of thesereviews and about the intellectual level of these so-called critics.One thing I agree with is that the director is an "overpaid tool" asthis is how he was credited in the titles.This film was supposed to be a parody of the superhero film, howeverthe jokes are not funny and needlessly vulgar, and is targeted towardsthe most primitive audience.The plot is stupid and full of pointless violent scenes. There is noaesthetic value of cinematography, nothing emotionally gripping and thewhole film is reminiscent of a bad joke played at the stupid audiencewho bought the ticket to such a trashy film.Somehow this film is a classic example of brainwashing of people,manipulating the most primitive instincts, appealing to the darksubconscious of the young and immature people. The film is toojuvenile, however it has a R-rating so it is not really clear whataudience it was made for.See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/
