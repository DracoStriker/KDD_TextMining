Even the very beginning of the film proves how good this movies. itstarts with a panning close up of a fight in a car while time isstopped with humorous mock credits are shown. This somewhat breaks thetone of what most generic action movies do. in which they would showthe fight scene in a time freeze while the opening credits go by andthen unfreeze to the action. but once again Deadpool surprises us byinstead of speeding up to create intensity it slows down and shows ataxi scene. the whole movie uses the generic action movie formula tocreate humorous by going against what that formulas expectation. thenon diegetic also plays into this since during action scenes it isslightly intense low sounding and fast tempo songs, but when deadpoolmakes a joke the music cuts and the one liner is made. the movie isusing what we expect of action super hero movies to its completeadvantage in order to make a total unique action movie like the antihero it stars
