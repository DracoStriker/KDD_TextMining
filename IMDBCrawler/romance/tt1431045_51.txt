Deadpool  (2016) This is superhero film based on the MarvelComics character of the same name. Our main character hunts the man whogave him mutant abilities, but also a scarred physical appearance. Thisis not your typical superhero film. Hence the 'R' rating. The violenceis cranked the up to John Wick levels. The language and sexual contentis not what you would expect out of a superhero. If you know the comic,you'll understand. But you don't need to know the comic or character tolove this film. The cast was fantastic. It includes RyanReynolds, Morena Baccarin, and T. J. Miller. The jokes are hilarious,sometimes juvenile, but utterly necessary to understand the character.This is by far my favorite superhero movie. It really blew me away. Istill can't conceive how much less it cost compared to other superheromovies. This is an absolute must see! Hell, I've seen it five times inless than a year.
