The actor who plays Deadpool or Wade Wilson, Ryan Reynolds, was a verygood choice. He did a great job portraying the character. Using hisever expanding arsenal of delicious snark. An operative turned,mercenary, turned cancer patient, turned medical experiment, thenturned Deadpool, constantly and only thinking about revenge to the onewho "cured" him. With his character talking directly to us it makes usa part of the movie. Throughout the movie you see many different typesof camera and lighting shot to set the mood of that scene. During thetime that they are shooting the scene when he is in the medical office,they are using low level lighting. At the end when they are shootingthe main fight scene at the end of the movie they are using a highlevel lighting. The lighting is another very helpful tool to set thevarious moods and different type of scene throughout the movie. Whenthey use the different camera angles, like in the beginning they usethe close up, this is the first time we see this. Later in the movieyou see the technique like when he's in the cab . The close up angle isused to portray a mood of seriousness. This movie was a very good movieand I'm am looking forward to the second movie coming out in 2018. Ifthe second movie is as good as the first one then that will make onegreat movie sequence.
