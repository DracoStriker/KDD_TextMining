OK so I think most us can agree the way that Ryan Reynolds plays anycharacter is brilliant and sunny no matter what he does. Ryan Reynoldswas casted perfectly for this role and I cant wait for Deadpool 2 tocome out next year. The only annoying thing about this film is therating attached to it. Unfortunately I wasn't able to go and see it inthe cinema so I had to instead wait until it came out on DVD to see itand I can honestly day that I was not disappointed with it. I waslaughing the entire way through the film. Partially because of the purecomedy and satire of the film but also because some of it is somewhatrelatable to. Deadpool in my mind has been a pretty underrated Marvelcharacter and now he finally has his own movie!!! I did think it waspretty late to bring out a film about him as in the comics he hasactually killed every character in the marvel universe including thewriters themselves. However this was a fun short story that Marvelproduced, but one the less. Back to the film though, it was amazing inevery aspect, both action and comedy it was equally balanced and thecasting for each and every member was perfectly picked, I have alreadywatched this at least two times.
