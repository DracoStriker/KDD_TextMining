I'll keep it short and simple. This movie is a hilarious and welcomedtwist to the super hero genre. People reviewing it 1 star out of 10 areacting like this movie kicked their dog into speeding traffic. Y'allneed to lighten up.The world could use more rated R super hero movies like Logan andDeadpool. Movies that aren't afraid to show the gritty side ofanti-heroes. I've watched many interviews and heard from many peopleonline that they think that this movie sticks very closely to it'ssource material, so those people complaining about the humor in themovie are probably just really complaining about a highly popular andestablished Marvel Comic.9 out of 10, easy.
