Incredibly funny and irreverent! There is no superhero movie like thisone and it really breaks the standards. It was a fun violent R-ratedcomedy.I have been waiting for a Deadpool movie ever since I heard of thecharacter. He's a brilliant, funny, self-referential,pop-culture-spewing enigma. This is why I thought getting a Deadpoolmovie franchise started would be difficult. To faithfully represent thecharacter, surely the fact that his origins are hazy, to say the least,should be touched upon? But, I suppose, coming up with a definitiveorigin story was a must, so I can forgive that. Everything else about the movie is as good as I thought it would be.Funny, irreverent, with a good dose of fighting and explosions.---Yidioo
