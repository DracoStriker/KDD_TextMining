This movie is terribly overrated. The plot was the same as every otherMarvel movie, only worse. It was supposed to be funny and cute but thejokes were juvenile and aimed at 12 year old boys. I don't know howanyone could laugh at it. 99% of the jokes were dick jokes and theyweren't even good ones. Aside from that, the plot was weak and so wasthe actual character of Deadpool. He was uninteresting and it wasimpossible to empathize with him or care about him at all. In fact, Ifound him to be more annoying than anything. The only part that waskindaaaa interesting was when he was being tortured but even that is astretch. Honestly, if you haven't seen it yet, don't bother, unless youhave a terrible taste in movies I guess. I can't understand whyeveryone LOVES this movie. It's annoying and not worth your time.
