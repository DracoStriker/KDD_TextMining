Fast funny and furious, summarizes well the three elements thatcombined in the right dose make this movie such a success. Fast --action packed at the right pace. Fun- Humour all over, witty humour,gross humour, cheeky humour, white humour, sexy humour, intellectualhumour, smart-ass humour, you name it, it is in there. Furious -violent to the extreme, no concessions to the sensitive stomach, butfunny violent if that can be said. The movie also has a great script,great characters, awesome dialogues, spectacular action scenes, amazingstaging and production, great tempo, crazy fun credits, a good ending,awesome music (just when it is needed) and the right length. The resultis one of those super-hero movies that will delight both super-heromovie fans and people who, like me, aren't usually into the genre orinto super-violent movies.Reynolds really shines in his role of Deadpool, because, in a way, hispersonal humour is that of Deadpool, and the character fits him like aglove. I honestly think that all actors are perfect in their respectiveroles, really well cast.It is really refreshing finding a super-hero movie that doesn't feelcookie-cuttered, that addresses adults with respect, a movie that feelsfresh and modern, that is not only entertaining but well filmed, wellacted and well-rounded overall -- a super-hero movie that is actuallyvery good.I'm looking forward to seeing the second installment. If it's as goodas this, I am buying a ticket to see it in a theater, not on DVD.
