I'm not a fan of comic books but I do like some of the films that areproduced from them like Iron Man, Captain America, and X-Men. I'venever heard of "Deadpool until I started seeing the trailers for thefilm. I didn't even know it was a Marvel comic. After seeing thetrailer for this film and the 8.5 rating it got on IMDb I thought I wasgoing to see one of those films I could kick back and watch the goodparts over and over again. That wasn't the case. "Deadpool" wasn't badbut it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. In the opening scene theaction was intense and riveting. I was hoping it remained like that allthroughout the film. Between the decent action scenes Deadpool (RyanReynolds) was just saying a lot of sarcastic and witty remarks, whichwas good for the film because I guess that's Deadpool's (Ryan Reynolds)personality, but it should have had some more hard hitting action toaccompany the sarcastic and witty remarks. Unlike other Marvel comicfilms "Deadpool" isn't for the whole family. It's crude, raunchy,violent, and full of sexual innuendos. So don't bring the kids to seethis one. As I said before it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be,comparing it to other Marvel comic films, but I'm not regretting thefact that I saw it either.
