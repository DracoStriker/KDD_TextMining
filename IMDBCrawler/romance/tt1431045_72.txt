I was honestly expecting the worst with this. I found the trailerssupremely annoying and a whole movie like that was going to drive me upthe wall. It still kind of is, but I was able to get into it. The storyis as generic as they come, but hey, it's a small, intimate story thatdoesn't try to be anything more than it is. I can appreciate that.It's funny how this is structured. It really doesn't need to do thewhole flashback thing, because they catch up to that point midwaythrough rather than at the end, but they wanted to start with an actionscene to grab you. I suppose it works.I'm finding it difficult to really write down what I think of this.It's certainly smugly satisfied with itself, but it's also charming ina weird way regarding the love story. About 10% of the jokes andreferences are worth a smirk, but when there's a handful of jokes orreferences every minute, that's a pretty high number of smirks, even afew laughs.But I can't fully get on board with this at the end. It's too standardand basic. The simplicity of the story can be boring. Pointing outflaws in other superhero movies doesn't negate the fact that your ownmovie succumbs to those flaws in an even more egregious fashion.I do need to give credit to Reynolds and the production team. Theydeserve props for bringing this to the screen and pleasing the die-hard fans.
