I didn't really find it funny, the humor seemed very gimmicky after awhile since a lot of the jokes are 4th wall bending. I didn't find itreally that clever. They put Deadpool through a lot in this movie andthey like to show his pain because I guess that would make the audiencefeel sympathetic towards our main character. However it doesn't reallyfeel uncomfortable for the viewer at any point. I would've liked it ifthey added some actual anguish, and not just Deadpool saying "this isterrible but I joke about it". Facing losing your life to cancer is hard enough in itself. I felt likethe film tried to get it more powerful and effective by piling more andmore things on to their character, but it's really how the charactersreact to a certain situation, not the severity of the situation itself.For the character they built and the amount of tragedy there supposedlyis, there is really not that much emotional reaction that they are ableto actually get out. It doesn't go very deep into the world that theyare in either, I didn't really get a fullness feeling out of it, sofourth wall breaks don't feel very outrageous at all.
