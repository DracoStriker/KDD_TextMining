Total waste of time. This movie was so bad that it's even difficult tocomment or think of where to begin.The description is also a bit misleading, it should say, A trash-talking, 2nd rate wannabe mercenary who thinks vulgarity ishumorous is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him withaccelerated healing powers and a quest for revenge due to a facialdeformation side effect.Constant unnecessary foul language and vulgar nonsense pre-teen typecomments from this empty headed non-hero loser is mostly responsiblefor turning a potentially decent move into nothing more than a trashypre-teen / teen film that teens aren't even supposed to watch, butmaybe that was the whole purpose of this waste of resources to beginwith, but then again even a pre-teen would find this movie "lame"!
