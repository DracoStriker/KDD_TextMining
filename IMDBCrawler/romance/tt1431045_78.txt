I have to say that this movie is one of the worse out there. It is zerostars for me. I am a fan of xmen and the marvel universe.I have seenall the movies, so I decided to watch this one based on the 8 starreview from the IMDb. The reason I was avoiding it is because I reallydid not like the character as it was presented in wolverine origins ( afilm I really enjoyed watching). The character should remain deadbecause he was awful. Not only they did not leave him there dead, theydecided to make a movie about him.This movie is supposed to be specialbecause he is an 'anti- hero'. Who cares? Of course the movie isspecial because it is absolutely garbage. No one should watch it. I cannot even explain how awful it is. How on earth this movie got 8 stars?I think the reviews are paid reviews. It does not make any sense. Icould not watch it until the end because it was hard for me. Pleasedon't watch it.
