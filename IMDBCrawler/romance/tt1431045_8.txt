Let me say at the very beginning of this review, I loathe super heromovies. I can not stress that point enough. For me, watching anyone ofthe countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios inthe name of entertainment over the past decade is, for me, akin tohaving teeth pulled. Painful to say the least. My friends however areaddicted to every single bombastic franchise, and through sufferance,I've endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet moreLycra-clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat (there areof course exceptions to the above; 'The Dark Knight', the original'X-Men)I was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watchingDeadpool would be an excellent waste of my time. I envisaged 15 minutesof feigned interest, followed by an hour 45 of updating my email andsome cheeky online shopping. Well that new Morphy Richards kettle andtoaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold, shockof all shocks, this film is bloody marvellous!! Bloody, hold yourknickers cause they are about to get blown off, marvellous!The dialogue is witty, sincere, and delivered by every single actorwith a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius,than drab scripted nonsense.The pacing of the movie is excellent. It held my interest through itsentirety.The actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned director.I was so pleased that for once, I was being forced to watch a moviethat treated me like an adult, with adult humour and themes, made foradults. Not for grown children masquerading as adults.This film is a perfect storm! Just everything is right! I look forward,to my great surprise to any squeals!
