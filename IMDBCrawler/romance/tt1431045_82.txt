The truth that sometimes scares me where the film goes, if it can becalled cinema to this. It seems that now we have to insult to be seen,we see it every day in other places, but that comes to this the filmseems very sad. We already had the heroes antiheroes but now they mustbe rude and unpleasant and thus they will get to the most stupendousgirl.Well let's not be surprised that kids on the street have no education.In terms of effects is, as not a wonder, except in some cases thatfalls short, it seems a lie.The picture is pretty good. The direction saved the moments of great 3das the titles of credit is very normal. That if at least it has boredme.I just hope this kind of films do not spread, otherwise we will get tosee this kind of people on the street.
