Nice try, attempting to breathe some fresh air into the worn-outsuper-hero genre... But it is too full of cute and witty one-liners.After a while, it gets repetitive and tiresome, like a 6-hour longstand-up comedy show with the same comedian. And the plot? Actually,there isn't one. You get a few grins here and there... and that's it.
