This is a self-satisfied, sexist little romp, with a few laughs and anaffable central performance from Ryan Reynolds, one of many Ben Affleckclones currently doing the Hollywood rounds. It amazes me that anyonecould possibly mistake it as in any way progressive. Its postmodern "Weknow we're in a movie"is as contemporary as a Bugs Bunny cartoon.Ed Skrein gives good villain, it's a treat to see Leslie Uggamsenjoying herself in a supporting role, and there's a nice sardonic turnfrom T.J. Miller. The music, by Junkie XL aka Tom Holkenborg, is, incontrast to the movie as a whole, unselfconsciously generic, and is allthe more enjoyable for it.DEADPOOL will pass slightly too much of your time. It could have beenshortened by ten minutes without anyone noticing. Otherwise, there'snot a lot to be said for it.
