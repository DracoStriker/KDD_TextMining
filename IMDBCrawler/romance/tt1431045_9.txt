I've said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect. There aren'tany movies that actually deserve a perfect score. But what if you werea dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too,and had already played the character once with horrible results wishedfor redemption? What if you wanted a comic book movie that would riseabove the whole PG-13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown intothese days? What character would be completely drowned in such a pool?Wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton, thoughhe did finally get unleashed with an R rated send off film (possiblypartly thanks to this movie). But Deadpool could never have been doneright in a PG-13 movie. The Merc with the Mouth had to have his lipssowed shut the first go round and after that... well... most fans wouldsay he was never truly Deadpool. Including the man who played him.Ryan Reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit ofplaying a real Deadpool. And boy does he. The R rating took the comicbook genre to a sparkly place I wish it would have gone to years ago.Oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and Reynolds nails it.Possibly thanks to the fact that he actually cared.But how good is it as a movie aside from all that? Well, I gave it aten. It might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasn't sospecial. It was the first R rated movie of its kind and it proved tothe people, and the studios, that it could be extremely successful evenwith that rating. Thank you Deadpool. You deserve an extra star forthat alone.
