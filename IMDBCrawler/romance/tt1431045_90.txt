Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvelmovies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially theX-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never readthe comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on myPlaystation. And I did think it was hilarious.The "wink wink" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but ifyou like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the openingtitles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally.He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is atestament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this,leaving behind the "shame" of being "green" (another Superhero heplayed, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you willfind many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokesguy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of thisanyway ...
