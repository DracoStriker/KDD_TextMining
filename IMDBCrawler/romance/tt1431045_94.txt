That's not an exaggeration. After the first 35 minutes I couldn't watchany more of it. So I jumped forward through most of the movie, watchedpart of the final fights, then fast fast fast forwarded through theend.The movie is full of rapid fire bad jokes, including lots of balljokes. The story is told in a back and forth between the present andflash back, with the last few minutes moving forward to the end. Theaction scenes are full of slow motion and freezes. Deadpool constantlytalks to the audience. It's bad movie making 101.The story is generic superhero origin - the bad guys give him superpowers while at the same time messing him up. He gets revenge.It might have been watchable if it had less of the bad jokes and astraight line story. A decent story may have helped, but the story wasgood enough for an action movie.It must be millennials, stoners, or more likely stoned millennials whowatched this movie to make it popular.
