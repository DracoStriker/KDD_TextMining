"Deadpool" is a tiresomely unfunny stab at making both a superheromovie that can compete with the best of that genre and a parody ofsuperhero movies that can also satirise them. It succeeds at neither.For a huge budget superhero flick, the plot and scenarios are just waytoo uninspired and boring. It has a pretty good opening action scene,but after that it has absolutely nothing you won't have seen before inany other recent comic book movie. As a parody, it just isn't funny,and all the nudge nudge wink wink moments get old in the first scene,and then continue all the way up to the inevitable after-credits-scene,which is just as unfunny as everything we've seen before it.It's the Seth MacFarlane school of anti-comedy. Didn't laugh the firsttime? Well, you're out of luck, because that joke will be repeatedobnoxiously throughout the rest of the run time.The movie also seems to think that name dropping everything pop-culturerelated is funny by default. You leave, probably unable to remember anactual gag, but maybe some of the relentless name dropping is stillwith you, because you've just heard it a million times. Reynolds, asDeadpool, even name-drops himself at one point, and not even that got alaugh.
