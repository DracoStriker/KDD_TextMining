The idea of making an R-rated superhero movie is good and I think itshould be a trend but this movie is not a very good example.A few scenes did make me laugh. I liked the action scenes.However, one problem I have with this movie was that it was trying toohard to be funny. Some of the humor was just ridiculous and very badtaste. Examples would be the scene where Ryan Reynolds farts and thescene close to the ending where Ryan Reynolds was lying next to hislover Vanessa as he was still fighting Ajax, he made a hole with hisfingers and stuck a finger in the hole as a sex joke. Also the sceneclose to the beginning of the film where Ryan Reynolds had a hole rightin the center of his ass on his suit was just childish.Another problem I had with this movie was that Ajax was just not aninteresting villain. He tortured Deadpool, fought him, kidnappedVanessa, fought Deadpool again, and then got shot in the head at theend. For a supervillain, Ajax didn't do much. And the movie neverexplained how Ajax got his super strength.My last issue with this movie is the fact that Deadpool was played byRyan Reynolds. He is like Jackie Chan, Danny Trejo, or Adam Sandler,you can't take those guys seriously, especially after Ryan Reynolds wasin that horrible Green Lantern film in 2011.Hopefully, the sequel will have better humor and villains.
