Crazy, stupid, love? The middle word aptly describes this ridiculousmovie. Steve Carell and the other cast members are completely unfunnyin this movie that purportedly is a comedy. The story is dreary andimplausible. Steve Carell's character is so unbelievable that no amountof literary license can make it plausible. When Steve Carell throwshimself out of a moving car, that sets the tone for this movie. Notonly is this movie not funny, the story is warped. It asks the audienceto accept certain premises that are not are not only untenable butdestroy whatever humor the story may contain. As a study of domesticdysfunctionality, the movie does better job, but frankly that is notsupposed to be the theme of the story. There is nothing funny about aman ejecting himself from a car after he learns that his wife wants adivorce and that his life has been turned upside down. That's tragic.If someone is expecting an amusing movie, prepare to be disappointed.The same can be said if you are expecting high drama. In fact, it mightbe best of you wait until the movie goes to DVD land.
