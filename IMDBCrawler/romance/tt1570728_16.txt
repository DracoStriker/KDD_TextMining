I went to see this upon reading the cast members...Marisa Tomei,Julianne Moore, Kevin Bacon, wow. But what a waste of talent for thesepeople, and a waste of time for me as well. The story felt very sloppy,and the characters were bland as a result. Steve Carell's role remindedme of his role in "40-yr-old virgin": nerdy middle-age guy with littlesexual experience. Sure he managed to be funny at parts but talk abouttypecast! Ryan Gosling's role meant to be a muscular dandy but came offas border-line homosexual. His upper body seemed to occupy an unhealthyamount of screen time. And one scene they put Steve Carell's face righton Ryan Gosling's groin area-what the hell was that all about? Oh andthe whole thing about the 17-yr-old babysitter taking naked photos ofherself for Cal(Steve Carell)-what?? How's that funny? It's ratherdisturbing! Julianne Moore's performance was kind of generic and Icouldn't take one more shot of her teary, blank stare. And I alsothought their kid (Jonah Bobo) was horrid! His character was the mostpainful to watch, following by Emma Stone. My! What a terrible actress.The total lack of depth of the film was astounding. Please can someonetell me what's the point of the story? I mean, really. I think it wasmade for people that are grown up on the outside but still 8-yr-olds onthe inside. For the real grown-ups, it might leave a bad taste in yourmouth, so be warned.
