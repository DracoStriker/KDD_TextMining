just the usual storyline..parents break up in the beginning and getback together at the end..but the things that happen in between makesthis movie a lot different, a lot better than other movies of samegenre.. the positives are the way they have treated this story line,the cast, their acting -steve carell keep this movie going and Ryangosling looks really stunning with his perfect abs..but the screenplaycud have been bit better..most of the scenes takes place in thebar..those thing make the movie go slower..and also the same oldclichés like mom cheating over dad, and dad getting back to the familyin a thought provoking, eye opening speech in the end are bitdramatic...but whatever said, if only the pace of the movie was goodthen this movie could have become one of the best movies in this genre
