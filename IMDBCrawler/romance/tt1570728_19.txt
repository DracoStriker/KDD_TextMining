So, I thought I would check out the state of the contemporary rom-com,and this seemed like a good bet. I mean, actors like Julianne Moore,Ryan Gosling, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei, how can you go wrong? Very,very wrong. What I got was one of the most appalling movies I haveseen in a long time, a sick demented number full of crazy stalkers,that entirely endorses and promotes stalker-ish behavior. Because, yousee, as long as YOU are convinced that the target is your "soul-mate,"it can't be considered stalking.Hello, Mr. Screenwriter! Have we forgotten that John Hinckley was fullyconvinced that Jodie Foster was his soul-mate? We know how that turnedout, correct? Ah, well, I guess we don't. So keep on pursuing your "romantic" thesis,and thanks for the details on 13-year-old boys masturbating and17-year-old girls taking nude pictures of themselves. You are keepingit real and contemporary! By the way, the answer to the burning question, What kind of dad hangsout at the same singles bars as his offspring? is, Creepy-as-Hell Dad! Apart from pointing out the descent into the moral pit that this movierepresents, I must also ruefully report that there is nothing of anyaesthetic interest or pleasure here. No sprightliness, no style, nocharm, not even such as might show up in the service of an entirelymisguided plot. Not a single shot worth looking at, not a single lineworth listening to. The characters are utterly boring, contourlessscreenwriter creations - no interests, no hobbies, no thoughts worthsharing, nada. No actors no matter how good could do anything with thismaterial.Steve Carell certainly cannot convince us that he could suddenly becomea swingin' SoCal ladies' man, effortlessly picking up women half hisage - and again, given the third act revelation here, it's a big yuckthat he would want to.Have fun.
