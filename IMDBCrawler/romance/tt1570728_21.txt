Once in a great while I watch a movie that I really enjoy... this isthat movie. The actors in this movie are great! Ryan Gosling is one ofmy favorite actors now. Prior to this I had only seen him in Drive, TheBeliever and Lars and the Real girl. Just on those 4 movies alone, talkabout a diverse spectrum of roles. The confident all around cool guy isthe role you would almost expect him to get type casted into, but thisis the first time I've seen him play that type of character. Comingfrom a hedro, he's one sexy bitch!!! Emma stone plays her same character, which I totally dig... and whynot, no ones better with the sarcasm then she is. Marisa Tomei isclassic in this movie. Hilarious!! For me it's the best role I've everseen her in. They must have been dying on the set, when she was bustingher stuff out. The movie is well written, the story line is nothing new, but neverdone this well. It's basically just a love triangle that comes to ahead. The message that the movie leaves us with is kind of lame andborderline stalker. Anyways, This is a great movie in any setting. Highly recommended!!!
