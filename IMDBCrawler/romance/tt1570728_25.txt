About 3/4 of the way through there's a scene which lasts about 2minutes that's actually funny and I think the audience laughed for thefirst time.The film up to that point plods it's way here, with a creepy sad plotand long, long silences to make this moment.The last 1/4 of the film is totally and utterly pointless and simplyattempts to resolve the story in a totally embarrassing andnon-humorous way.Honestly the people who wrote this film have no clue about what love is- it certainly isn't endlessly pursuing and stalking someone who saysno repeatedly.
