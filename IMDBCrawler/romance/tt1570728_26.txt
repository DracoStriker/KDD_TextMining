This film actually started out pretty good--Gosling, the ladies man,decides to help out Steve Carell,who is depressed over his wife leavinghim- -Gosling helps him improve his appearance and eventually Carell isconfident enough to pick up Marisa Tomei.But then it goes downhill, and that's putting it mildly--The film fellapart--One boring scene after another,thought it would never end.Not to mention any STD angle, or lack thereof: Gosling picks up everywoman in sight, and nerdy loser Carell admits to bagging 8 more womenafter Tomei--What is this, the 1970's? If you want some scary facts,look up the historical incidence of STD's in the USA--Herpes is oneexample: check the graph from 1967 to the present, up every singleyear--There were 15,000 monthly visits to doctors regarding herpes in1967--That number is now 350,000!! That's a twenty-fold increase inherpes since the late 1960's!and the twist ending sure didn't help anything, actually made itworse--Avoid this film
