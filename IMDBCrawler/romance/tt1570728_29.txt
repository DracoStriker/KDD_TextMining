Romantic comedies aren't usually my kind of thing but I thought thisfilm was great. The cast is strong (Gosling, Stone, Carell) which isthe main reason I chose to watch this film. It is quite a long film butthe plot is really clever. There is plenty of different things going onin the film and the way it all gets linked together is brilliant andcertainly something I did't see coming.There are some genuine laugh out loud moments and the film is straightto the point. The cast is great and all work together well, the plot isfresh and clever and it really was one of the best romantic comedies Ihave seen (haven't seen many but still) - Would recommend this film toanyone. 8/10
