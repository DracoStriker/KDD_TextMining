There are some pretty good redeeming qualities to this movie. There aresome true to life scenes. Overall the movie descends just underexcellent and stands just below the Descendants which was an easy 9star flick.Ryan Gosling stands out with an excellent performance as a womanizerwith style, class and a hint of humanity in his mentor ship to Carrol'scharacter.Some scenes seem to not be right for the movie and some seem to be madeto slide under a cookie cut like movie.Overall it is an above the fray movie and stands as a great watch and aworthy addition to any DVD collection.Definitely not a family movie as I wouldn't watch it with the kids dueto embarrassing and adult content but I might not be adverse to a teenwatching it.Enjoy!
