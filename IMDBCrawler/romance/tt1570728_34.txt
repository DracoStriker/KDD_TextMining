There is a moment (or two), where the movie is close to lose its way orget off its track. But it's only a momentary thing that will go awayalmost instantly. It manages to go through the clichés without hurtingitself. And while women might only be interested in Ryan Gosling (andwho can blame them?), there is more to the movie than that. It is rarethat a romantic comedy can be as good as this.And while other movies try to up the ante on raunchiness, this onealmost goes the opposite direction and does a great job in doing so.With Carell, Gosling, Stone, Moore and Tomei you have excellent actorswho can convey almost anything, if the material is right. And right itis! Even if the end feels a bit like a cheat, it gets away with it. Youwon't really mind ...
