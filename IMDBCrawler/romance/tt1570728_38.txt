Overall this is a terrible romantic comedy. But jokes and actingcarries you through.The plot is really stupid, and at times very unpleasant. Some willobject to the underage sex angle, some to the stalking, some to thewomanizing. What I found most grating was the idea of a sex-classsystem, where a girl should date someone not on her class level. Andthe story hinges on a girl dumping a guy for not realizing he is not onher level.On the plus side though, the acting is mostly solid, and there are alot of really funny moments scattered about. And I do like seeing awomanizer teach another without being a complete Barney Stinson copy.The ending though, Jesus... It is really bad.
