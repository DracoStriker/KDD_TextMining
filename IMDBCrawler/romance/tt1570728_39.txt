Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy in every way. It has a lovablecast and is packed full of clichés. When I say the cast is lovable, Imean it - Carell, Gosling, Stone, Tomei and Moore all bounce off thescreen and into our hearts. They're a talented bunch. Jonah Bobo droveme crazy, but I feel that his lines and story had more to do with that.But the cliché's are off the charts, and let me count the ways.-Zero-to-pick-up-artist romantic lead (40 Year Old Virgin - same actorand everything!) - Rich-but-doesn't-work-super-sexy-womaniser (think Barney Stinsonwithout a shade of originality by the filmmakers) - Reformed playaa (Wedding Crashers) - Super attractive female lead who we know won't end up with currentboyfriend because he's played by a no-name actor and the male lead hasalready appeared in the same scene as her (there's too many to list,but lets just use Spider-Man) - Crazy one-night stand personality and the awkwardness that ensues(Wedding Crashers) - Boorish and cringeworthy kid love story (ripped straight out of LoveActually, but a lot less cute) - Teenage girl obsessed with older man (think American Beauty) - Everyone gets closure and lives happily ever after (Love Actually)OK maybe my list of examples is limited, but I'm sure once you've seenone you've seen them all (certainly true of McConaughey and I'mstarting to suspect of Gosling too) By the end I was wincing in pain. Iwanted to like this, but I just cannot.
