In a world where Hollywood repeatedly churns out 'comedies' which areabout as amusing as bowel cancer, it does seem that Steve Carell isactually becoming as sure fire bet as you can get in the movie industryto be actually funny every time.Okay, so Crazy, Stupid, Love is not a laugh-a-minute fest, but, rightfrom the start, it raises a fair few chuckles. It's helped by having adecent cast. Although, I would say that everyone apart from Carellshould be described as 'supporting cast,' as all the best laughs aregenerated from him. He takes his 'loveable, but bumbling' characterwe're so used to seeing him as, and applies it here to his cringeworthyattempts at dating.Ryan Gosling is good too. However, he's merely Carell's straight manand the movie does slow down a bit in the second act when the storyfocuses more on Gosling over Carell.However, it picks up near the end, before ending how you've probablyguessed it would (assuming you've seen a romantic comedy before).All it all, some decent fun with a fair few adult situations and gags.Small criticism: might have benefited by being cut in length by abouttwenty minutes - just to tighten the comedy up and stop it dragging inplaces.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/
