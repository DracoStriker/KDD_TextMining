Crazy, Stupid, Love is a poise between perfect love and the perfectheartache. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's movie is toned with ablessing of an appealing cast and a catalogue of emotions, accompaniedby a sentimental description. The narrative is smart, counteracted bythe bizarre irrational, dealing with love cheats, the self-pitying andthe young and the wild. Steve Carell's role exploits the confusion ofthe male bearing. His wife Emily (Julianne Moore) declares herunfaithfulness due to her exasperated feelings of their long servingmarriage. Cal (Carell) moves out in an attempt to clear the air, or inhis case languish in his broodiness, wandering how his perfect suburbanmarriage crushed before his very eyes. Whilst in this fragile, yetsympathetic frame of mind he takes the time visiting a lustrous modernbar where he meets lady's man Jacob (Ryan Gosling). Jacob is a peoplewatcher, a male spectator, inviting his services to help a manrevitalise his sense of masculinity in an attempt to whisk the ladiesoff their feet and prize a night under the covers. Cal represents thetypical middle-aged male stereotype, a lack of fashion sense, appallinghairstyle and a list of terrible handbook jokes. With Jacob's tuitionCal sets out on an operation to tangle with as many women as possiblein a stab back at his unlawful and dishonest wife.The film's ending cunningly weaves all our lead characters together inan unexpected round up of commotion and revealing confessions. Althoughwe are familiar with Carell's usual role as the family sweetheart orthe exile trying to bind his way into the mainstream, his usualtemperament is recognised with mischievous tones that we adore him for.
