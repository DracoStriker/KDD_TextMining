Becoming a boring husband after 25 years of marriage, Cal is asked byhis wife (Emily) to divorce because she cheated on him with a workcolleague. From this moment, his life is about to take a dramatic turnwhich coincides with a new friend, Jacob. He will teach Cal how tobecome a real man, impressing women and asking them out in order tomake his wife regret her decision. All goes according to plan but Calisn't convinced he's doing the right thing so he slowly tries to comeback together with Emily. At the same time something strange happens toJacob. He gets "assaulted" by a girl with whom he falls in love andtries to become the man Cal was before the transformation.It's a puzzling story which follows dramatic changes of attitude fromlots of characters throughout this picture. Despite being aninteresting story, it gets boring more often than I can neglect andalthough it tries a lot to be funny, it doesn't actually manage most ofthe time. It's a good movie nevertheless but there were some momentswhich almost made me skip so I can't give it a better rating. Too bad!
