Usually, I'm not a huge fan of this rom-com genre. There are just toomany opportunities for films of this nature to go astray, from actingto story to ridiculousness. Fortunately, "Crazy Stupid Love" doesn'tfall prey to those traps and instead provides a tight, stylish, funny,and even moving production that appeals to a broad range ofmovie-watchers.For a basic plot summary, "Crazy Stupid Love" sees a middle-aged couple(played by Steve Carell & Julianne Moore) get a sudden divorce, shakingtheir family to the core. Concurrently, a suave love-guru (RyanGosling) takes Carell's sad-sack character and tries to turn him into aladies man, all the while pursuing a mysterious, fresh-faced girl (EmmaWatson) who is unlike any girl he has met before.The calling-card of this flick is its ability to carry multiple plotlines over the duration of the film until they all converge in the end.There is never a shortage of things going on, all related to thecentral concept of the "craziness of love".The acting has to be great for a movie like this to succeed, and thatis exactly what we get here. While all the actors are impressive intheir own right, it's their chemistry that really shines here. By theend, all of the major players have interacted with each other, and itall comes off seamlessly.The "polish" of this film is also impressive. Everything is just soslick, from the dialogue to the clothing and especially the young castmembers (Gosling & Stone, in particular). In short, this movie lacksnothing in the production-value department.Overall, then, "Crazy Stupid Love" is a film that can be enjoyed byteens on up for a variety of different reasons. I watched primarily forCarell's acting, but was quickly drawn in by the innocent beauty ofStone and the slickness of Gosling. I'm sure you'll find a reason to besucked in as well.
