"Crazy, Stupid, Love" begins like one of these typical Hollywoodcomedies. A couple that's about to divorce, a man exploring himself, adysfunctional family, nothing we haven't seen a thousand films aboutalready.And in a way it is one. It convinces through a massive cast, throwswith cheesy monologues and "Aw"-moments. But that's just half thestory. This movie is more. Not only is it actually quite funny, muchmore so than many of the comparable films, it also develops a veryintermingled plot that leads into a both absurd and beautiful ending.The characters are likable, maybe not very multidimensional, but stillsomewhat heart-warming. There are some pearls in the soundtrack andsmall gags in the right spots. Sure, there are also features that are abit too much the typical cinema release and in many ways, "Crazy,Stupid, Love" is not a very creative film.But nonetheless I really liked it. While I was still a bit unsureduring the first half, the second half could even increase the paste abit and entertained me just as I hoped for. Nothing to change your mindor worldview. But something to change your evening or mood maybe.
