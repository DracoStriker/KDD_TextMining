I am a big fan of the rare flower that is the original rom-com.Crazy,Stupid,Love is such a film, and it is remarkably well-roundedwith a cast that I would easily follow into much choppier waters thanthese.Ryan Gosling shines as the man he naturally looks to be, Emma Stone isdeliciously mature and naive at the same time. The best scenes in thefilm play out between these two highly-talented hotties.The mature pairing with Steve Carrel as the boring guy who's beenmarried too long is a trope I have seen before (by him), and while wellexecuted it is still not enough to rise above the cliché.The juniors in the film add an edge to the humor that is distinctlyuncomfortable at times, and the scene where conflict is to be found(I'm being vague for spoiler reasons) is far too convenient and feelsshoehorned in. Especially our main characters seem to step out of whatthey have been so far in order to push the plot forward. This is a brilliant film in many senses, yet lags in so many othersreally have trouble deciding if I like it or not - it is over- stuffedand at a run-time of two hours over-long...perhaps another viewing ismerited...oh JOY!
