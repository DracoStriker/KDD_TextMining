A man's wife leaves him and he has to start over in the dating world inmiddle age. So far, so 'Two and a Half Men'. This actually is a comedystarring Steve Carell, that people are rediscovering now, based on thefact that it stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, who have danced theirway into the public's hearts via 'La La Land'.It's a decent enough film. Quite why the review on the DVD box claimsit's better than 'Love Actually' I don't know, but it's amiable enough.My main problem with it is that it doesn't seem to know whether it'sgoing for heart-warming or lewd in terms of its humour. It flitsbetween the two and ends up being neither properly.A talented cast do their best with a so-so film.
