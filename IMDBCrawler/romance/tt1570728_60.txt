I admit, I would never have wanted to see this movie if it hadn't beenfor the amazing cast that caught my eye. Romantic comedy just isn't mykind of movie.What I Liked: The cast definitely made the movie worth watching. In fact, the filmwould have sucked without the likes of Steve Carell, Emma Stone, RyanGosling, Marisa Tomei and Julianne Moore. Carell's comic timing isexcellent, Stone and Gosling's chemistry beautifully on point, Mooreand Tomei's acting strongly committed to their characters. Theend/climax "fight/confrontation was the best thing about the movie. Itwas funny, busy, outrageous, and satisfying. I loved it.What I Didn't Like: Everything was watered-down; the comedy, in particular. As a whole, thefilm felt bland, very boring, and the cinematography was equally dulland lifeless. I was very bored until that end confrontation. I barelylaughed, I barely smiled, and I even considered turning the film off.It was boring. Just to bear in mind, this film was prompting all thewrong things: adultery, unhealthy fixation, sleeping with whoever youlike whenever you like, and it was, some times very much so, sexist. Anumber of times the attitude displayed from the men was "if you wantit, get it." More accurately, "if you want her, get her." Admittedly,it ended well with everyone realising their mistakes and changing thatoriginal attitude slightly. The adultery didn't win, nor did theplayboy lifestyle. Carell and Moore's characters reconciled, which wasa refreshing take on what you'd expect, and Gosling's character finallyrealised the error of his ways and started a healthy relationship withStone's character. Crazy, Stupid, Love was a twist on what you'd usually expect from astory like this, but to fully work it needed more humour and moreaction.
