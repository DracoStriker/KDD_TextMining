Crazy, Stupid, Love gets you laughing, cringing, involved andemotionally engrossed... And while it's busy getting all of that right,it hits you with a twist that's arguably Stupid, but it is so Crazy howthe directors hid it in plain sight that, you just have to Love it.Steve Carell I've always felt, is an actor that possesses many of thequalities I rarely ever admire in an actor, however, every time I seehim do what he does, I inexplicably respect him that little bit more.The plot is mainly around a couple named the Weavers, and fittingly,the subplots are so nicely woven in, that the final spouts' explosioncame together almost like soulmates.The cast is superb. Gosling's opening scene at the mall is so smooth,you can't wait to see what he's going to do for Cal's transformation.Carell is fun to watch throughout, and he doesn't drop the ball. Moore,Emma and Marisa are also a wonderful addition, to a script that does areally sterling job at mixing laughter, sadness, and drama, with asubtle, but nicely expressed sense of humility.This movie was crazy, a little stupid, and about love; and it did itall without being too excessive, and pretty well grounded.
