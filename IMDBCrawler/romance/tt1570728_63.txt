This movie is more like an ensemble piece, in which every couple has todeal with a certain pain to become ready for love. Usually it issugar-coated, these movies. And yes, it is not a deep- layeredstructure of in-depth character exposition. But somehow, between theeasy script lines, there is an unusual aspect in all of these peoplethat makes you being surprised. What aspect? Its honesty. Honestscript-writing. With that comes an undeniable fun that the actors have,when portraying their characters. And their love for their characterradiates on us.I have seen this movie many times and i can recommend you to beuplifted by it. We all need sometimes to be remembered that loveexists. But not the fairy tale-version..... What better advise then:love cannot breath without pain...?
