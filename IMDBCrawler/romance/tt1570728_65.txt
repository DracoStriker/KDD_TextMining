This movie probably looked good on paper (i.e. the screen play) but itlost its way in production with the blame spread around betweencasting, direction, and perhaps also editing. Mostly, I think what wasmissing, was creative vision by the director.Pros: Some tender moments. Several plot surprises. A few good laughs.Several commendable supporting role performances, most notably by: RyanGosling; Analeigh Tipton; and Jonah Bobo.Cons: Most of the plot was boring, with the entire first half of themovie being painful to sit through. There were far too many contrivedscenes, some of the more notably being parent teacher night,graduation, and the (cell) phone conversation about re-lighting theheater in the basement.Mixed: Casting was all over the place, some excellent choices, some notso much.
