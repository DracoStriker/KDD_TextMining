I usually cringe through these cheesy and dramatic moments but in thismovie I didn't I actually enjoyed many of them and that has to bebecause of the great acting and that I like these actors especiallyEmma stone and Steve Carrel. and the story is really well done,interesting and enjoyable with good twists. I had few laughs as wellthrough the movie so if you like romantic comedies you like this oneespecially that this is not a typical love story between two personsthat you know they will end up together besides the drama is reallywell done here. A great message is delivered through this movie as wellthat you will get to you without too much cringing .
