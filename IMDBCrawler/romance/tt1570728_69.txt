Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling AND Emma Stone all in one movie together?!First and foremost this movie has a fantastic cast. Ryan Gosling playswomaniser 'Jacob Palmer' who lives a lavish lifestyle picking up girlsat bars night after night, and one night in particular he meets CalWeaver (Steve Carell) who has just found out his wife has cheated onhim. Long story short, Jacob teaches Cal almost how to be a true man ifhe wants any chance at getting his wife back. After sleeping withseveral women, whilst also being on the fence with rekindling his lovewith his wife, Cal and Jacob form a light sort of 'bromance'. One issueI have with this movie is that some parts of the plot are all kinds ofmessed up. I mean, a 17 year old girl giving a 13 year old boy nudepictures of herself?! The first half of the narrative seems very slowand almost depressing but of course, being a romantic comedy, the moviehas an almost 'uplifting' and happy-ever-after ending. Nevertheless,this movie is hands down entertaining and really sets itself apart fromyour traditional rom-com. Worth a watch.
