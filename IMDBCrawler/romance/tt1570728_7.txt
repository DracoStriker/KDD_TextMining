I loved Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's "I Love You Philip Morris" butit must have been terribly frustrating for them, having to wait 2 yearsfor the release and then, not finding an audience in sufficientnumbers, not even with Jim Carrey. "Crazy Stupid Love" seems like atotally understanding attempt to go main stream and get the kind of boxoffice response that will allow them to go on. I think Ficarra andRequa are two enormous talents - remember their script for "Bad Santa?- the market needs made them do this silly, complacent, undercookedcomedy. Something so far away from what they've done before that I hopewe haven't lost them forever. I didn't believe for a minute thatJulianne Moore and Steve Carrell were a couple. I love Ryan Gosling butdidn't believe for a minute he will dedicate himself to the Carrellcharacter. And Carrell's outburst at his son's graduation seems amonumental miscalculation. What's great about stealing your own son'sthunder. I don't get Carrell, I must confess. I can't wait for him toplay a serial killer. That will get him an Oscar nomination. To makethings even more puzzling, Kevin Bacon plays a joke of a part and he'sphotographed without any regard. I'm puzzled and a little bit annoyed.
