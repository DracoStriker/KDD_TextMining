"Crazy, Stupid, Love." is a very known film for a reason that I don'thave any idea of. The characters are somehow interesting, but the castis just as hack as it could be, considering there's just no new actorat all. Therefore, as you can imagine, the movie as a whole is justanother merchandising for those actors whose performances are almostalways the same. Ryan Gosling, on the other hand, is someone I hadrarely heard of, and even thought he seems to be a copy of DavidArquette. Moreover, there isn't much to be said about this picture,since it didn't stay in my memory due to the uninteresting plot thathas been showed. Maybe "Crazy, Stupid, Love." is just another moviefrom the Hollywood that we'll hardly remember of.
