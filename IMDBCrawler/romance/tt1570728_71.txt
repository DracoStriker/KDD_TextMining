I was disappointed, maybe expectations was too high because of highratings. Almost nothing was funny. I find there are very few goodcomedies from Hollywood during last years, probably there are someproblems in this genre. To make a good comedy must be way harder thanchunks full of special effects. Another one dumb... I can't call itcomedy, a romantic film neither. Waste of your time. Nothing in thismovie was plausible. A middle aged man, who's wife is vice president insome company, wears dirty running NB shoes matched with too big suit athis office (and restaurant) and when he finds out his wife wantsdivorce throws himself out of running car. Then comes the Saver andhelps to get appropriate dress and the whole trite story begins. Reallyboring.
