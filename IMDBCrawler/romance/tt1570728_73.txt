Crazy, Stupid, Love is an above average romantic comedy thatsurprisingly manages to add something new to this perennially clichédgenre. The film features an ensemble cast comprising of immenselytalented actors like Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, RyanGosling and a few others. The insane plot gets a jolt when Emily (Julianne Moore) decides to geta divorce with Cal (Steve Carell) due to suffering a mid-life crisis.As Cal is heartbroken from the sudden development, he decides torediscover his manhood by learning how to pick up girls from Jacob(Ryan Gosling) who he meets at a bar. Now, there is a crazy scene near the end of the movie when all thecharacters get in a heated altercation after learning about the crushesthat have been developed by certain characters for each other. Ibelieve the final 15 minutes kind of ruin the movie as it involves acheesy scene in which Cal hints that he still loves his wife and wouldlove to have her back. After the sequence of events leading up to thisscene, it feels like the filmmakers could have given us a more offbeatending that would do justice to the overall tone of the movie. Apart from a few blemishes, most of the movie is hilarious due to somegood acting and intelligent dialog. A heart-warming tale epitomizes themain plot of Crazy, Stupid, Love. It is definitely worth a watch.
