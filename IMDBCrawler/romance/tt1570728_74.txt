This is a rom-com that tries to be a little different: so we have noless than seven relationships going on here; they involvedifferent-aged characters from middle-aged down to juvenile; and mostof them do not work out. Dan Fogelman - who has previously concentrated on screenplays foranimated movies - has produced a decent script and his words aredelivered by an attractive cast: Steve Carell and Julianne Mooreplaying a married couple who have broken up, Ryan Gosling and EmmaStone as young people trying to get it together, and Kevin Bacon andMarisa Tomei with smaller parts. It doesn't always work and is sometimes silly or schmaltzy, but it hasheart.
