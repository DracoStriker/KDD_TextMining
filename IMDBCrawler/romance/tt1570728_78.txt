This is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long time,it has the story, the characters, the jokes and a lot more.It is not just funny, it actually deals with a serious subject anddeals with it in a very good and mature way, and it delivers very well,I was very entertained all the way.The two main characters are acted out by Steve Carell and Ryan Goslingand they can really act, they both seem very into their character andare very convincing. They are really good together and there is a goodvibe in their acting, but also between the two characters.You should watch this, it should be on the 100 comedies to watch beforeyou die list :)
