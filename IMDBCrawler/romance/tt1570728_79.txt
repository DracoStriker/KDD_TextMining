Crazy Stupid Love is a 2011 comedy that has some funny scenes, someclever dialogue, and a charismatic cast, but suffers from a ramblingscreenplay that tries to encompass a little too much and takes way toolong to get where it's finally going.The film stars Steve Carell as Cal Weaver, a man rocked by theannouncement from his wife of 25 years, Emily (Julianne Moore) that shehas slept with a co-worker and wants a divorce. From there, the storyexpands into so many unexpected directions that it becomes a littledizzying to keep track of everything that's going on. It begins whenCal begins getting advice on getting back into the dating scene from aplayer named Jacob (Ryan Gosling) whose interest in helping Cal doesn'treally make any sense.Jacob eventually gets involved with a woman (Emma Stone) who only showsinterest in him after her co-worker/boyfriend (Josh Groban) breaks herheart. The story becomes even more complicated and murky as we finallylearn who Stone's character is, but by this time, we really don't carebecause to be honest, Gosling has more chemistry with Carell than hedoes with Stone. The storyline involving Cal's son and his babysitter also walks thefine line between good taste and perversion, despite a superbperformance from Jacob Bobo as the boy. But what this film does containat its heart is a vividly human performance from Steve Carell as Cal,an actor with a lovely Jack Lemmon-ish everyman quality whose merepresence on screen evokes immediate sympathy and the desire to put yourarm around him and tell him that everything is going to be all rightand he is well-matched by Moore, who brings a calming center to theinsanity that is the rest of the proceedings here. The screenplay iswell-intentioned but goes horribly off-course, despite an extremelylikable cast.
