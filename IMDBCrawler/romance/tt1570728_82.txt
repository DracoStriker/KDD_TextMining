Crazy, Stupid Love is one very funny romantic comedy that pokes fun atthe dating lifestyle and longtime marriages. Sub-plots involvingteenage love and jilted lovers create a tangle of funny complications.While the plot is contrived, the entertainment kept me laughing.Julianne Moore, Steve Carrell, and Ryan Gosling delivered in theirroles as well as Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon who get caught up in thefamily conflict. Steve Carell, as Cal, was the husband who reacted withthe cold, silent treatment when his wife and lifelong love, Emily(Julianne Moore), asked for a divorce. He then embarked on afreewheeling lifestyle with advice from Jacob, self-proclaimed datingexpert, played by Ryan Gosling. Marital problems lead to outside loveinterests that overlap families, neighbors and work associates. Themiddle of the movie sagged a bit but was redeemed by some very funnyscenes. All in all, a family situation fraught with a maze of hilariouscomplications.
