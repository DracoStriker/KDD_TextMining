This was really good for a rom-com, just different and edgy enough withsome really funny moments via Steve Carell alongside bittersweet truelife drama to make it work for me. There's also a great cast ofsecondary characters and damn Ryan Gosling... "photo-shopped." He playsprofessional bachelor Jacob Palmer who helps a newly separated Cal(Carell) navigate the singles scene after his wife (Julianne Moore)asks for a divorce and his perfect life crumbles.I laughed out loud several times here (the wallet while clothesshopping) and liked how this ended up being a totally different moviethan what it started out as. The last 20 minutes are just hilarious,including a big twist (I didn't see coming) and the fight. "Keep it inthe family okay?" 5/19/14
