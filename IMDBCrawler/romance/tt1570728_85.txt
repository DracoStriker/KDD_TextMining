If you ask me about the title I'll tell you that it was perfectlychosen. If you're the dreamy, romantic and hopeful type this is themovie for you. Not only you'll find what you love in it but it's soinspiring and gets you to believe in stuff like true love and happyendings. This kind of movie will get your heart to beat again and yoursoul to freshen up a little bit. I might be one of the brokenheartedpeople, one of those who drown in their thinking, who get high so fast.This movie had surprises; yeah there were quiet many happy ones.Although I didn't like the end so much but the whole movie was great.Especially when we figure out the girlfriend is the daughter and thehot buddy from the bar is the boyfriend's daughter and the hilariousscene when everyone gets in a fight. I can't tell which scene I prefer;the whole movie was a masterpiece. But what cracked me up so much isthe son, the lover boy who never gave up on his young love. I wish Ican find someone like that. The little actor was great probably myfavorite character from the whole thing. This is totally a movie toRe-watch again, again and again. I don't know why most people hate thistype of movies because simply you can expect the end or because it'ssimilar to every romantic comedy from anytime. All I can say to thispeople. That's my refuge, one and only. It gets you out of your skin;it's safe, happy and brings good energy. This type of movies brings thegood in human, the things that value most in life like love, life,family, friendship, passion;
