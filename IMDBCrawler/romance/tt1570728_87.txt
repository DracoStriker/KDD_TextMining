What can i say about Crazy, Stupid, Love except that it was Almostfantastic. The actor Steve Carol plays Cal Weaver a middle agedman,going through a tough divorce until Cal meets Jacob Palmer (RyanGosling) who plays a charming, mysterious, ladies man. Both roles wereperformed perfectly, which only helped highlight the magnificentstoryline.Throughout the movie we see it turn from a sad typical romance thatyou'd expect, to a surprising, great and highly laughable romancecomedy, which keeps us entertained until almost the very end.The end ruined it for me, if only the movie had ended a little soonerit would of been so much better everything up until the final ending isperfect. The ending for me turned this movie into what should of beenspectacular, to mediocre at best. The ending is what you'd expect fromevery other romance movie you've ever watched. Which for me just ruinedthis movie because, I thought it was more then just your typical chickflick romance.SPOILER! It's ruined for me when Robbie Weaver, Cals son gives his 8thgrade graduation speech and says how he thinks love is a scam, and asexpected Cal stands up in front of everyone gives a great big speechwins back his wife then Robbie re confesses his love (seen time andtime before) for Jessica and finally wins her over. Which is such atypical mediocre chick flick ending which in my opinion just wasn'tneeded if they cut that part out the movie would of been perfect.
