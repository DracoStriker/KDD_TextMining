Crazy Stupid Love was on TV last night and since it starred SteveCarrell(who I think is a somewhat good actor,I liked him in BruceAlmighty,he was hilarious in The 40 Year Old Virgin and he wasexcellent as Gru in Despicable Me franchise). The movie is about amiddle-aged man(Carrell)who's wife wants a divorce from him and so hetries to woo her again. So he hires this playboy ladies man (played byRyan Gosling,who I may add is hot in this without his shirt)and soGosling's charcther dresses Carrell up and tries to help him woo withthe women. He does however go on a date with Marisa Tomei's charctherwho happens to teach his son at school and problems arise however whereGosling falls for Emma Stone's charcther(who is later revealed asCarrell's daughter)and some babysitter is in love with Carrell andCarrell's son loves the babysitter that loves Carrell,basically its alla tangled up messy relationship that these charcthers develop from themovie.The comedy is slightly dry and its not as funny as lets say Dumb &Dumber or Rat Race for that matter,but if you are a fan of any of theactors in this movie than check it out. Once is enough to watch it orif you forgot what it was about you can check it out again.4/10
