Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) had an affair with David Lindhagen (KevinBacon), and she wants a divorce from Cal (Steve Carell). Meanwhiletheir babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) is in love with Cal, andtheir son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) is in love with Jessica. Jacob Palmer(Ryan Gosling) is a real ladies man, and he takes pity on Cal who'sbeen whining about his divorce to everybody in the bar. Jacob does amake-over on Cal, but he finds himself falling for the PG-13 Hannah(Emma Stone).I love everybody and every character in this movie. Carell and Goslinghave great comedic chemistry together. I love Gosling insulting Carell.I even love Julianne Moore who was cheating. Analeigh Tipton isadorable in her infatuation, and Jonah Bobo is even more adorable inhis. Ryan Gosling has a great dirty dancing bit with Emma Stone, andyes Emma is adorable too. In addition, there is a great scene withsupporting actress Marisa Tomei, and Liza Lapira has some great linesabout Conan. The only change I would make is to use the alternateending in the DVD.
