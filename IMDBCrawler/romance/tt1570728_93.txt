A huge cast (Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone,Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei) struggles mightily with a glib, pre-fabscreenplay by Dan Fogelman, packed with awkward situations that gonowhere. Each character seems to be prepared to espouse platitudes withthe utmost sincerity any time the script deems them appropriate, evenif credibility suffers, which it almost always does. With theexceptions of the agreeably smooth Gosling and the warm and wittyStone, everyone has done better work: they seem lost in all the talk;Carell, in particular, alters between cowering and manic but alwaysjust happens to be articulate enough to hammer home the literal pointsFogelman is intent on making. Overlong and unengaging.
