Crazy Stupid Love is a terrific movie with a very well developed plotand talented cast in terms of both comedy and drama. I was pleasantlysurprised with this movie, I thought it was going to be a typicalromantic comedy and only wanted to watch it because I am a fan of SteveCarell. It succeeded my expectations, while still being a hilariouscomedy, it has a lot of dramatic undertones, it is a very honest film,showcasing the difficulties of love.However, I would like to have seen Cal's relationship with Kate developmore, it was a pivotal moment as he begins his first connection with awoman following his separation from his wife. The chemistry betweenCarell and Marisa Tomei is stellar, sadly it does not last long onscreen. The cast are all fantastic and portray both the light and more intensemoments terrifically, the best part has to be when all the differentlove connections come together, it is interesting to see how much theyhave all messed up, and it is perfectly executed. Funny, sweet,emotional and somewhat depressing, Crazy Stupid Love goes by its title,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy. After separating from his wife of more than twenty years, Cal seekshelp from Jacob on how to pick up women. As his love life starts todevelop, Jacob starts to find real love for the first time. Best Performance: Steve Carell
