Like so many other movies I have seen, it started out great but endedweak. Gosling was perfect in his role and Carell was hilarious asalways. Emma Stone was also very good, and crazy hot. The problem I hadwas that the situations between everyone became more unbelievable asthe movie went on. But those situations, while not great, weren'tterrible either. The one thing I did have a major issue with was theson. Every time I saw him I wanted to slap him and shave his head.Maybe that is a little cruel for a child that can't act to save hislife and has an absurd haircut, but whatever. Still, if the movie hadwrapped up nicely it would have all been worth it. But the speech atthe end went from dumb to just plain ridiculous. And if what's herface's dad was mad before, I wonder how he will react to being thefather of a registered sex offender. You know, the polaroid deal. Imean, seriously!?!?!
