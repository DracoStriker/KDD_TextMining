The movie was delayed a year to hit the screen due to the copyrightissue. A biographical picture from Britain set in the late 1840. Themovie revolves the story of Euphemia Gray shortly known as Effie Grayand her married life. She was from Scotland and only 19 when shemarried to the British art critic John Ruskin. But she was kept undercertain limits of space by her laws. It makes her a lonely soul in thehouse, which surface a serious threat to their loveless marriage. Canit be held or not is the movie's final conclusion.Dakota Fanning, like I saw her yesterday in teen movies, but now she'sin a grown up movie. Felt kind of hard to accept, and then after awhile begin to like her performance. That does not mean it was apowerful act, somehow convincible to the viewers. That is mainlybecause of the story. Actually it's a simple story, if it was set inthe today's world. For those periods, it was a big affair to dealpublicly as well as family's prestige.The movie's settings and locations were good. As usual in a perioddrama the costumes are very good. It's always pleasure to learn thehistory through movies than the school textbooks. Other than that itwas an average or just above. The thing is, it was a too slow and alittle long movie, thus its not a commercial film. Many people aren'tready to pay watch it in the theatres, that is understood. So in myopinion, it should have been a television movie instead, with slicedinto 3-4 episodes. Anyway, not for everyone, but for those who loveslow presentations would have a good time.6/10
