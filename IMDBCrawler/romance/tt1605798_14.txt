A number of us tried to watch this movie together. None of us heard aword of the prologue because the music completely overwhelmed thespoken words. It was not quite as bad in the movie proper, but loudenough to interfere with our enjoyment of what would otherwise havebeen a very enjoyable movie with a fine script,great acting, etc. Ifthe music had been toned down we would have given it an 8.
