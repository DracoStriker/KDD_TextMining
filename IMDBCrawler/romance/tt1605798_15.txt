John Ruskin a famed social thinker, reformer, art critic and painterhas his character thrashed in this film. Ruskin when he was 29 yearsold married Effie Gray (Dakota Fanning) who was 19 years old. Not thatgreat an age difference but clearly Greg Wise as John Ruskin looks tooold and sadly too one note, then again his wife Emma Thompson wrote thescreenplay and also plays a supporting role as Lady Eastlake.We are given very little to go on as to why Ruskin would not consummatethe marriage, after all Effie is pretty which means either he wasturned off by the female body or was homosexual. It probably did nothelp that Ruskin chose to live with his parents who seemed to have aheavy influence on the adult Ruskin.Ruskin also encourages his wife to have a developing relationship withhis art protégé Everett Millais (Tom Sturridge) even if Millais at onepoint tells Ruskin how this would look to polite society.The film does not tell you that after the annulment, Effie marriedMillais and Ruskin never married again.This is a handsomely mounted leisurely paced film, there is somelocation filming in Venice but it is rather dreary, inert andconventional.Wise and Sturridge are not the strongest actors. Fanning though israther good, Derek Jacobi and James Fox are rather wasted in theircameos.
