Effie Gray (Dakota Fanning) is the eager teenage bride to prominent artacademic John Ruskin (Greg Wise). On the other hand, he is cold to heraffections. His unreasonably overprotective mother (Julie Walters)tells her to leave him alone to his work. He champions pre-Raphaelitepaintings and John Everett Millais (Tom Sturridge) in particular. SirCharles Eastlake is the president of the academy and his progressivewife (Emma Thompson) befriends Effie. Effie grows lonely in thestifling home and more attracted to Millais setting off a scandal inVictorian England.The first half is dull like John Ruskin. There are snippets of goodnessfrom Walters and Thompson. Fanning is captured by the costume drama.Sturridge starts to make himself known at the midpoint. The slow pacingreally kills this. Society has imprisoned Effie and the narrative hasimprisoned this movie. One way to empower Effie would be to make hermore compelling and more capable in the artistic world. Is John Ruskinsupposed to be closeted and can they make that part of the story? Thismovie needs something to energize it and spice it up.
