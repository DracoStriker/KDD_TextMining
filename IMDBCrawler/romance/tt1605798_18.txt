This movie is a beautiful story about a young woman and her failure tothrive when imprisoned as a house pet.I was surprised to read the negative reviews, but I believe they arewritten from people who do not accept the idea that women love sex,women want a full marriage, and a woman has a right to her own body.Those are very modern ideas! The women's revolution was a long timecoming in this world, and it's far from over. Most of history neverallowed her to have a voice. That is just the facts.I loved the way the movie was done and Dakota Fanning was perfect. EmmaThompson was superb, and she wrote it! Well done!
