As someone steeped in Pre-raphaelite history and having read many booksre the Effie Gray/Ruskin marriage I was interested in seeing this film.At first I was ready to dislike it based on inaccuracies like the factthat Millais paintings shown at the beginning, where Effie was themodel. were on display when the artist hadn't met her yet. I alsodisliked Julie Walters who was back doing Mrs Overall. However, after awhile I began to warm to it and although it was slow I enjoyed watchingit. My only criticism would be that the build up to a climax (more thanEffie got) was wasted as there should have been much more about thecourt case annulment and Effie's marriage to Millais. The masturbationscene was completely unnecessary and did not add to the film. I didwonder why Celestia Fox who was responsible for the casting, madeMillais look like everyone's idea of Rossetti and nothing like the babyfaced golden haired artist of fact. Greg Wise seems to be cornering themarket in cold, austere characters witness the reason TV productionOutcast, but he plays them well. I wasn't sure about Emma Thompson, shehas mannerisms that can be irritating. When the film ended I was leftfeeling that we were left hanging and anyone who knew nothing of thestory would have wondered what the point of the film was.
