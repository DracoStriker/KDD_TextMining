and definitely lacking in the shoot-em-up, bawdy gratuitous sex scenesand Hollywood hype. This is not a film for the usual popcorn viewingbrigade. Firstly, it is not (to it's enormous credit) a Hollywoodproduced film or even a big business film. It is privately funded andproduced. Now, viewers will find this very hard to believe, for theexcellence of scenery, costumes,attention to detail and cast role wouldcertainly infer my earlier statements to be incorrect. Additionally,superb cinematography and scene placement produce sumptuous delightsfor the eyes. Furthermore, Emma Thompson's script is a lesson on period dialoguegiven clarity and flow to a modern generation. This is a film that demands your attention but will not pander to it.If you are not willing to give your mind and heart to it, don't blamethe film. It's subtleties and nuances are exquisitely and delicatelyportrayed and I could find no area of the acting which in any waydispleased me.On the contrary. Now I will grant that I'm an old guy and that I can remember in mychildhood echoes of Edwardian-like darkened rooms and repressivelycollaborative furnishings, so there were echoes in the film Irecognised that many a viewer today would not find relevant (hence,perhaps, some of the comments on this board). But...and it's a pretty big BUT....to describe this film as anythingless than superb, a masterpiece, a true pageant of excellence in everydepartment...and done without major company backing...would be a grossmisrepresentation of film making.So, take that Hollywood!! Bam! Klash! Kaboom! So take that all youbigmoney film orgs! Kaboom. Good, indeed superb, films can be madewithout enormous expenditure and excessive hype. This is one ofthem.(but don't watch it if you only want to defend Ruskin or suppressthe indomitable spirit of womanhood).
