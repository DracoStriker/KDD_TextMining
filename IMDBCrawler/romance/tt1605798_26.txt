In some places billed as a story of a terrible scandal, the film failsto deliver on that promise in any way. The 'facts' of the story thatare on display in this film are all those that may have led up toscandal, but nothing here tells of what happened when (if) it broke!Lit as if it all took place in midwinter in the half light, I can onlyguess at the costumes and the sets as mostly o just saw pale faces in asea of shadows. It is very slowly plotted, taking at least 30 minutesto get going, and the music drags it down even further into dullness,but the real shame of the film is its failure to make any real attemptto understand anyone except Effie herself. If the allegations the filmmakes are true (e.g. Mrs Ruskin senior was a poisoner) it's somethingthat deserves more than the cardboard cutout that Julie Walters wasgiven to play by way of an explanation. One expects licence in a 'basedon a real life story' story (!) but it had the feel of a few bare factsknitted together with 90% fiction, which is a strange mix. I confess tonot knowing how much was true and how much was Emma's own imagination,but it certainly felt like Victoria n morality and mores crudely putthrough the mincer of modern ideas. Badly done Emma, badly done!
