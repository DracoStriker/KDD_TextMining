Oh Emma what a major disappointment! You didn't even bother to add sometext at the end to say what happened to Effie. She went on to marryMillais and had several children with him and by all accounts livedhappily ever after. The Scotland scenes were slow and boring though therest was OK. certainly the TV series Desperate Romantics re the pre-Raphaelites was far more dramatic re Effie and Millais. It will beinteresting to find out which was the real situation. Such a pity - theacting was OK and the costumes beautiful. The lighting was really weirdthough- going from dimmish to really dim in the same scene- if that wassupposed to be some sort of filmic effect it failed. It made me thinkthere was something wrong with my TV. I was also disappointed with thesound quality nod several times thought they were speaking in a foreignlanguage - and I don't mean the scenes shot in Venice either!For people who know nothing about the Ruskin/ Effie/ Millais situation,which was a very unique, scandalous and shocking situation that madeRuskin a laughing stock, it failed miserably. If you are going to pluckstuff from history it really needs to be far more accurate.
