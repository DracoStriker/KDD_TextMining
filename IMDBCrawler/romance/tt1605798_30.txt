In some of the worst writing and directing I've ever seen, an hour anda half is spent telling a five minute story! Make no mistake, there isno love triangle exhibited here, no love making at all and no affair.The summary of the story given is a lie. I am big Dakota Fanning fan,which is why I chose this movie but I couldn't be more disappointed. Itwas very difficult not to stop watching mid way through. Emma Thompsonis an actor of legendary caliber, but this screenplay is attributed toher and it is absolutely terrible! Everyone involved in the making ofthis film should be ashamed! I tried very hard to find some redeemingvalue in this film, but there is none.
