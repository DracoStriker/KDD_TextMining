This is a film treated with the delicacy that the real circumstancesmust have required. Effie Gray, based on the true story of a teenagerwho marries John Ruskin (grown man and well-known author), comes torealize that she and her husband have varying expectations of marriage.She slowly begins to fade away as she makes all appearances offollowing the rules of her new, married life.The movie is well-paced, quiet, and stylistically appropriate. DakotaFanning does a wonderful job of portraying Effie's quiet despair, andyou do forget that she is an American actor (her accent is good). DerekJacobi makes a guest turn, towards the end, and, It's always a pleasureto see Emma Thompson in anything, let alone in a vehicle for ascreenplay that she has written.Well worth seeing.
