I'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen itall before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowdedfor it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserveit. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being setin a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it isnever stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, ittries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters.Joan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERYend of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spendmost of the time thinking "I thought Joan Cussack was in this?" But Iguess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know JoanCussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh,and wasn't alive in 1990.
