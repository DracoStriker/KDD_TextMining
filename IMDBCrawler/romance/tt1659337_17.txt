Even though all the actors are great and talented, it's merely an okaymovie that will kind of hold your attention...A little context: I just finished watching all of The Inbetweeners (UK)and absolutely loved it. One of the funniest yet relatable shows aboutbeing a teenager (specifically a boy) I've ever seen. I almost diedlaughing. The main character (Will) created just as many problems forhimself as the world around him.Perks suffers from a main character who's too benign. He's depressedand introverted because he's getting over the death of his suicidalbest friend... And the death of his favourite aunt. Just pick one andgo with it.The script just reads like a generic film school outcast drama. Lots oftropes. I was confused about what time period this took place in. Iassume it's contemporary but for some reason these teenagers are makingmix cassette tapes and own record players instead of cell phones. Thewriters are trying too hard to make them quirky and lovable but none ofit rings true. They pick one emotion (angst) and really run with it.There's a lot of stock-movie-bullying we've seen before, tripping thedork in the cafeteria, ruining someone's books etc. the teens justaren't written like teens. Real teens are more devious.The movie started to liven up with some humour when Charlieinadvertently became some chick's boyfriend but it doesn't last long. Isuppose the book has a large following but I'm speaking as someone whodidn't read it and am coming into this with no preconceptions about thecharacters.
