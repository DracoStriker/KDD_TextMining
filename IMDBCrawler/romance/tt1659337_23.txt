Movies like this are a disservice to real life kids in actual highschool today. No manic pixie dream girl (and her inclusive sidekick)really exist, certainly not in high school, and no unsuspecting nerd isgoing to be swept up into a whirlwind of acceptance and parties andlove affairs. If this movie weren't about something people everywhere,throughout all time, ever didn't experience for themselves, maybe itwould be entertaining. But they do. So it's just insultinglysaccharine. This movie should be categorized under fantasy, it'scertainly not relatable for kids, I think it only really serves as aguidebook for the MPDG wannabe's. IE: it's tripe. Thank goodness Ididn't see this while I was actually in high school and actuallystruggling or this would have made me feel worse.
