American high-school movies. Yes another one. In tackling the pitfallsand plateaus of adolescence, many films have fallen along the bad sideof cliché, however it's important to remember that like every genre(well, nearly) it has had its successes; for me, John Hughes seminalThe Breakfast Club instantly springs to mind, along with others such asPretty in Pink, Mean Girls and Clueless. Fortunately, The Perks ofBeing a Wallflower takes a decent stab at falling into the samecategory as these films; and while it doesn't scale to their heights,it's a surprisingly likable coming-of-age drama.Based on Stephen Chbosky's 1999 bestseller on the same name (he alsowrites and directs here), the film concerns freshman Charlie (LoganLerman) as he experiences difficulty at home and school. However, hefalls in with a group of seniors, including Patrick (Ezra Miller) andSam (Emma Watson), who show him what is to be a "wallflower". Heencounters depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, homophobia, love,heartbreak, David Bowie and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.I was sincerely taken aback by the fact that Charlie did not annoy me;too many high-school films and TV shows nowadays centre of smart-mouthed, wiser-than-their years teens, so it was refreshing to have onerelatable and natural. This is mainly due to Lerman who delivers asincere and engaging performance. While Emma Watson shows clearevidence of a career beyond Potter. However, it's Miller who's thestandout; after holding his own with the brilliant Tilda Swinton in WeNeed to Talk About Kevin, he doesn't disappoint, despite being saddledwith the 'flamboyant gay best friend' role.Chbosky's direction is nothing to marvel at and the script not one ofthe year's best, but overall, to quote South Park's Deapartment ofInterior Security Guy, it's "fine, just fine". A sweet, enjoyable andhonest look at those years we'll never forget.
