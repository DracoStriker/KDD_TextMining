It was a very well made movie, i started watching the Movie & read thebook which i finished in 5hrz. i was into it perhaps the movie made mewanna read the book more. It a really interesting way of writing abook. I'd encourage for anyone to read the book & Watch the movie. Ithought Emma Watson looked really good, Hot even & I loved Loganhere...Ezra was just good, great even.It hurt because i found relations to it, perhaps that's why i cried.that moment when Sam (Emma Watson) touches Charlie's lap (Logan Lerman)with that look in his eyes i knew something was wrong & i cried.Some of the songs are a good pick, some are just Duh!Asleep by The Smiths (Oh Lovely track)Love always JC
