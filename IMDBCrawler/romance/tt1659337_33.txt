Nirvana had it right. This film, set in the grunge heyday, was full ofthe teenage angst that sells films and albums, but that leaves a emptyspace when life moves on. Sure, it is an interesting coming of agestory, but I am bored with it's redundancies. Not much has changed fromthen to now so there is not so much a kudos on it being a period piece,as many reviews had suggested, and in the places where it should haveshown a difference in that age and this, it was not so accurate. Also,as much as I love Emma Watson, she seemed timid and her American accentwas flimsy. The best part of this film was the character of Patrick,which is a given. The book seemed so much more profound when I read itin my teens, but I can't say if it is the story that had changed forthe film, or just me changing with age.
