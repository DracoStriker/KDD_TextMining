Frankly I didn't expect too much from this entry; I've never heard ofthe book let alone read it, I'm not really a Harry Potter buff so I hadno interest in whether or not Emma Watson would not out to havediscovered Life Beyond Harry Potter. At most I was hoping for apainlessly pleasant couple of hours in the dark. Having seen it I haveno problem endorsing the positive reviews I have just been reading hereon IMDb. Whilst I don't know how realistic it would be to have afreshman hanging out with Seniors for one whole Academic year thethought merely registered rather than nagged throughout the runningtime. There was one subtle touch I appreciated: Charley establishes animmediate rapport with his English teacher who is happy to suggest -and even supply - 'extra' reading for Charley, who laps it up. At onepoint the teacher makes Charley a present of his own 'personal' copy of'The Catcher In The Rye'. This novel is narrated by a troubled teenagerwho reveals in the last chapter that he is writing from a hospitalwhere he is being treated for a nervous breakdown; 'Wallflower' is alsonarrated by Charley who begins by telling us he has spent some time inhospital and we soon realize this his ailment wasn't physical. Nicetouch. This is very much an ensemble piece, to say nothing of a laborof love, and it would be churlish to single out any one performance. Myonly reservation is that, like so many 'indie' movies that are socharming on a first viewing - Sideways, The Station Agent, Juno, etc -it may not hold up in a few years time. But for now it is slightlyterrific.
