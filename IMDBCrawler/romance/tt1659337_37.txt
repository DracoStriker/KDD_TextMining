Let's get right into the nitty-gritty. It has terribly wooden acting, ashallow and basic script that is wholly reliant on jump-cuts to fill inthe gaping, disjointed gaps, and an agenda-pushing narrative thatimplies feminine men and dominant women in a relationship is a goodthing: as biologically insane as that is. No doubt, 'liberal' peoplewill be 'offended' by this; but the truth is unalterable, it's time tosee this film for what it is; a facet of the big-moneyRothschild-funded neo-feminist movement that is seriously damaging thecongruity of organic society, it has the front-runner feminist Watsonin it for Christ's sake. 'Charlie' (Logan Lermon, or something likethat) develops rather barely as a character, by the end of the film hehasn't changed a notch, and to be quite honest I never resonated withhim as a character. His buddy, whatnot, can't recall his name, ah yeah- Patrick, was nicely acted, and some other characters were decent aswell. It had a basic plot that failed to captivate an audience thatisn't new- wave millennial, pre-pubescent teenage girls. The end, avoidlike the plague.
