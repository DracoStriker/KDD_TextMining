Let's make it clear from the beginning: I'm a big fan of this movie sothis review may be a little bit biased, but aren't them all? I havewatched this movie twice, the first time was when it was still intheaters and the second time was 1 hour ago. I have experienced thesame joy at both times, this is rare enough to underline it. This moviejust amazes me.As far as I'm concerned it has everything in it, well every good thingyou could expect from a movie. It has, of course, a love story, atroubled main character, a high school as a decor, at the first sightit looks like another teen movie. I can assure you: it is not! It hasso much to offer to you, I bet you're going to think about this moviefor a while after you've watched it. I know I did. Well enough for anintroduction, let's get into it.You've surely read the summary already, if not go ahead and read it.This movie is about a boy who just entered high school. He had someproblems in the past and he's hoping to get past it. His first days ofschool don't go too well until he meets Patrick and Sam, two peculiarpeople. Even though they're in last year and Charlie is still afreshman they accept him in their group of friends. I won't spoil youanymore.This movie is based on a book that I read after the first time I sawit. The writer of the book is the director of the movie and this is sogreat I couldn't emphasize this more. The movie has almost everythingfrom the book in it and it is all sheer marvel. It explains so trulyhow high school is without cliché and the character of Charlie isreally well written. I've also had some problems in life, I guesseverybody had, and I've recognized myself so many times in Charlie itjust makes the movie more grandiose. Then you've got Sam who is justbeautiful and makes you want to kiss her all the time. This moviereally brings me powerful emotions. I will not go through every singlecharacter, I hope this review has made you want to see this movie. Goand watch it then!Enjoy!
