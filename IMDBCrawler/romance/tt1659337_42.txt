"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" is a good movie. However, as a fatherof two girls in college, watching this film is a bit tough for me, as IWANT to assume that real young people don't do drugs, stand up infast-moving cars, have sex, or, well...have sex. But I also know thisnaive and although I would hate for younger teens to see this movie (asit might give them a sense that they should grow up too fast), it IS agood film. Far from perfect,...but a good film.The film is about a very insecure and withdrawn young man entering highschool. He doesn't fit in and knows it. However, surprisingly, he doessoon get taken into a small group of friends--friends who are seniorsand mostly have a lot of hangups too. It takes place over this singleyear of high school and ends when the older friends go off to college.The film has a very smart script. Sometime, perhaps a bit too smartbecause too often the kids come off as a bit hipster-ish and too glib.But it is very enjoyable throughout and quite poignant--and deals withsome VERY tough and complex topics--some of which are rarely everaddressed. While I don't think the movie is as wonderful as most (sinceit's in the IMDb Top 250 List), it is quite good and excellent for anaudience 16 and up...well, perhaps 17 and up.
