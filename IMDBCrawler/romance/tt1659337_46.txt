This is my first review and its brief. I do not understand the need forlengthy reviews. After watching this four times in six days i feltcompelled to give my own ten pence worth. I've never seen a film likethis where i have loved all the characters. The cast are brilliant andstory moves along at a nice pace. The soundtrack is amazing. I lovemovies and its very rare that one comes along like this that works onso many levels. I am not usually one for this sort of genre and cameclose to taking this back before actually watching it. I am so glad idid not. Its going to be a very long time before something tops this.This is a feel good movie with some disturbing undertones. If you lovemovies and want something that moves you emotionally then this is foryou.
