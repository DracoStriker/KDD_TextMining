1) You are the author of the novel / writer of the screenplay /director of the film / real life teenage sufferer as described in thestory. The events are your life, thus boring or not boring, you love tosee them translated on the screen.2) You are a teenager yourself, going through a time which might besimilar to the one experienced by any of the protagonists, so you feelyourself identified with their story. In any of the two previous cases, you probably think this movie is amasterpiece. If nothing of the above applies, you might think as I do: This is amovie with great performances, but the story is absolutely flat andextremely predictable with huge clichés as main characters. It feelsthey have used the same pattern as in any other "coming of age story".The only thing which is not that predictable (all the mental issuesplot which I won't discuss here to keep this spoiler free) is veryoverlooked by the main story, and when it gets into it, it gets atreatment very in a rush, as if the writer didn't think it's soimportant. And by the way, the image of teenagers listening to "The Smiths" andstating how great taste in music they have, not listening to othermainstream garbage, is already a parody. In fact, when "The Smiths"name was said for the first time in this movie, I couldn't avoidlaughing. I will stay away from upcoming coming of age stories, unless they proveto be more original and don't use so many clichés.And for the writers out there: Nobody cares about how much you sufferedin high school... except people going through high school, so I guessyou can understand how people outside high school is not veryinterested in what you have to say.
