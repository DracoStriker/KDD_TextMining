Yet another movie that I am baffled by the rating and positiveresponse. The acting is very awkward and forced. Logan does a prettygood job... he didn't talk a whole lot. He would just say his one lineand looks would be exchanged and then end scene. Emma's accent washorrendous. I swear there were moments of actually pauses and silencein her scenes because the three actors must not have spent enough timetogether because their friendship didn't seem real at all. I hate whenmovies have to cram all these scenes from the book into a short movie,it hardly ever works out for the fans. I just wanted MORE from it! Ididn't get that deep emotional feeling I got from reading the book.
