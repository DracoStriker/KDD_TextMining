This film has changed my life, if I could compare myself with a movieit was this. Sometimes you feel bad, sometimes good,but when I watchthis film gives me a sense of relief again. Every time I cry atdifferent times. I help myself with it to let go emotionally. I reallyloved the book, but the characters were so perfect for each roll.Sometimes i wish i could have friends or even someone that share themind of me. ( with this movie and the feeling i got when i watch it.and also why i watch it ( and so much ) it really hits me every time.it makes me feel so much at once. my favorite movie.I am proud to be a wallflower.
