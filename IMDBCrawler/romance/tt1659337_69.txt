It doesn't sound like a promising title but it turns out that it's asurprisingly engaging and charming film. The film occasionally lapses into narration which is probably the onlyminor irritation. I understand that the original book of the same nameuse a letter writing device and I suspect that the film makers wererather too fond of the idea. The three central characters play their characters very well anddeserve the cabinet full of awards they have won between them. EmmaWatson, being the best know, probably has a harder job but pulls it offwith the aplomb of a true professional. It's nice to see the gay character of Patrick (Ezra Miller) beingportrayed in a positive light and challenging issues of mental healthand suicide being handled in a direct but sensitive way. A quality production definitely worth multiple views.
