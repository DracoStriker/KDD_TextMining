I saw the preview of this film and thought it was intriguing. I went toa screening last week and was totally BLOWN AWAY......this film haseverything. I grew up in this era were the internet highway was justabout to expload and I felt this film had EVERYTHING -great beginning =grabbed your attention, then acceptance, then the complex happened andyou just didn't know where this film was going to go and then the filmclosure or was it? This has to be the BEST DRAMA/LOVE STORY ....comingof age I have seen. I would recommend this film to ANYONE....LOVED IT!!!!!! PLEASE go see this film. I feel due to lack of advertisementthat it will be overlooked with other big blockbuster films but Itotally related to this film and LOVED IT !!! I haven't even heardabout this film until I was invited to a screening...saw the trailerand really wanted to see it but the trailer does not do it justice. Ifyou are looking for something to do on a weekend ...get out of theheat..please see this film
