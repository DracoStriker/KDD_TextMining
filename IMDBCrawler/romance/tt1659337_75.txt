There are few films that I can say that I truly got lost in. Ones whereI was so engrossed that I felt like I was actually living the story andalong with the emotional roller coaster 100%. This was one of thosefilms.I have to say that I normally don't watch a lot of films like this. Imostly go for action/comedy/adventure/fantasy type films. Yup, I likepopcorn flicks. But I decided to give this a shot because I recentlywatched the Harry Potter films for the first time (yes, I know) andkind of became infatuated with Emma Watson.Wow, this film was memorizing. I got so attached to the characters, andcared about their lives and wanted them to be happy. I also did notexpect all the heavy themes. This not your typical teen/high schoolrelationship flick but that's a good thing. I actually cried multipletimes throughout the film, and I think that is a token to how well thestory was weaved and how genuine the characters were - and also howgood the acting was.In the end I'm sure my review won't make a difference among the 500other reviews, but I feel like I had to leave one anyway because ittouched me so much and I'm sure I'll still be affected by it long afterviewing.
