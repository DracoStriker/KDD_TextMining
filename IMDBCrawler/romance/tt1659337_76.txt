Many who watch this movie are in love with this movie, judging by itsratings and reviews, however I did not find it very memorable. Perhapsthis is because the main character annoys me. Looking back on highschool I realise how difficult children and teens make it out to behowever I think it is probably more difficult to not make any friendsthan it is to make friends. When he decides to bravely go and sit nextto Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) he was easily accepted and Patrickwelcomed him with open arms. I also find many of these characters veryflamboyant and theatrical and the friendships seemed a little bit fakeand only seen in movies.On the alternative, I do feel this movie is capable of giving hope tomany teenagers. Many feel alone and introverted at school and thismovie shows that it is not difficult to make friends at school, howeverdo not mess it up like he does at one point in the movie. Other lessonswe gain from this film is to follow your heart, however the fact thatmovies always portray a happy ending to love stories is not always thecase in real life and therefore need to be careful.Even though I felt Patrick was very over the top and a very rarecharacter to find in real life, I loved him. I loved the care freeattitude he had, his confidence he had in himself and the advice hegives main actor Charlie. Patrick is a homosexual this movie portrays astereotypical way gays act. I do feel that it was necessary to portrayhim this way as we love Patrick in this movie and perhaps society willsubconsciously start accepting gays more into society.
