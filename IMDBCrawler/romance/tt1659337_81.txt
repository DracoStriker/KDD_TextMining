Since I was also a "coming of age" at guy at one point in my life, Icould relate to "The Perks of Being A Wallflower"'s story, and even ifyou are older or younger, you will still feel that you are part of thismovie. Filled with hilarious moments with plenty of emotional drama aswell, this movie has certainly balanced the scale well and the talentedChbosky (who wrote the book, and also directed AND wrote the script)deserves a standing ovation. The casting officials (Venus Kanani andMary Vernieu) have done a great job including Logan Lerman- a verytalented young actor- and Watson, who's American accent I thought wasquite good for a British born woman who spent half her life doing avery British series- Harry Potter. Also, Ezra Miller was, in myopinion, the best actor in the movie. He added that little spark to itwhich gave it a rich and unique taste. I had never heard of Millerbefore, and I'm sure he will go on to do other great movies in hiscareer. The music used throughout the movie was just fantastic. Isometimes say that the right background music and soundtrack cansometimes MAKE the movie what it is, and including David Bowie's"Heroes" truly did so. Overall- A fun and enjoying movie to watch :)
