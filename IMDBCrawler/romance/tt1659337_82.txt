I wasn't ready for this, when this film was released i expectedsomething like Juno and i didn't want to watch it. I was so wrong! Thisis not some bad junk like Twiligth. The cast is amazing:Logan Lerman's performance as Charlie is outstanding, i believe that hegot exactly what the character is supposed to represent, not a psycho,not a loser, just a kid with good taste, a nonconformist who wants tofit into society without changing his personality. Logan's facialexpressions are impressive, he manages to play Charlie without fallinginto an apathetic character. A+Ezra Miller, as Patrick, is even better, he plays a wonderful person,full of surprises, i think that he drowned himself in the role andthat's what makes me even more amazed by his performance. A++Emma Watson has proved with this film that she is not just a prettyface,that she is capable of more than Hermione, she was the weak link,but she did it. B+I haven't read the book, so i can't really tell if the movie is a badadaptation, but i can tell you that this is a really good film. Not onebad performance!
