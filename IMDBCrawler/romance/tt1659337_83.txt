I read this book cover to cover without putting it down (not veryimpressive, its a small book), I loved it and as a result couldn't waitto see the movie that people have said such great things about.The book covers so much more than the movie and its not even a largebook, 250 pages at most,surely enough to fit in to a two hour movie.But instead the movie misses out parts of the story that I foundimportant. The characters Patrick and Sam in the book smoke all thetime, and then slowly Charlie starts to smoke with them and then weed,not one cigarette is smoked in the movie. Then the movie decides not to include to include any of hisrelationships he has with any other character other than Sam. A fewthings that weren't mention or disappointed me:1. There is no mention of Charlie's relationship with his brother andhow he taught him to fight and how the whole family admired him forbeing such a great football player.2. His sister, he see's struck in the face by her boyfriend, no mentionof this at all. Also the following repercussions of this which resultsin her not being able to see the boyfriend, but she did it anyway.3. The rape he saw as a child, that for some reason he didn't think waswrong, which you later find out might have something to do with himbeing molested as a child.4. Charlie's teacher played by Paul Rudd calling him special and how hethinks he'd make a good writer. 5. Charlie cried in the book nearly ever 2 pages, not once in themovie.The character of Charlie just wasn't the same in the movie. Inthe book you think, why is he crying so much? What must he have beenthrough in the past? 6. Charlie's relationship with Patrick and how helet Patrick kiss him, showing how his character just does what ever hethinks will make other people happy.7. His sisters abortion. 8. Emma Watson, the British actress and her awful American accent.I could go on, truth be told, the movie was okay I was justdisappointed having read the book. My advice do one or the other.
