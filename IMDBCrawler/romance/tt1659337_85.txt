I'm a 60-year-old guy who's never been lucky enough to fall in love butI love watching other people, especially kids, fall in love. This filmwas perfect for me. It took you through every imaginable emotion thatteenagers would experience. It covers a range of themes, includingdrugs (a little) and homosexuality (a little more).There are many funny moments and it was touching throughout. All theyoung performers are superb in their roles. These are performances theywill always be proud of. I got so involved with the main characters, Iwas gripping my seat a couple of times. I don't want to give away anyof the main plot points. I'll just say that it is a heartwarming storyvery well told. If you were a teenager once or you're just a sucker fora good story about young love, don't miss this movie!
