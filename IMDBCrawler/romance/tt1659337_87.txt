This stands with the best of the classic movies about growing up - TheBreakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and Some Kind of Wonderful, while allthe while being loads more real than any of those films. This is afunny (easily a dozen times where the audience laughed out loud),profoundly moving, and inspiring piece of film.The performances are near-perfect - beautifully raw, genuine, andlacking in self-consciousness. Any doubt that Emma Watson can't beanything but Hermione goes out the window here; she's lovely, aching,alive, and spot-on. Logan Lerman has a palpable vulnerability thatmakes you root for him to become the creative being you know he can be.Ezra Miller has the sweetly manic energy, charisma and bright smilethat gives his character a live-wire presence. And kudos for touching on the importance that surroundings have onyoung lives: the city and it's features (tunnels, bridges, hillsides)become effective drivers of what these kids are going through as theyemerge into fully emotional beings.
