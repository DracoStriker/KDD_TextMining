This is Disney's live-version of its animated featured film, andretells the classic story of the kind maiden in rags, Cinderella, whois mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters, all while dreaming ofa joyful life of her own.I liked how we get to see a more in depth look at each character,particular the close relationship between Cinderella and her parents,and the events that led to the cruelty and coldness of her stepmother,Lady Tremaine. The Prince also played a larger role, as we get to seehis relationship with his ailing father and his first meeting (besidesthe ball) with Cinderella.All the characters were quite memorable, including Cinderella's animalsfriends, though they are given a much lesser role in the movie. Iparticular liked Helena Bodham Carter's portrayal of the FairyGodmother - charming and whimsical.The beautiful cinematography and visual effects made the filmenjoyable, though, I could have done without some of the characters inthe film including the Prince's right-hand man, and wished thestepsisters were given more screen time. Some of the scenes were also alittle rushed, including the scenes where Cinderella does her choresand the infamous dress-ripping scene.Overall, a nice Disney film. Magical and dramatic at the same time.Grade B
