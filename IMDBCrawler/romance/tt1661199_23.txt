I didn't expect to enjoy this film as much as I did, having not reallyliked the original cartoon version that much.But this was a pleasant surprise as Kenneth Branagh manages to not onlyretell a classic fairy-tale, but to tell a good story in general. It'sa story about family and hope, and those are all very important themesto cover.I thought Lilly James was good as Ella (Cinderella) and that HelenaBonham Carter did her normal kooky woman act well as ever. Quite whatRob Brydon is doing here I don't know, but hey.I'm not overly convinced by Disney's latest trend of making live actionversions of their cartoons, but this one was impressive.
