The original Cinderella film when Disney was fairly new had lessfeelings, humor, and talking involved. Sure, this 2015 version ofCinderella's personality has her weaker. But, she goes against herStepmother's wishes in a politely pathetic way. Richard Madden is astellar performer in the sense that he can alter his facial expression,vocal tone, and move in a way that is believable to me. Then, you haveCate Blanchett who has a stunning physique that entraps me into hergaze... almost. Lily James, on the other hand, needs to branch outtowards broader roles to show people she is capable of portrayingvarious characters in different lights to me. The father of this filmwas made by an actor that did enough as much as they could given thatthey had a very restricted time in doing so unlike the more maincharacters that were more focused. Helena Carter did a splendid job inplaying as The Fairy Godmother as she always is handy dandy when actingon set whether it is a cinematic or theatrical one to me. I felt morehumanity was put into this film because of the work that KennethBranaugh did. Also, Patrick Doyle, the music coordinator, gave mesatisfaction within this film. Patrick and Kenneth usually worktogether, so I assume that is probably why this film worked from those2 people's familiarity with each other. Otherwise, this film is topnotch overall. Some people may not think so and put negativity withinthe midst of anything Disney-related. I sense negative vibes of Disneyare growing, because some people are becoming "jaded" from seeing allthere is to see in the film business from it being 2017.
