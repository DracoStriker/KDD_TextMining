Sure it's still got some of the dated gooey-ness of the original movie,sure Shrek's impact on savaging the Disney/fairy-tale formula can stillbe felt years after release, but Cinderella is a beautifully directedand cinematographed; and Kenneth Branagh did this? Why do films like this exist in today's industry? Well franchising forone thing, and even though films like this are basically products inDisney's pipeline it CAN be well done given that the movie's got adetermined director at the helm. And oddly, Branagh, the guy whodirected films such as 1996's Hamlet, was just the guy to makeCinderella into a watchable film. It's pretty, has a good cast and hassome nice tid-bits of humor here and there. And it's an update on thewhole Disney-esque 'happily ever after' thing. Yes the story's the samebut it gives some much-needed chemistry to Cinderella's and 'ThePrince''s romantic charm. And... it works.You don't need to be a girl or a gay to like this film; just see it forwhat it is: a harmless remake of an animation from the 1950s.
