I never thought I would sympathize so much with the Evil Stepmother,but this movie managed to do it. Cate Blanchett did a terrific job, and besides you really have to feelsorry for someone dealing with raising three girls by herself, withoutbeing able to get any money except through their marriages, with twobeing utterly silly and her stepdaughter being such a nice pushoverthat she responds to everything with "Have courage and be kind", evenwhen it is out of context. I wanted to slap or shake Cinderella several times, and by the end Iwas rooting for her stepmother to win, which is not the original aim ofthe movie. Another detail that bothered me, I liked Luscious Malfoyblond hair with dark eyebrows, but here it really doesn't work.
