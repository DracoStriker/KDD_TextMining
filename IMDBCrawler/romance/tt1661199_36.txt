Seriously, People love a mouse wearing pants and a duck in sailor'ssuit.I don't mind this movie telling the fairy tale, as long as it makes itbeautiful and interesting. Sixty years ago, Walt Disney's painters,story-writers made the mice and the birds come up with a plot to unlockCinderella, get her dressed. They communicated, they ran, they trickedthe cat, they climbed the chairs, they sewed the dress. That's howfairy tales are retouched, which pleased both children and parents. I'msure we don't mind real actors doing exactly that, with the help ofcomputer graphics.I'm giving this movie 2 stars because the lizard used his tail to closethe gate. Please bring back creativity to Walt Disney. Thank you verymuch.
