With what seems like a million different versions of this classicfairytale, you would think Disney would go all out and make this onenew and exciting but still keep the core parts the same. However, whatyou get is a very outdated movie with acting that is mediocre at best.The only part I found interesting and enjoyable on film is when thefairy godmother (played by Helena Carter) shows up and does her thing.Turning the pumpkin into a carriage etc.The animated version will always be the best but I don't think evenyoung girls will be able to enjoy this. Just way too dull and it feltlike an eternity.
