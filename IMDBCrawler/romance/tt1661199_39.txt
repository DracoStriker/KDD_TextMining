It is so pathetic that Disney's Remake was extremely bad unlike thegenuine Cinderella movie. Unfortunately Disney in its easy copying of the original movie achieveda total failure.The weakness of this film if compared to the previous sequels it wouldsimply appear as a cliché.Disney pictures will rely on heavy advertising in order to attract theaudience to see it.If you are looking for creativity and an interesting movie, this filmwill not cheer you up.If you have much money and you got much free time to waste then all youhave to do is see this awful movie.
