Love this film! no it is not like the original but it is great in it'sown way! The prince is more developed as a character, the step-motheris still great, and Cinderella is great too. I think this Cinderella ismore quiet and with that a quiet beauty and strength comes through herand it really shines. I love this movie and I will always love to watchthis one and the original one.
