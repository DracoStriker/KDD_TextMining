Disney seems to be going through its catalogue of classics with theselive-action adaptations. And sadly, this is one of the better ones I'veseen so far. Not to say it's bad, but it certainly exemplifies theproblems with these adaptations.So, we all know the story. The father of our main character passes thecurtain, leaving our lovable and innocent Cinderella to suffer thetyranny of her cruel stepmother and her two spoiled daughters. Aprince, a ball, a fairy godmother, et cetera. It's a classic, but it'salso one of those stories that's so iconic as an animated Disney filmthat it's hard to imagine it any different. But that's what we need tobe able to do. This film needs to stand on its own to have any meritbeyond nostalgia fodder or something that merely looks pretty. Theycould have done away with the mice, instead of these CGI monstrosities.They could have told it from the point of view of the prince. Theycould gone the Wicked route, and told it from the point of view of thestepmother. But no, it's the story we all know and have seen and hearda million times before.Sure, it looks very good. Disney has enough talent and money for that.And, to the film's credit, I do like Richard Madden a lot as theprince. Especially because he and Cinderella actually bond in this filmthrough multiple meetings instead of laying eyes on one another andbam, wedding bells. Sure, the meetings are not that far apart time-wise here either, but at least it's an improvement.In the end I can't really blame this film for being what it is. Itcould have been better, but even as it is, you get more than youprobably expect.
