I was barely able to watch the whole movie from start to finish. Ifound myself huffing & sighing through a lot of it. I really justwanted a nice simple classic remake of Cinderella. This wascomplicated. Cinderella was ugly. Her makeup was ghastly. Her dress hadthese cheesy butterflies on it, like why? People had weird Englishaccents but then there were some black people around & an exoticprincess at the ball who wanted the princes' attention -- I mean, whatplanet & century are we in? There was way too much death everywhere.Despite her obsession about kindness & courage, she barely displayedcourage & she was most definitely not kind at the end. The writing wasa put-off, just sadly elementary. Then there was the out-of-placesecret garden -- Did I accidentally stumble into the wrong book? Whatjust happened? While she was dancing, there was way too much moaning.Honestly, I think they should have titled this "Cinderella's Secret....Garden".
