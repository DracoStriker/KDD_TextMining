Every so often there comes along a 'U' rated film one must see. These'U' films, I am quite sure, will be found to have had an inordinateeffect on developing the language of the motion picture. This is notone of them. It doesn't deserve very much more than the minimumspecified verbiage.The good thing about this film is that hideous glass slipper isphotographed so it reflects light in a really attractive way. The badthing about this film is, you, the viewer, are never allowed to settleand develop your own way of making sense of the film - essential forchildren of our generation. Whether today's children think a morestudied coolness and efficient, regularised, apportioned mechanisationis better is another thing - almost. You still have to give people fun,and this rather dull little flick leaves nothing for people to graspwho aren't addicted to expressing on the surface of the joke how funnythe author finds the actual joke. Helena Bonham-Carter does her best togive this the kiss of life some of the cast and crew's career will nodoubt have deserved despite, but she is there and gone so quickly, it'snot in the least bit worth it. Many of the lines actually hurt.The curious thing about this film is the way it does her name, but notthe slippers. The controversy of fur/glass may not look fruitful atfirst, but the challenge surely should have been how to work-inexisting details of "story variance," rather than reach straight outfor a very heavily-laid-on joke about fifteen not-very-engaged minutesinto this film. It's a shame. This version was ill-paced, and didn'tknow its coach from its pumpkin.
