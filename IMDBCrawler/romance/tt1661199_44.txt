The Story Of Cinderella or 'Cinderella Monogatari' (in Japan 'Original)was one of my favorite childhood shows. I used to love watching thisshow and i was never bored with it no matter how many time it wasrepeated. The show used to air in Arabic in the Space Toon Network. Itwas dubbed by the company related to Space Toon Venus Center forartistical production and distribution.The Venus Company totally altered this anime, but even though,Cinderella Monogatari was totally successful in it's altered versionand original after I watched some episodes later in Japanese. Thatsaid, unlike this Hollywood live-action version, at least they creditedthe original authors. Something that seems to have fallen out of voguewith the Hollywood of today.The old anime however is timeless and seriously something you can enjoywith your whole family. Avoid this carbon-copy and check it out if youare so inclined. Highly recommended.
