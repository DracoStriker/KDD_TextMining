Magical to say the least! Cinderella was truly magnificent. Like thebeloved fairytale, Cinderella (Lily James) is a servant girl to her twougly step sisters (Sophie McShera and Holiday Granger) and her crueland unspeakably vile step mother (Cate Blanchett). However, when theking (Derek Jacobi) hosts a royal ball in order to find a suitable wifefor his son (Richard Madden), who should appear but that servant girldressed in a dazzling gown and glass slippers that were given to her byher very own fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter)? From the romanceto the slightly altered plot, this movie was spectacular! Thescreenplay, although based off an old fairytale, still managed to beoriginal and entertaining. The characters were wonderfully developedand the actors were able to play off of each other so well. As forCinderella and Prince Charming, the romance could not be morebelievable. You could practically see sparks flying around the wholetheater as they meet for the first time. The costumes were gorgeous andthe music, beautiful. Everyone who worked on this film did an amazingjob. This movie provides all the feelings of young love through a heartwrenching, romantic, and inspiring story of a dirty servant girl andone true Prince Charming. I give this movie 8/10 glass slippers!
