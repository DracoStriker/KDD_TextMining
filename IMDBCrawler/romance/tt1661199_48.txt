There have been too many versions of the movie Cinderella and thismodern version was so disappointing indeed.It is made for kids only and not for adults.The movie was so boring.Walt Disney Pictures did not offer anything new in this dull andoutdated sequel.The remake was much worse than copy and paste.A lot of imitation ofCinderella movies and nothing original.Walt Disney stole all the ideas and movie plot from Orlando Corradi.See Orlando Corradi's Cinderella Movie and See The Shocking EvidenceHow Disney is clever in Rip Off & Theft.The Acting is so tasteless.See the original version and avoid this imitated version!.
