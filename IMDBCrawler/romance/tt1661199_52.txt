Disney is resorting to non-cartoon adaptations, because it is runningout of imaginative ideas. It is also releasing sequels/recycledideas/cash-grabbers instead of people that work in it say that thecreativity went down after 2005. It thrived, but /I/ thrived withMulan, Finding Nemo, The Lion King, Fantasia, Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl, Winnie the Pooh, Hercules, Pocahontas,The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Alice in Wonderland that did not haveJohnny Depp in it. Those movies held promise. But, Disney's presence isnot modernizing in the sense that it is okay for 2 women to kiss eachother. The LGBTQI community, which is not bad, is getting no promotionhere. Cinderella, in this movie, did not appear as interesting orinterested in her love life enough as it is. Making me displeased inthat does not solve this business's case. So, this is me not watchingfilms and television shows again.
