I saw this last night and have to say I was really quite disappointedafter reading about how good it was. I really could not take to LilyJames as Cinderella - far too saccharine and not really pretty enough,though far from ugly. I found the Prince bland and uninteresting andthe ugly sisters could have been so much more horrible. The onlycharacter I really liked was the wicked stepmother brought perfectly tolife by Cate Blanchett- she was gorgeous to look at, as always, andreally captured the unpleasantness of the character as written. Thetransformation scene of the vegetables and animals into coach andfootmen etc was of a quality that we have come to expect from Disneymovies so that was not disappointing. All in all it was a workmanliketelling of the story but nothing truly special.
