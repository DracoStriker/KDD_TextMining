i don't know where to start..this movie for me was so bad that it gaveme motivation to make an account here on IMDb so i can review it1)Cinderella is played very poorly by the actress who did not seemconvincing at all, making the character of Cinderella APPEAR RATHERNAIVE rather than courageous comparing to one of my most favoritetelling of the story Cinderella "ever after" played by the talenteddrew Barrymore where she represent a smart and ambitious Cinderella.2)the scenario was boring..i expected that if no changes are made inthe the telling of the story that there would be more comedy put intothat..but no changes done..no comedy added..just another boringscenario 3)so much wasted talents of the great actors surrounding themain character like Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter & RichardMadden as for the kids ,yes they'll probably enjoy it but for me irather have my future kids watching "ever after" a story of a bravestrong and smart Cinderella rather than Cinderella who's just waitingwith a smile on her face to be saved by someone
