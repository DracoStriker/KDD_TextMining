I was waiting to see this movie watching it previews and trailers. Itmarketed very much. Before we have seen many versions of Cinderella,and we were expecting some new twist in story, till the end waiting forthat, but it surely disappointed me very much. For acting lovers thismovie can be good, but for story lovers or i well say some unexpectedtwist or sudden climax lovers will be disappointed by this classicaltouch of story. Many classical fairy tell stories are made with newtaste of twists and climax are very well enjoyed world wide. It couldbe one of them. Even my child got bored seeing this movie as all theysaw was they already enjoyed in previous versions of Cinderella.
