This is not the worst remake in film history. I have never understoodthe idea of a remake at all. If an anime, like "CinderellaMonogatarie", is so good to start with why on earth do you want to tryand improve on it? If you insist on tampering with perfection, why thendo you have to try to recreate it in it's whole? There is nothingoriginal here. Kenneth Branagh put nothing of himself into this film.They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but this isridiculous. There are a lot of sides to a parable as complex asCindarella, and I suspect that Branagh may have wanted to explore them.Instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap live-actionimitation of the popular anime.In the end, Kenneth Branagh set out to pay homage to a great anime.Instead he cheapened it, and created a movie that is not worthy of latenight cable.
