Cinderella 2015 is a rubbish movie even for kids.This is not a new creative movie, but rather a dull copy ofCinderella's fairytale.Once again Disney tries to warp the minds of children into believingthat fictional creatures can create the impossible. (The scene when thelizard used his tail to close the gate was one of these scenes whichdelude kids that Lizards could perform miracles.Disney has been exposed of using hidden sexual images in their drawingsin order to corrupt and pervert kids. Search for hidden sexual imagesin Disney's animation.Honestly, I don't have anything personal against Disney,but I havefound out that they had already lost the glamour.The acting was poor in general and the cinematography was tooordinary.No innovation whatsoever in this remake.I advise you to save your money and time and to avoid this film.Disney's massive advertisement of Cinderella simply aims at deludingyou and tempting you to see a worthless movie and to make profits atthe expense of naive children who always believe the manipulatorymedia.
