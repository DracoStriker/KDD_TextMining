Cinderella is probably one of my least favourite of the animated Disneymovies and now the same can be said for this live action version.I just found it really bland, at some points boring and brought nothingnew to the table. Found it infuriating to watch Cinderella be treatedlike that; just stab them with a fork, poison their food or something!Kudos to the casting crew with casting Lily James and Hayley Atwell asmother and daughter; there were some scenes where Lily James looked alot like a younger version of Atwell.The sets and the costumes were absolutely amazing and beautiful but Idid find the carriage to be ugly and overdone.The highlight of this film would most definitely have to be HelenaBonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother; to see her playing such a goodfairytale icon but still with her quirkiness.I've seen it once and don't have any intention of watching it again.
