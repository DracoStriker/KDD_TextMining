Cate Blanchett is the mean stepmother in this new "Cinderella." Infact, she is the best thing. I thought just about everything Disneytouched turned to gold, but this was a major disappointment in alldepartments. The leads for Cinderella and particularly Prince Charmingwere perfectly dreadful with no screen presence or chemistry togetherand their characters were extremely dull. You never are brought to careabout them, despite the fact Cinderella's father and mother are gonesoon after the movie begins. I was very disappointed in this and I amsurprised to see it so popular on here. Or am I? I do see that somepeople have trashed it. I usually don't read other reviews, but, when Idon't like a movie, I look to see if others feel the same. Some saythat even their children didn't like it ? very discerning and wisepeople they will be. If you want to see Cinderella, there are severalversions to pick from, the original animated one, the Julie Andrewsfilm, the Lesley Ann Warren film, and "The Slipper and the Rose." Thereare probably more, but none can top those four ? EVER. Don't watch thisone! You've been warned. (2/10 for Cate, though.)
