I'm a big kid - 29 going on 10 - I didn't care for the animated classicDisney film of Cinderella enough to say this version isn't as good -What I will say is that this is the version that should've been inplace of the original - I loved this movie so much - The acting isdecent - but Cinderella and the wicked stepmother steal the show - Notto mention the fairy Godmother has a scene to steal, played by HelenaBoham Carter - Cate Blanchett delivers some great lines and has theopportunity to show a side of her we haven't seen before - Even thoughshe is wicked - I can't help but somewhat feel a classiness from hercharacter - Lilly James plays Cinderella - And she truly captures theinnocent love that Cinderella is supposed to have - It does pay muchhomage to the classic - but what I really like about it, is that it isa beautiful movie with a great message for the humble "Be kind and Havecourage"! Disney always sends special messages through their movies(Most of the time). I love how well the movie turned out - just abeautiful, feel-good movie - Watch it for yourself - If you're a kid atheart and love Disney movies, then you will love this.
