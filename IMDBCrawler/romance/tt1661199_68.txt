When I was a little boy, I was taught that magic does not exist and so.However, as I was going up the life has got me through a lot, but Istill could not see, feel or be touched by the so called thing:"magic"? Well one day I just decided to play this new movie calledCinderella, staring Lily James and Cate Blanchett I was neitherskeptical or optimistic about it. I just knew that a movie thatdescribes the real story is not recently made, so I thought that itwould be great to watch it. I have been watching movies all my life,and indeed this was the first time I really felt that magic reallyexists. It was because of many factor. First the story, presented insuch way, the costumes the details all designed to felt so real. Theact by all the actors and the sound. I loved it, throughout the wholemovie I was like enchanted, and when it ended I just could not help itto write a review on what I just saw. It was an amazing experience, andI am thrilled that I experienced it. Thank you creators!
