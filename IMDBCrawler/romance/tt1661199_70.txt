One day, a prince declares that hedecide his wife in a dance party. Her stepmother tries to make herdaughter to be a princess and tells Cinderella not to come to theparty. Cinderella cries out holding a torn dress which is a keepsakefrom her mother. Then Cinderella finds out someone is sitting close toher. She is a fairy godmother. She helps her go to the party and spellsher. This is a most famous Cinderella story, therefore I does not feeldifficulty understanding this story. Instead of this, I watched thisfilm focusing on music, costume and scenes. At first, its songs is sobeautiful. I like, especially, "Lavender's Blue," which is sung byCinderella. In addition to this, Cinderella's blue dress is alsobeautiful and attracting. The scene where Cinderella puts on the bluedress by spell is astonishing. I like this film so much and I expectthe later films to be also the great ones.
