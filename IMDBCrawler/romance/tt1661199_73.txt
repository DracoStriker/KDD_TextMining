Audiences gave Cinderella a grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, really? ?It sticks to the age-old idea that ugly women must be evil andcontinues to pit women against each other based on their looks."Cinderella" could have explored patriarchal confinements, of the time,that forced women to fight against each other in order to gain awealthy and/or titled husband in order to better their standard ofliving. But, nope, "Cinderella" instead chooses to stick with asuperficial conflict: the step-sisters hate Ella just because she'sbetter looking than them. Its stupid and does nothing for femaledevelopment and teaches impressionable children a completely flawed andoutdated "lesson".Cate Blanchett served the stand-out performance, but she's QueenBlanchett and rarely ever puts a foot wrong. I also thought that thecostumes in the film were really beautiful, and I loved Cinderella'swedding dress (gorgeous!?). The special effects were pretty good, butthe CGI on Helena Bonham Carter was laughably bad. ?I don't know why constant narration has become the new-trend in filmmaking. It completely defies the purpose of SHOW and not TELL -narration should be used as a framing device, not as a device to tellthe whole freaking story when the film is a visual art.The only thing I like was the transformation of Lily's carriage and herdress playing hide-and-seek with me! ?
