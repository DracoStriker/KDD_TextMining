Enjoyable retelling of the fairy tale I'm sure we're all familiar with.Doesn't really bring anything new to the table, I admit. It doesn'tsurpass the magic of the animated classic for telling the traditionalstory and it doesn't surpass Ever After for a live-action updating. Butit is well-directed, visually attractive, and enchanting in its way.There's an old-fashioned sweetness about it that I appreciate. Theromance is especially nice. Frankly I was happy that this isn't anothermovie that adapts old stories with modern sensibilities. I'm gladCinderella wasn't a Buffy clone, kicking butt and making quips alongthe way. I'm also happy to see the Prince is not a wimpy hipster typenor was he changed into a villain, as I've come to expect from therevisionist fairy tales we get today. So kudos to the filmmakers andDisney for daring to put out something that is unusual (for the timeswe live in). They proved old-fashioned storytelling is still effectiveand even profitable.
