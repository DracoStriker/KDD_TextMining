Cinderella is supposed to be a sweet telling of rags to riches, ajourney from utter sadness and loss to one of enchantment, fulfilmentand eternal love. Sadly this retelling failed to ignite the magicalspark that is so associated with Disney. Firstly her dress, what shouldhave been a gown of unimaginable beauty, glitzy and dazzling, sadly herfair godmother visited the sales and picked a frock up from Tesco. Forkids I thought the tone of the film was a little too bleak, it waspretty boring and would have done nothing to feed the imagination. LilyJames is sweet, but didn't feel right as Cinderella. Thankfully thebeautiful original will live forever.
