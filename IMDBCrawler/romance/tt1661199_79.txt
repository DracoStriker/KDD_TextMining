Greetings from Lithuania.Please don't get me wrong - i love "Game of Thrones", but this moviehas to be the most opposite version of "Game of Thrones" out there."Cinderella" (2015) is superbly made movie for a whole family (youngfemales especially). It tells well known story, and it doesn'tre-imagine it nor it's a reboot of remake of it - it is superbly maderetelling of this fairy tale. This has to be one of the most "cheezee"and beautifully made movies of all time. Set design, costumes, music is all Oscar worthy. Cienamtography isgorgeous and acting is solid for this material - there are many wellknown faces doing their good jobs. Pacing of this movie excellent, atrunning time 1 h 39 min this movie barely drags and is entertainingfrom start till finish.Overall, on one hand "Cinderella" is probably the most cliché andcheeze movie ever made but one the other hand so was this fairy taleand this 2015 live version adaptation is just retelling this tale andat the same time it does so very well - it looks beautifully, it'sinvolving and it's craftsmanship is superb.
