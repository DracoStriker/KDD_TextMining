Although this is about the stepmother, I want to first say that I foundall the characters well portrayed and supported by an excellent script,cinematography, and of course a great director. I scanned some of theuser reviews and for all those giving a very low rating it seems to methat they missed the essence of Cinderella - it is not supposed to bean action nor hard/boiled tale that apparently even some children wanttoday and should not become such.I particularly appreciated the stepmother's portrayal because itincluded clear justification for her anger and bitterness. Not to saygiven that justification she was correct to have done what she did. Buta worthy lesson for us and particularly for children.The specific scene I am referring to is when she overhears her husbandtelling his daughter how much he misses her mother, i.e., where is thelove and support she desires - a more modern understanding of thedifficulty of joining an existing family. This and other related scenesgives the stepmother a depth that makes her more real in place of theone-dimensional cartoon version - but what a joy that version was forme many years ago.
