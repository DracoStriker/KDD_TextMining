Well I went in with no expectations since I had not seen one trailerfor this film. What a boring film packed with clichés, performancesthat practically showed the actors were only in it for the money, andso many pauses or beats that made the film seem overly long for such asimple story.What astounds me about the story of Cinderella in general is how thestepmother and stepsisters even gain "power" over the titularcharacter. Just because they outnumber her and one of them is afull-grown adult? I thought the narrator in the film even said thestepmother was no longer connected to the estate once Ella's fatherpasses; it was confusing terminology but I thought that was what wassaid. In any logical situation, the estate would have gone to Ella, butI guess those rights do not hold up in an older time period.I found it really disappointing to see an actress with great acclaimlike Cate Blanchett fill the role of a terribly acted stepmother. Shejust won an Oscar a few years ago, and now she plays such a dullvillain who can only gaze, smirk, and laugh (sort of) to portray"evil."I knew it was going to be disappointing when they went with the cliché"you have more kindness in your tiny finger than anybody blah blah blahblah" towards the beginning of the film. And to top it off, a line thatbecame a motif went something along the lines of "courage and kindnessmake you strong," and it was rather annoying and cheesy.I thought the vibrant colors made the film look visually appealing,especially for kids, and the costumes and set design were spot on. Itmade sense when I saw that Kenneth Branagh is the director of the filmsince these aspects are strong in his films.Disney, please stop rebooting stories you have already animated. You'remaking them worse.
