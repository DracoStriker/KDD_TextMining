I love a good Disney film so I thought I would finally see the 2015live action Cinderella. The premise of the film sees a girl called ellaleft with her stepmother and stepsisters who abuse her. When she gets achance she tries to change her life and have a happy ending. It isactually quite a challenge to play because there are two versions ofthe character, the housemaid and the princess but Lily james did agreat job. I liked her as this average girl who tries her best to begood but decides to take her life into her own hands. Cate blanchettplays the stepmother and she was good in the movie, sometimes she is abit cartoony but overall you really don't like her character and arehoping she gets what she deserves. The prince was a pretty fleshed outcharacter and I actually ended up liking him and buying his attractionto Cinderella. Skellan skarssgard plays the kings adviser and he does agood job as a parallel with blanchetts character. The story is alrightmeaning that there are some elements that are good but it does feelreally safe. I understand that you want to be faithful towards theoriginal animated film but it does end up feeling very safe. The scriptis alright with some drama working and providing a good emotionalresponse in the viewer. However, it does feel at times that yourwatching a cartoon with the fast paced cringey dialogue being used. Thestyle is also a mixed bag, while the film for the most part looks greatthere is some use of cgi that just doesn't hold up in this day and age.Overall this is a decent film that if your a fan of Cinderella youshould see.
