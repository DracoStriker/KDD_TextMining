It's amazing to me that a story can be retold time and time again andstill capture the attention of viewers worldwide. The combination ofthe bold costumes, beautiful cinematography, and memorable cast withthe traditional story of Cinderella told with some plot twists makesthis one of the most enchanting and endearing films of the year.However, the movie also gives the opportunity for parents to have somedeeper conversations with their children. This movie seems to fit withthe growing trend in Disney to add more depth to their villains.Cinderella's stepmother (Cate Blanchet) is no doubt still evil, but sheactually evokes pity in viewers. In a scene towards the end of the filmin which Cinderella (Lily James) and her stepmother are in the attic,the stepmother explains to Cinderella that she married her firsthusband for love only to watch him die, and with him, her "light oflife." She then marries Cinderella's father for the sake of herdaughters, only to watch him die, too. Even while he was living,though, she knew that he still loved his first wife and daughter morethan he could ever love her or her daughters. Her hardships and trialshave taught her that "nothing is ever given, you must pay," and even"love is not free." Her treatment of Cinderella is by no meansjustifiable, but it is perhaps understandable. People rarely commitevil acts for no reason. Everyone has a story to be told, andCinderella teaches us that evil is not to be dismissed or tolerated,but met with compassion, kindness, and strength.
