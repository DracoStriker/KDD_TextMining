Kenneth Branagh's lavish retelling of Cinderella is one for the books,a dazzling jewel amongst live action Disney fare, boasting a wellwritten story and fleshed out characters to accompany the visual flair.The writing is considerably redone from the original animated version,with more for every person to say and do, and an overall maturity tothe work. Lily James is radiant as Cinderella, whose loving parents(Ben Chaplin and Hayley Atwell almost steal the movie before it evenreally begins with their warmhearted, comforting performances) aretaken from her at a young age. She's left with her icy stepmother andtwo stank ass ugly stepsisters, and off kicks that timeless story whichwe all know so well, given some cobweb shaking new ground to tread thistime around. The prince she meets (Richard Madden) is a full bloodedman with a lust for life and a desire to find the right woman, smittenby Cinderella every time he encounters her. Her fairy godmother (anadorably befuddled Helena Bonham Carter) makes magic and then some inthe classic carriage sequence, with pumpkin, goose and some fantasticlizard footmen all springing wildly to life. The costume design isright outta town, every dress and waistcoat a multicoloured, gildedmasterpiece of artistic inspiration, and Cinderella's classic ball gownis an enchanting magnum opus of production design. Cate Blanchett takesa previously one note antagonist and whips her up into threedimensional form, displaying aching flickers of humanity buried likedying embers in the gritty ash of the stepmothers life-sick soul.Stellan Skarsgard makes a smarmy Grand Duke, and Derek Jacobi provideswit and warmth as a most level headed King. A knockout of a Disneyadaptation and the best version of Cinderella I've seen to date.
