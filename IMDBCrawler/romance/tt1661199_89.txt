Have courage and be kind.'For those with doubts as to whether or not to watch Cinderella, tossthe jaundiced eye aside and prepare for an evening of creative meldingof a very old fairy tale as enhance by the lasted in cinematic art.Recast into a screen play by Chris Weitz who has the sensitivity tofill in the missing pieces form the original story (how Ella, a younggirl from a happy family loses her beloved mother, then lives with herfather who finally decides to marry again ? to a beautiful butself-centered mother who has just lost her husband and must struggle tosurvive with her two obnoxious daughters, taking in Ella and treatingher as a maid) makes the story come alive. Match that with the creativedirection by Kenneth Branagh and the skills of incorporated animationby Disney, anchored by a stellar cast and the whole thing worksbeautifully.Cinderella is brought to life by Lily James, her father by Ben Chaplin,her mother by Hayley Atwell, the handsome and kind Prince by RichardMadden, the king by Derek Jacobi and his court by Stellan Skarsgård andNonso Anozie, the stepmother by Cate Blanchett (strangely overlooked byawards nominations) and her daughters by Sophie McShera and HollyGrainger, and the wondrous fairy godmother by the inimitable HelenaBonham Carter ? a dream cast who are obviously have a terrific timerecreating one of our favorite fairy tales.The transformation of the pumpkin into a coach, the mice into horses,and the splendid dresses for both the fairy godmother and Cinderellaallow the magic of animation to be subtly used in a manner that seemscompletely credible ? if you can still believe in magic.In a time where the screens are crowded with apocalyptic, Marvel comicbook reincarnations, and noisy corruption and crime films, Cinderellais a little island of happiness.
