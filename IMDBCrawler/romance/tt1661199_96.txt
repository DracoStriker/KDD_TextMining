This movie is amazing! I love this. I was very moved by Cinderella'sbeautiful heart. Many times I was moved to tears. I was most surprisedscene is transforming. Some animals for example rats, lizards, aretransformed into horses and butler, and pumpkin changes into abeautiful carriage by Fairy Godmother. Cinderella changes into morebeautiful lady wearing blue dress and glass shoes. This scene isfantastic. I can't forget this beautiful scene. I think most of allpeople had known the Cinderella's story, but I recommend all people towatch this movie. Cinderella has a sincere heart. In contrast, hersisters are mean. They are villains but I think these two charactersare attractive. There are many different characters and animals in thismovie and CG technique makes them more beautiful. It is beautiful andexciting movie.
