When I first saw the movie I thought that it was such a wonderful film.I thought that this film would have exactly the same storyline as theDisney original classic Cinderella and there would be nothing special,but no it was still beautiful and the cast are all amazing as theoriginal. This film Is beautifully done with an amazing script, acting skills andwith a delightful colors that keeps the audience entertain and fun. Iactually really enjoy watching fairly tale they are fascinating andamusing and Cinderella is one of them. I've been growing up watchingthis story since I was a little girl and to see a remake of this makeme excited and curious at the same time. I'm highly recommending you to watch this beautiful film.
