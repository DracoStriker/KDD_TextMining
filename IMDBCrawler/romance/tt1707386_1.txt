This film is amazing. Absolutely incredible. I don't understand whatpeople are saying about pacing issues, I thought it flowed beautifully.The changes made worked very well. And I didn't think there was anyweak link in the cast. I honestly loved Russell as Javert. He wasn'ttraditional by any means, but what he did worked. The cgi was not the best, but it kind of created this fantastical otherworld while still being realistic and grounded. So many of the acting choices were brilliant and subtle. For exampleJackman ever so slightly altered his voice with his characters aging,which I thought was brilliant. There is no negative thing to say about this movie. However, I do seewhy a critic may not like it. It's not a critic movie. There isn't alot of impressive violence, crazy camera shots, etc. the things criticsseem to love. It's more grounded in the performances and the story,which it tells extremely well. The only thing I can point out (because I saw it with my boyfriend whoknows nothing about the story) there are two or three slightlyconfusing plots for those who aren't familiar with Les Mis. But theyare either explained later on or not important enough to dwell on. Anyways, that's my rant. Needless to say I will be seeing it many manytimes and cannot wait for the DVD so I can own it and watch it evenmore.
