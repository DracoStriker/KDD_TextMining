As a fan of the musical, I had not to be disappointed with thisadaptation and I wasn't! I had the opportunity of watching it at thepremiere in Leicester Square in London, with all the huge actors, thedirector, musical creator's, etc. It was really exciting, the actors sing better than I expected, and allthe photography added to the musical perfectly complete it for anunforgettable experience. I can't tell anything bad. Anne Hathaway is very good, as well as SachaBaron Cohen or Hugh Jackman. The musical is fantastic. The movie:terrific!
