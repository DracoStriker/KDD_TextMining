Among the worst directed big budget features in recent years, LesMiserables suffers from so many problems it's hard to choose where tobegin.I suppose the most annoying item is the hand-held camera shoved up theactors' noses. This unfortunate choice simultaneously throws everyperformance into melodramatic overdrive while also insuring theaudience a nauseatingly claustrophobic roller coaster ride inches fromthe casts' lens-distorted features.Next up would have to be the uneven performances within the musicalnumbers. This is not a critique of the actors or their singing, but ofthe director's choice to not guide them toward performances scaled forthe shots. There's a difference between belting out a musical show-tuneto the back row or coming in on a close up to capture the moment whichrequires a quieter more internal thought. And if you're going to playthose moments very wide or very close, hone the performance to suit thechoice. Too often the performance is out of sync with the shot.Next, focus. In today's world of monitors, DITs and playback, there isno excuse for so much of this film to be out of focus. I don't care ifyour depth of field is two millimeters. Go back and get it right orpump some more light on the subject and find a depth of field and lensyour AC is comfortable with.Then there are creative choices like playing Lovely Ladies strictly forthe ugliness of the nineteenth century gutter it's set in and Master ofthe House with so little energy that not even SB Cohen can elevate it.I am not sure what film all those ten star reviews on this IMDb pageare for. I can only hope that they were written by people who loved themusical and lived in hope that the film would live up to its legacy,but haven't seen it yet.As for me, I have seen it and am bitterly disappointed.
