As a massive film fan, my tastes are very wide-ranging, but I do have aproblem with musicals. Nevertheless I was happy to take the opportunityof a private viewing of "Les Misérables" at the London office ofdistributors Universal - the day after the London première and a monthbefore the UK release - because of the outstanding success of theoriginal stage show (a run of 27 years with a total audience of over 60million) and the surprising and impressive cast list (Russell Crowe,Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter,Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne). The showing was introduced by producer Eric Fellner of Working Titlewho underlined the commercial challenge of making a film in which allthe dialogue is sung and the themes are so political and praiseddirector Tom Hooper ("The King's Speech") for his insistence that everytake was sung live.The two main characters are presented in the opening seconds of asweeping introductory sequence: the police inspector Javert (Crowe) andthe prisoner 24601 Jean Valjean (Jackman) in post-revolutionary France.There follows over two and half hours with barely a spoken word whichwill not appeal to all cinema-goers, but the production is a triumphwith Cameron Mackintosh's musical opened up by dramatic shooting onPinewood's brand new Richard Attenborough stage and some historicEnglish locations. If Crowe and especially Jackman are excellent, Hathaway - who lost 25pounds and most of her hair for the role - is outstanding as thedestitute Fantine and Cohen and Carter almost steal the show as thecomical Thénardier innkeepers.I'm not sure how long it will take for "Les Misérables" to recoup itsinvestment cash- wise, but it's going to win award after award andrightly so.
