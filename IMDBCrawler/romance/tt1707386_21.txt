To be fair to this steaming pile of crap of a movie, i have not seenthe musical.Even if this movie is based on a musical it should have enoughinteresting aspects about it to stand on its own. Saying 'you justdidn't watch the musical that's why you don't like it' shouldn't beused as an excuse. The camera work was just awful. I don't want to see anymore close upsof Russell Crowe's face. The story was waaaay too slow moving and forsome reason everyone had a British accent?This is the first time in my life I walked out of the theatre on amovie. I couldn't take the awful singing anymore.Save your money and torrent this one!
