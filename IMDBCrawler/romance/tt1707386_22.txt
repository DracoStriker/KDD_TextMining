Wow. I don't think I have ever had such a different opinion on a movie.I liked alien 3 when no one else seemed to but wow. Guys I REALLYdidn't like that. Now believe me I recognize why people like this movieso much, and even though the music is absolutely fantastic and I'mgoing to buy the OST, as a movie or at least THIS movie, it's justreally bad. I feel terrible saying that since everyone loves this moviebut I just have to get this off my chest.There are many problems here but the one that the rest stem from isdirection. Tom Hooper has showed us before with the king's speech andnow again with this that he has absolutely no intention of making filmsfor the sake of film. This man wants to win Oscars and that is all. Themovie spends way to much time showing off that these actors areactually singing the songs on set, which is awesome and all but youcould be using that time to make the plot slightly more interesting orslightly less convoluted. The only time this movie reached anythingabove boring and uninteresting is when Anne Hathaway is on screen. Andshe's great and she deserved the Oscar but we all (who where aware ofthe story of les mis) knew that the role was going to win the actressbest supporting no matter who it was or how good she played it.I really wanted to like this film and I tried pretty hard butconsidering a movie this boring goes on for an unforgiving 160 minutesI just couldn't stop pleading for the movie to end. Sorry guys.
