Going into Les Miserables I was a huge fan of the long running stageshow. Going in I didn't know what to expect? From the opening shot ofthe French flag under water. The camera shoots from the water to theear popping sound of the orchestra. The convicts are pulling ships intothe shore. It truly is amazing effects and the sound is overwhelming.The story of Les Mis is about Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) prisoner24601 as he is given his yellow ticket of leave by the Inspector Javert(Russell Crowe) , he becomes a better man and becomes a Mayor. WhenFantine (Anne Hathaway) is dying and her daughter is in need of acarer, Valjean says he'll raise the child. Our movie is set aroundthese characters. Hugh Jackman- Superb as our lead with a great voiceas well.Oscar worthy performances Anne Hathaway- A certain winner forbest supporting actress, she brought me to tears. Russell Crowe- hisacting is splendid. His singing not so much but the more I hear hisvoice the more I begin to like! Eddie Raymane- he's the big surprisefor me. He ails every note as our young boy searching for love. AmandaSeyfried- though she wasn't in much her voice was mouth droppinglybeautiful. Cohen and Bonham Carter- hilarious! Nothing else to say.Samantha Barks- she has the best voice and has amazing talent forsomeone unknown to the film world. For people to know... Les Miserablesis 100% singing s you've been warned. Yes some might not like it andsome will love it! For me I loved it. It was a tear jerking, heartracing at times picture with amazing sets. Brilliant Acting also! AnneHathaway is the high point of the movie. It starts high, then goesamazing to dull and boring to comic relief to romance to gut wrenchingaction! Les Miserables it's self for me...it's one of the years best!
