I don't get it. I think people love Les Mis as a story so much theycannot write a negative review. This movie is terrible. The first sixtyminutes is almost all close up views with no background. Faces andbodies filling the screen top to bottom. No depth, little screencontext. And actors who cannot sing.The CGR at the start of the film is ridiculous. Totally unrealistic.And the idea ludicrous. Nobody pulls a ship into a dry dock in themidst of a storm when it is listing far to a side."I Dreamed a Dream" is a beautiful song and sung well, with lots ofemotion. But who needs a face that big singing it with such a big bodythat every spot on her skin is like a blob. Instead of featuring thenegatives (scraped skin, bloody cuts, ragged and dirty hair), why notpull back so we see the scene.And the music continues in the current trend of pound on theinstruments. Make is noisy. Get the deep base so lound it shake theseat. Why? Fit the music to the movie please.I think it is sad that big names, big budgets and a a beautiful storymean good reviews and awards even when the movie is second rate.
