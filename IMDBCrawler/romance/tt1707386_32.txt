This was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. Interestingly,Russell Crowe has gotten canned which is a shame, because he actuallydid a good job. Listening to Wolverine, whom I like, sing for threehours was painful. Sorry, but Hugh Jackman was terribly miscast. AnneHathaway was decent, but she cannot sing either. The ONLY really goodperformance in this movie was the child, who by the way comes from theLondon Stage production of Oliver. It showed. He could sing. He hadtalent. Otherwise this was an assembly of basically TV actors and acouple rock star types. The real tragedy of this movie is that thepeople who could have done it justice, those with musical stagecapability, never got the chance to make the kind of money HughJackman, et. al pulled down for this.The other terrible thing was the closeups. A few would have beenartistically interesting. Filming this thing so you could look at theadams apples of all the stars was strange and not very pleasant.A bad filming of a great book and a great stage play. It made my crytoo....just because it was so terrible.
