I went into this movie quite determined to love it, if not like it aswell. It's one of my favorite musicals, and the cast includes some ofmy favorite actors, so my bias is there. Well, i love it, and like itquite a bit too. It is a wonderful big-screen realization of awonderful stage production. The cast does outstanding work, and theorchestration is superb as well. This film deserves Oscar nominationsfor acting, scoring, art direction/set decoration and costume design. Ithought the editing could have been somewhat tighter. And i was put offby the new song that was included in the middle of the movie, whichslowed down the plot development unnecessarily. In fact, i wishedinstead of the new song, the more enjoyable Little People number couldhave been used in full. Stand-out song performances included AnneHathaway (I Dreamed a Dream), Russell Crowe (Stars), Hugh Jackman (WhoAm I?), Eddie Redmayne (Empty Chairs and Empty Tables) and DanielHuttlestone (Look Down). Those who are not familiar with the story maywish to check out the non-musical Les Miserables with Liam Neeson andGeoffrey Rush first, before catching this musical version.
