OK, so I just recently watched this movie and I must say I'm in love!It really irritates me that people are complaining that every word wassung.....its called opera. This wasn't a musical; this was meant to besung 100% of the time.Also I liked that not everyone was a class A singer. These are supposedto be real people with real issues (somewhat extreme but nevertheless).While it was difficult at times to understand Russell Crowe I commendhim for taking on a role that he has not been trained for. Hugh Jackmanwas outstanding which makes sense given that he has performed onBroadway in the past. Anne Hathaway destroyed me in the final scene!She was brilliant, heart-retching and devastating all at once! While Idon't know if someone who is too dense to understand what opera is willenjoy this movie; I think it's wonderfully done in all aspects. Thismovie may not be for everyone but for those who can look into the soulof this story will not be disappointed.
