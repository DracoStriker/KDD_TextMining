Amazing.... Les Misérables is a powerful story of redemption, grace andlove. I recommend the book (abridged... Hugo does go on) as well as the1998 version (Liam Neeson is a great Valjean). I could not say enoughgood things about this production. The performers were excellent, thesets and effects were great and the direction kept things moving. Ifthis were on the stage Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream' would havestopped the show... I wanted to stand a cheer. Hugh Jackman deftlyguided us through Valjeans anger, anguish, despair, love and honor. TomHoopers decision to have the actors sing on set instead of miming arecording made the experience more emotional.
