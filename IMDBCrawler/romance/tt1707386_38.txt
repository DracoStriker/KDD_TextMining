Wow! - Les Misérables is seriously Outstanding! Seriously Amazing! Ifthis doesn't win a "Best Picture Oscar" - Nothing should!! Hugh Jackman- Oscar!!! (he made me cry!) Anne Hathaway - Oscar!! (shemade me cry!)Samantha Barks - Oscar!! (she made me cry!) Eddie Redmayne - Oscar!!(he made me cry!) ...and then we move onto Russell Crowe - if only theyhad enough time to re-shoot / edit out / destroy all existence of himever being near this movie! (he Didn't make me...think he could act orsing!) The entire movie is non-stop and with them singing live whilefilming you can really feel the authenticity of their singing! Whenthey move into some of the big "torch" song - you just want to give astanding ovation!
