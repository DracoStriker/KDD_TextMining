What an innovative film!Contrary to one of the reviews which canned everything about the moviefrom the plot to the actors' singing voices to camera angles (bysomeone who, to me, is obviously not familiar with the live theaterproductions of this musical nor it appears the he has ever been toany), I find this movie version is a a state-of-the-art capture of onethe world's great musicals for the cinema screens!The live singing is superb, showing the fragility (and flaws) of everyperformer ... and that's what a live-performance is all about! Thismovie captured a live theater production on screen for all cinema goerswho never had the chance to enjoy a live theater production!Kudos to everyone involved! A must-see for all! And a must-buy forthose who wish to have a copy of this masterpiece for a keepsake!
