To be honest i only started watching this movie because it had theGladiator and Wolverine. I usually don't like musical movies much. Butright now after watching the movie the goosebumps are slowly fadingaway. What a great movie and such AMAZING acting.Actors that i didn't really know much about such as Anne Hathaway,Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks and Isabelle Allen really moved me.I was pleasantly surprised by Sacha Baron Cohen. He can do so much morethan his silly movies (which i do enjoy).But the hero of this movie is Hugh Jackman. To me after this movie hebecame one of the greatest actors. His eyes, face and voice so full ofemotion. I love him in his action movies but in Les Mis he reallyentered my heart.
