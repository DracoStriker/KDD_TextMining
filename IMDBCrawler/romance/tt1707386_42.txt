Les Misérables being my first Les Miz experience as well as my firstever musical cinema experience turned out to be amazing.The story is great and in parallel to the 19th century French era whichis one of my few areas of interest. The intricacy at which the scriptrevolves around the lead characters and some trivial plot kings ismarvelous and unlike Cloud Atlas blunder, everything gels here to bringout a perfect musical.Hugh Jackman is great, so is Russell Crowe but I didn't like Hathwaymuch, maybe because of a personal whim since I saw The PrincessDiaries. Anyways, I also think Amanda Seyfried and her reel-life loverwere sidelined and that instead of Sacha & Carter having their names inthe promotional posters, I would've wanted their names to come up. WellI am no marketing executive..Music is exceptional and choreography is good, too. The lyrics of thepieces are just so true and extraordinary that I fell in love with theverses - of all aspects.Bottom line is that even though it just tries very hard to complete thestory in about 150 minutes, Les Misérables is a perfect blend which youcan enjoy with your family! This one's got emotions like real life!BEST THING ABOUT Les Misérables: soundtrack, lyrics and music.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?
