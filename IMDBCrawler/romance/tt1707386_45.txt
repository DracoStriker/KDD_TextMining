I'm at odds with myself. Did I like this movie because it is a reallygood movie, or am I so wired into the music that I'm no longerobjective. When the 25th anniversary video came out, I couldn't wait toget it. I was not disappointed. I had seen the stage play a coupletimes and listened to the Original Cast album countless times. Theconcert was terrific. If I had to, I'd say I would prefer it to thismovie. Yet it is apples and oranges. Les Miserables has been done somany times, but in dramatic form. There are relatively new versions aswell as the 1940's version. My eighth grade teacher played a piece ofone of them called "The Bishop's Candlesticks" where Jean Valjeancommits his life to paying back the old man. We had read this chapterand it was kind of cool to talk about. This is a very nice version ofboth play and musical. It is stunningly visual, recreating the world ofthe rebels, trying to face off against insurmountable odds. The castinghere is excellent, though I wonder how these people would handle thetheatre stage. Anne Hathaway is probably one of the saddest presencesin all of movie history. She sings the saddest of songs and hands theraising of her daughter to a man she barely knows. Russell Crowe isJavert and he sings with emotion and intensity (though much lessoperatic than the role usually is). Hugh Jackman has the versatility toplay the man who must face his god and pay a price to the law. He has avery nice voice though at times it's hard to imagine him aging as hedoes. I looked forward to this film and I felt good about seeing it.There is spectacle and fear; everything is truly operatic. It workedfor me.
