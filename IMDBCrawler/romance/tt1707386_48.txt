I have never read or seen Les Mis before, but now understand it'sendurance on Broadway and as a classic piece of literature. This movieis more of an experience than a "movie" and my teen daughter and I leftwith much to discuss. Anne Hathaway's performance and singing werebreathtaking and I still get teary just thinking about it. The entirecast deserve Academy Awards in my book-every character was believable,and created a simply breathtaking performance. It is simply notpossible to gush enough. Bring your Kleenex and prepare to be blownaway. The only problem both my daughter and I noticed (which was veryminor) were the English accents displayed-french revolution shouldequal french accents, non? M'ais oui!
