Like any good fan, I have been waiting with eager anticipation for thismovie and Tom Hooper has delivered.It will be very hard to write a fair review considering I have seen theBroadway musical live as well as the DVD's of the 10th and 25thanniversary of it, but I will try.The sets/costumes...Very good, had the time period nailed perfect,watching the prisoners try to bring in a ship was kind of awe struck.To be honest the Barricade was a little weak, but they were workingwithin their means of the period. However I was confused, because theending had the Barricade that was envisioned.But let's talk about what really matters...the singing.Val Jean: I really wasn't worried with Hugh Jackman being cast, but Iwas concerned when I saw "making of" clips and he was talking about howhe can control the tempo but considering he is an accomplished Broadwayactor, he nailed it perfect.Javert: Russel Crowe also did a good job. He had the physical presenceof the role nailed however there were some spots where his voice wasoff.Fantine: Ann Hatheway did an excellent job. I really did love her takeon "I dream a dream". Instead of making it a romantic version thatusually portrayed on the stage, she made it more emotional and made youfeel the pain Fantine was experiencing.Thenardiers: Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter both did a goodjob and actually fit the roles perfect. Watching "Master of the House"was a fun scene.The rest of the cast hit their spots as well.My one issue that I had, was they wrote a new song just for the movie.They also deleted a song as well. I guess that is the purest talking inme.I should also mention..It was awesome to see Colm Wilkinson in themovie. He was the original Val Jean from Broadway and it was somethingspecial to see him on the screen.I am definitely going to see this movie again.
