I actually loved Phantom of the Opera, watched it 3 times. Thought I'dgive this one a chance. After 45 minutes I shut it off. Ann Hathawaywas just awful and Hugh Jackman wasn't any better. I never gave Crow achance to see if he was any better. BORING- BORING. Glad I didn't wastemy time and money to see it in the theater. There was way to MUCHsinging, would have been better if at least half of it were justtalking. Phantom was also singing when the time was right, but therewas half of it just speaking too. If you want to watch the story, andit really is a good story, watch the one with Liam Neison and JefferyRush, excellent movie!
