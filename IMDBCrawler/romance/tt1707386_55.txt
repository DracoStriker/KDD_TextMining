"Les Miserables" is a great musical.Don't waste anymore time. Give every Best Supporting Actress Award thisyear to Anne Hathaway. It's not light and fluffy like Mary Poppins; it deals with an extremelydark and difficult time in human history. It's a bit long and uneven attimes.If all singing is not your thing you may have trouble with this. HughJackman can act and sing. Russel Crowe gives it a good shot. So what ifCrowe sings in front of a bird statue, it's not a crow. Songs arespread out to the supporting cast and they all deliver.It's an extremely powerful movie that evokes emotion. If you don't wantto cry don't go. If you go and don't cry you have no heart. If you wantto be amazed by the power of a movie spend two and a half hours withthis outstanding cinematic achievement.
