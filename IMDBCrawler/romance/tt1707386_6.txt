As a huge fan of the musical, I have religiously followed this filmthrough its production from behind-the-scenes to trailers tosneak-peaks. And let me tell you, Les Mis did not disappoint! From thevery beginning and the first swells of the orchestra's music, I washooked. And through the whole 2.5 hour movie, I was riveted.Singing: Everybody was great! Russell Crowe was not PHENOMENAL, but wasexcellent in "Stars" and "Javert's Soliloquy". Hugh Jackman, too, hadhis weak moments...but really wowed during "Who am I?" and "Bring HimHome". Anne Hathaway gave the best vocal performance, followed closelyby Samantha Barks.Acting: A fantastic performance from the whole ensemble. Again, AnneHathaway blew everybody else out of the water. Samantha Barks, EddieRedmayne, Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were also excellent in termsof emotional delivery. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohenwere the much needed (and absolutely hilarious) comedic relief. Production: One of the best period films I've seen. The costuming,makeup, hair and set design were impeccable. I really liked how peopleweren't made to be "pretty" as Hollywood often does; thankfully, theactors' teeth were not left movie-star white.Overall, one of the best movies I've seen. I cried at least 10 timesthrough the whole film, and the finale completely RUINED me. I wassobbing a full 15 minutes after the movie ended, walking through thetheatre and out to the car.Highly recommended for everyone!
