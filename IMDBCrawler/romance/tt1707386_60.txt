If you have a modicum of intelligence, avoid Les Mis. It truly ismiserable. This movie is the worst movie I have seen in a very longtime. Russell Crowe is dreadful and can not sing a note. Not sincePierce Brosnan pierced our ears in Mama Mia has an actor been so badlycast. From the opening scene when the dote appears you know this isgoing to be a dog of a film. And that's where is remains for the entireepic.There is a reason his band is a total failure; and Hugh Jackmanand Anne Hathaway are not much better. This miserable piece of garbagedrones on for over 2.5 hours and I resented every moment. DO NOT SEEIT. EVER. If it gets any awards at the Oscars I may never watch themagain.
