I watched this movie three nights ago and I'm generally never a big fanof musicals however considering reading many positive reviews aboutthis movie, I decided to give it a try and was hoping that it couldchange my perspective. It unfortunately was very disappointing andafter almost three hours of singing, I had enough. These songs weredone by actors who clearly did not have any experience and training insinging. Even simple dialogues were in songs which were very irritatingconsidering the fact that the writer had obviously aimed for a 100%musical without any normal dialogue. It seems like a cheaply made movieconsisting mostly of only a few stages which is repeated throughout thewhole movie. The first scene was very eye-catching which seemed to havebeen designed to prevent further disappointment. Even though thetheatre had assigned the largest screen to this movie but it neverreally helped to drive my enthusiasm. The settings were always too darkand depressing. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
