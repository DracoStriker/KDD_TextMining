I confess that I got surprised in the first 15 minutes of the movie,when at no time did the actors stop singing for "normal lines", I hadnever seen a movie with that format.So I say that the feature film is surprisingly good, even if it seemsstrange at first.In at least three moments in the story I really was prone to crying(Anne Hathaway simply destroys her role, even though she appears alittle bit lightly) and this is something that does not happen oftenwhen I watch movies.The plot brings a sad story that at the same time criticizes ancienttimes of humanity, but can also be understood as a parallel with theworld today.The actors are all incredibly good in their roles, both in acting andsinging. Maybe my only problem with the film is its duration, inseveral moments I stopped to look at how much time was left to finish,not enough to be annoying, but if I had a half hour more it could bemore easily accessible.
