Ideally this would be zero out of 10, the 1 is purely to satisfy thecomment criteria.I loved Les Miserables on stage, and have a few soundtrack recordings.The 25th anniversary DVD was and is stunning.So how did they get a big screen production so wrong, especially afterthe excellent big screen version of 'Phantom'.Perhaps the magic of Les Miserables doesn't translate to the bigscreen.Or probably it was tragic miscasting for the roles. To hear most of thecast ruin classic songs, and for set pieces like 'Master of the house'to be trashed is galling. In fact hearing Borat 'sing' it like he'sauditioning for 'allo 'allo utterly ruined it for me. At least nobodyelse attempted a 'comedy' French accent.The only highlight of the film was Samantha Barks, who sang and actedperfectly.Which begs the question, why did they not cast actors and addressesfrom the stage shows ? The show is a worldwide phenomenon, and packedwith vocal talent.Hopefully this will be a warning for any future musical adaptations.DON'T rely on a big name cast, as a musical lives and dies on vocalability.If you loved the stage show then avoid this turkey. Invest in the 25thAnniversary DVD instead.
