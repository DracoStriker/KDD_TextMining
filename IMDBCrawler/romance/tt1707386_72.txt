Of films most recently seen leading up to the Oscars, this one leavesme breathless, wound up, crying, laughing and in short totally wrappedup the incredible long length of its run.I believe this film will go into the history of cinema as a phenomenaltalent & range of each actor's artistry in singing, acting, comedictiming to compel laughter, tears, anger -- basically the whole spectrumof human emotion -- and infused into the story by each.Even for those "not into musicals", be assured, you'll walk away fromthis one mesmerized and touched in every emotional string..over andover again throughout each scene.
