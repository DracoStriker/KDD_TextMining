This movie is a truly engaging, cinematic achievement, which willremain in hearts and minds for some time. The familiar lead characters:Hugh Jackman, Russel Crowe, and Anne Hathaway do a phenomenal job intheir varied roles, providing a surprising and stimulating performance.An integration of various whimsical/funny elements are introduced,while offset and led by the dramatic.While this movie IS a musical throughout, which should be known andunderstood to a prospective viewer, the singing becomes second to thestory, which is triumphant in its portrayal.For those who can can immerse themselves into the story, and not getdistracted by the musical elements, they should find themselves caughtoff guard, inspired, and lifted up by this really wonderful production.It was certainly worth the time spend in viewing it and in the moneypaid to share in this grand experience. Based on its category, and upfront understanding of Les Miserables, the whole of this movie is welldeserving of its high ratings. I give it 10/10. To me, worthy score,leaving my nit-picking of small details off to the side, as they do notdetract from the whole of it.
