one of the best musicals i've seen...Anne Heatherway is truly amazingactress & singing I dreamed a dream made me shed some tears...hersinging is beautiful & she acted the part vert well..was very impressedwith the other characters as well...very surprised at Russell Crowssinging...who would of thought this man could sing?! Helena Bowencarter was amazing/funny as well as Sacha Baron Cohan...laughed/crieddurning this musical...I would watch this again!!!!!! also made me feelfor the charters & at times had a ump in my throat as well the hairs atthe back of my neck stood up! Hugh Jackman was very good as well,Incredible songs that you could sing along to!!!!!!!!! shame theseactors are not on the stage! Would recommend this to anyone x
