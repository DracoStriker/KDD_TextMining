Saw Les Miserables last night at a special screening with a Q and Aafterward with Tom Hooper, Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried. This waseasily the most moving film experience I have had this year. While notperfect, it is a great film. Hooper's concept of having the actor'ssing their parts live on works brilliantly, and gives his actors afreedom to emote that stage performers don't often have. Most of thestars use that to the fullest. What results are some of the finestperformances of these roles I have seen. There has been criticism ofthe singing, and it is true that none of the principal actors has avoice to match some of the classic performances of this show (ColmWilkinson as the Bishop excepted). But there is a difference betweensinging a musical and performing it on screen, and Hooper has gone withactors who could perform as well as sing. If you are looking for are-staging of the Broadway show on film, then you are definitelylooking in the wrong place. But if you are looking for performancesthat can move you with raw emotion, then you should see this film, evenif you don't like musicals. Anne Hathaway may not have the voice of aPatti Lupone or Randy Graff, but she gives the finest performance of "IDreamed a Dream" that I have ever heard. Hugh Jackman is as good as ValJean. Less than perfect are Sasha Baron Cohnen and Helena Bonham Carteras the Thenardiers. Where they should have been fun, they ended up ascreepy. Also, Samantha Barks, who has the best voice of the femalecast, just doesn't quite bring the pain as Eponine. Finally, I havenever liked the character Cosette until now, a tribute to some slightchanges in the show, but mostly to Amanda Seyfried. Overall this is anamazing film.
