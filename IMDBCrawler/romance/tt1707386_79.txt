Speaking as somebody who has yet to see the stage version, this wasINCREDIBLE!When I first heard that the entire thing was in song I was a littleanxious about whether or not I would enjoy it as musicals are notreally my scene. But my god this film was incredible. It has action, romance and an incredible story that kept me grippedright up until the last minute with twist and turns and one or twothings I really didn't see coming.The songs themselves are brilliant and convey the story beautifully andthe original song 'Suddenly' sounds like it was apart of the originalsoundtrack.Hugh Jackman does a brilliant job as Valjean and even though AnneHathaway is only on screen for about 20 minutes, she really steals theshow. Russell Crowe is a bit shaky at times but most of the time heabsolutely nails it. The comedic element comes from Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena BonhemCarter. I was laughing all the way through their scenes and theirantics really break up the dark and sad areas of the movie.This film really tugs at the heartstrings and I was thinking about itfor days afterwards about the characters and their fates. As I writethis review I am listening to the soundtrack and preparing for mysecond viewing of the film.Even if you are not a musical fan, go and see this film. It deservesall the praise and awards it gets.Liam M
