I will admit, I have waited a year for the movie adaption of "LesMiserables". Let me tell you it certainly was worth the long wait. Iwent to see it with my mother today as a Christmas gift to her from me.We settled in and allowed the big screen to take us away. The story is about Jean Valjean, a convict who is freed after 20 yearsin prison and is chased by the policeman Inspector Javert. Throughoutthe chase, Valjean touches the lives of so many people especiallyCosette-whom he later adopts from her late mother Fantine. I won't go into major details. Just know that the music was incredible,the actors had all sung live. There was no pre-recording. This made itreal, and raw which the audience will immediately see. You will fall inlove with the characters and, yes, cry. But you're among friends as thewhole theater may cry so you won't be alone. The movies exceeded my expectations and if the actors, especially AnneHathaway and Hugh Jackman do not win Oscars for their performance,there is something wrong with the world. See this movie, you won't regret it. Be sure to grab a box of tissuesbefore you enter, you'll need them.
