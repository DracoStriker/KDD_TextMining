This is one of the most powerful breathtaking films I have ever seen.If you haven't seen this yet you need to... now!! I literally cried allof the way through and all the way home in the car! Anne Hathaway, HughJackman and Russell Crowe were just brilliant and Sacha Baron Cohenwith Helena Bonham carter bring a brief (but needed) bit of humour toan otherwise heartbreaking plot. Annes rendition of I dreamed a dreamhad me literally sobbing it was that powerful. I cant praise this filmenough and cant believe the people who are giving bad reviews! Pleasegive this a chance even if you don't like musicals this is a filmeveryone must see.
