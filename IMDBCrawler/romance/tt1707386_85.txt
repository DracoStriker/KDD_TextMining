Well, I watched the movie a few hours ago and I have only one thing tosay: remarkable.It touched me deeply and the performances wereastonishing.People in the movie theater started to applaud right after the moviewas over as if we were in an opera house and cheering ''Bravo''...Ithink everyone shared an overwhelming experience watching thisfilm.Even though I already knew the story(obviously),and had watched anearlier version of it,I have never imagined that it could turn out tobe one of the most amazing films ever watched in my life.If you areplanning to go see it you won't regret it and personally i believe it'sone of the best musical made for the wide screen.I didn't even noticehow quickly time passed and most important I didn't want it toend..That is all..Hope you'll enjoy it too.
