Beautiful and bold; the setting envelopes you and pulls you inimmediately, vividly recreating Paris in the 1800s in a time of troubleand poverty, but with scenes of hope and determination. Hugh Jackman is moody and loving in the most appropriate way;definitely a super performance from him. Anne Hathaway singing Idreamed a dream is spectacular and yes, believe the hype. Her acting isspot on and the emotion pours from her in a good way, even if she isnot in the film for that long. Personally I think Russell Crowe isexcellent, and I'm not a huge fan, and a great performance from HelenBonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen; very funny and huge characters.The scenes in the barricades surge with passion, emotion andauthenticity.Yes I'm a fan of musicals which helps I guess, but this is one to beseen on the big screen and definitely next on stage! Overall an emotiveand powerful film, and thoroughly enjoyable despite it being prettysombre in parts. Loved it.
