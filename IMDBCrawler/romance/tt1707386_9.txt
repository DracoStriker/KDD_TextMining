This film tells the story of a man who stole a piece of bread to feedhis sister's child. He was in jail for almost twenty years. He lives afugitive life, complicated by his pledge to help raise the daughter ofan unfortunate woman."Les Miserables" is a wonderful film. Right from the start, it capturesevery viewer's hearts. It makes three hours seem like ten minutes. Itis so touching and so poignant that everyone in the cinema cried like ababy. Throughout the film, the sound of tissue packets opening andclosing was a permanent addition to the soundtrack. For me, I just letmy t shirt be drenched in tears, as if i have had a strenuous workout.I thought the Anna Hathaway soliloquy was already with the ticketprice, but masterpiece scenes like that keep on coming. I wasdehydrated from all the water I lost from tears by the end of the film.It's amazing how the film can take us through every emotions there is.From the relentless struggle for existence, the the upliftingrevolutionary spirit, the fatherly love and the encompassing integrityof Jean. Everything keeps emotions high, and love i find my tearsliterally in a freefall mode without even knowing why. "Les miserables"is a wonderful masterpiece, and is certainly one of the best films Ihave ever watched.
