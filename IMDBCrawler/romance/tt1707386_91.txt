I watched this film with my boyfriend, who was very reluctant to saythe least about watching it. However he actually ended up enjoying it!!shocker! I loved the opening scene of the film and carried on loving itthroughout the entire film. I cried, I laughed and I cried some more.I can't recommend this film enough and I can't wait until I get thechance to go and watch it again.Anne Hathaway was incredibly moving as her portrayal of Fantine.Basically I highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you aren't a fanof musicals the storyline alone is amazing and it was a really, reallygood watch :) Happy watching guys and girls.
