This is a beautiful and extravagant film of many colors and amazement.One of the bottom lines about this movie though is that if one reallydoes appreciate musicals, theater and opera's, then you are in for areal treat as you will probably love this movie. If you're not a bigfan of the theater or opera's however, this one might be tough for youto sit through as Les Miserables is about 2 hours and 37 minutes long,and accept for the credits and a little bit of dialogue, about 2 hoursand 27 minutes of the film is all singing. It pretty much plays outlike the stage version of Les Miserables. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway own and embody their characters throughthe passion of their voices and expression of their faces into theirsoul. Eddie Redmayne and Russell Crowe are nothing to sneeze at thougheither, as they both give powerful performances as well. And SachaBaron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add the right amount of comedy tothe film. Les Miserables will be a real treat for lovers of thetheater, and perhaps for some others.
