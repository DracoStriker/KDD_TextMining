I have one question about the film. How the hell was Tom Hooperoverlooked at the Oscar nominations for best director? I've just seenthe film. He had a monumental task on his hands, and he pulled it offwith great aplomb. I think it's down to Hollywood politics, they wantSpielberg to win for Lincoln and this could have upset the apple cart.Don't get me wrong I like Spielberg, he is one of the great directorsof all time, but after seeing what Hooper did with this film, hedeserved at least a shot.There were some great touches, especially with the barricade. Having acouple of coffins at the front was a nice touch of black humour, andwhen one of the main characters died, can't remember if it was Eponineor Gavroche, part of a banner was above their heads with a single word'mort' which I believe is the french word for death.Overall the performances were all high quality and my father who saw itwith me was a bit nervous about it being ruined being a fan of it, buthe was blown away and he is a hard man to please with modern film.Go see it, and you'll probably agree about my main point.
