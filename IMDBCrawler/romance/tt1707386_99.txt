I'm a big fan of the stage production, and at the same time as beingridiculously excited for the film, I also was worried to bedisappointed as the casted seemed all for the fame. However, I wastotally blown away, I'd even go to say better than the stageproduction.Anne Hathaway was brilliant as both an actor and a singer. I found itamazing how she didn't try and stay pretty! I thought her rendition of"I Dreamed a Dream" was heart wrenching.Samantha Barks! Wow! Ever since she has been on that Nancy program Iknew she was epic! Blew me away and totally broke my heart.Eddie Redmayne was particularly good, I loved how mellow his voice was,thought he portrayed Marius well and managed to make him seem braverthan the stage show Marius Hugh Jackman was ideally suited to this partand played it magnificently showing a large vocal range. Normally, theJean Val Jean parts of the play bore me, but I was speechless towardshis performance.I expected Crowe to disappoint with his twist on what Javert usuallysounds like, but I especially liked this performance and his voicemoved me.The Thenardiers were amazing! Enough Said.The children were cast well, and really brought a tear to my eye.Amanda Seyfreid was good as well! All in all... Amazing! Enjolrassssswasss siiikkkk!
