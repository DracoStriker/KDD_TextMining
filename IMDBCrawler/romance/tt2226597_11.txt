There is too much focus on promoting IR relationships in movies andmost of the attempts result in horrible entertainment. It seems thetrend in movies and TV now is to find the rarest, most obscure type ofindividual who MIGHT possibly exist and focus all attention on theirlives as a kind of modern freak show (a la The Elephant Man). It's likeHollywood execs are saying "Lets find a story about a humpbacked,one-legged Black woman who is a mathematical genius who falls in lovewith a blind Korean pop star, who loses his arms in a tragic skee-ballaccident." The fact is that most people (in fact the vast andoverwhelming majority of people) date and marry someone of their ownrace. So to constantly have a stream of movies trying to promote IRRs(especially between a Black man and white women) is becoming lewd andis a promotion of a sexual fetish over actually making good films. Idon't need to see an IR relationship to know that relationships havetroubles and often end with disappointment. Get ready for the adultversion of this movie most likely to be called, "The Mattress BetweenUs".
