PLOT SPOILERS Alex (Kate Winslet) is a photojournalist on her way toher wedding. Ben (Idris Elba) is a neurosurgeon. That and being blackqualifies him to be an incompassionate HUD secretary. Make a reviewshort: Plane crash remote Rockies in winter. Don't eat dead pilot ordog. What could have been a decent cannibal film (Where is CrispinGlover?) is turned into a mediocre chick flick. They examine theirlives, their relationships, yadda yadda yadda, some more chick flickstuff. Mila Kunis told us how they all have the same cliché ending in"Friends with Benefits." I really tried not to barf.Guide: F-word, sex. No nudity.
