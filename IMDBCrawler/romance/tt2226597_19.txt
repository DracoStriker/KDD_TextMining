OK, this movie is preposterous. But I knew that going in and I didenjoy it. Will probably watch again when it shows up on TV. It's gotbeautiful scenery and great leads who could probably sell me water if Iwere drowning in the ocean. This movie is in the same family as anotherKate Winslet movie "Labor Day" which was an even more ridiculousromance. Plus this one has a Labrador Retriever! So if you're in themood for great scenery, a bit of tension and attractive leads, go forit. I did and I'm not sorry.
