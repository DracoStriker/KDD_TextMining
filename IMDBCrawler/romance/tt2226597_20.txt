I didn't go into this film expecting much, the reviews have trashed itand I really just went to see Idris Elba. Was I pleasantly surprised.No. Was it as bad as everyone said. No. It was decent with some flawsthat kind of just add up which takes away from the whole story.Idris Elba really holds the film, even if the whole story is a bitformulaic. Elba gets mad at Winslet, Winslet gets hurt, Elba helpsWinslet and he falls a little more for her did get a bit old and it wasobvious that by the end after Winslet got hurt a lot, it would be herturn to help Elba.Cinematically this is a very good looking film, the sound,cinematography and music all elevate the film. Kate Winslet is a little bit iffy, at times her in pain moans were abit to extreme and sounded comically sexual.The plane crash and the first 40 minutes are actually very good andentertaining, the story then goes back to that formula that I hadpreviously mentioned.This is very minor but Dermot Mulroney just looked bored.The ending needing a lot of trimming in the editing room. Too manypossible endings.Look this isn't a film that's going to change your life and to behonest I'm surprised I'm being this fair and not harsh. This is a filmabout Idris Elba and Kate Winslet getting trapped in the snow andeventually falling in love. It's enjoyable for some mindless viewing.What more do you want?
