The premise of the movie, two ordinary people managing to survive inthe Rockies in the middle of winter, seemed to be an engaging,potentially intriguing movie. Right from the start, however, the "whatthe heck" moments began to come at you faster than you could deal withthem.To begin with, you are at a large airport that is shutdown for weather,when the sky is still blue and the sun is out. Yes, a storm isapproaching, but still. I've flown out of airports in much worseweather conditions before. Nevertheless, a twin engine private plane isallowed to take off with no flight plan, explained away by Beau Bridgessince they were flying "VFR", meaning the skies were clear enough tonavigate with no help. Huh??? Luckily for him, Beau Bridges' characterdies in the crash so he's mercifully out of this hot mess at thispoint.Once they crash on the mountain, the lead characters trudge throughsnow, ice and whatever in winter gear that magically appeared in thedowned plane. They did this, apparently over a number of weeks, yetwhen they took off their coats, his hair and beard always appeared aswell groomed as the day they left, and her hair always looked like ithad been freshly washed and coiffed.At this point, I kinda just went along for the ride, just to see whosurvived. That, and the dog, who was the real star of the show!Can't recommend this movie. I don't know if the director of this hadmuch (or any) previous experience, but the attention to detail is sobad I almost found myself laughing at the incongruities.
