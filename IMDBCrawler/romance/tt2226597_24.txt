I WANTED to love this film. Idris Elba, Kate Winslet - I mean - itshould have been a shoo-in for best picture, right? I must have checkedmy watch 30 times during that movie. It was very disappointing.I don't know how they managed to make even the near death scenesboring, but they did. The person next to me fell asleep in the movie.Kate Winslet's character never really gives us anything to make us likeher - and thus I spent most of the film wondering what Idris Elba'scharacter is thinking. It is good for a long nap, but not much else.
