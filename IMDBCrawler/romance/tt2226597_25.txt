The worst damage to the movie is done by the totally unbelievableevents and things appear in the storyline. It should be the eighthwonder in the world for a person whose leg is so damaged to walkhundreds of miles in freezing snow and finally reach a humansettlement. Funnily, they find all the necessary medicine, moonboots,surgical equipment and all that in the plane or wasted snow land! Andfood never seemed to be a problem to survive weeks while they startfires in a flicker in that freezing icy land ! Ha?ha? How Kate kills asnow tiger with a flare gun like an Olympian best shot is next to theninth wonder! How childish if the director thought we were gonnabelieve all that crap? Only silver lining- the music of Ramin Djawadi that was so soothing andbeautiful. The cadence between the piano and cellos so amazinglycaptures the fluttering melancholy of lonely and isolated soulsstruggling to survive. And the cinematography is equally beautifulcatching few of the best snow landscape shots I've ever seen in amovie. Editing is smart and credible too.Unfortunately totally wasted talents from Kate and Idris, bothexcellent actors who struggle to give the best but fail miserably dueto a weak storyline and a screenplay.
