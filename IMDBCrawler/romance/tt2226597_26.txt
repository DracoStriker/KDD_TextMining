"Alive Actually" would have been a better title for this film as it isboth a survival thriller in the vein of Alive and a love story à laLove Actually. It's a thriller/chick-flick ? a strange mish-mash ofgenres that actually works.Director Hany Abu-Assad brings us the story of two strangers (Ben,played by Idris Elba and Alex, played by Kate Winslet) who, aftersurviving a plane crash in the snow- covered Colorado Rockies mustforge a connection to survive the extreme elements. When they realisehelp is not coming, they are forced to embark on a perilous journeyacross the wilderness while learning about themselves and each otheralong the way.Based on a book by Charles Martin, this film fails to bring therealities of either aspect: survival and romance, to a satisfyingconclusion. The romantic element is predictable and leaves nosurprises. The survivalist aspects bring some suspense and wince-out-loud moments, there is never a feeling of dread or that they might notmake it. What I found interesting, from a psychological aspect is howsuch an experience might draw to people together, akin to StockholmSyndrome. Because the characters are very two-dimensional, I foundmyself trying to understand their motivation and what might draw themtogether other than a basic need to support each other. Both Kate andIdris give it everything they've got but the chemistry is not there.The other thing that concerned me with the film was the sense of time.We are told that three weeks have gone by but it only feels like threedays. Plus Kate's hair is perfectly curled every morning.The only positive note in this tired trope-filled movie is that theydid not eat the dog.Wait for it to come on TV.2 out of 5
