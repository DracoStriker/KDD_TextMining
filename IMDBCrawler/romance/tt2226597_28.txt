Two strangers meet under unusual circumstances. This movie isbeautifully acted and filmed. I think the casting for this was perfectand makes the movie work really well. Some may complain about thepacing of the film, that is one of the things I enjoyed most about thefilm. It gives you a chance to settle into the movie and get to knowthe characters, without being bored. The characters are different andtheir differences are well played out and described, then you see ashift and this is what makes this a really really good movie and aremarkable love story.
