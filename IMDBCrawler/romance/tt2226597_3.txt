This movie could have been a very good movie if the director wasn'ttrying to make a social statement with the film and if the lead actorshad some actual chemistry between them.** SPOILER ALERT ** Kate Winslet and Idris Elba could not have caredless about each other and it showed....man did it show. Kate Winslet isusually a good actress, but she was really straining during the lovescenes. (Yes they DO it, Hollywood is obsessed with having white womendrool over black guys). The love scenes were so unbelievable that thedirector didn't even show the final one in the film, it went straightto credits.It is a shame that Hollywood is obsessed with the white woman, blackguy narrative, this movie could have been so good without thatnarrative being shoved down the viewers throats the whole film.Plus, the plot had the actors "concerned" about dying on the mountainnumerous times but I NEVER had a belief that they were going to die. Itwas just not believable and a waste of drama.Which brings me to "drama". There were many scenes that were supposedto be dramatic....and they too did not work.Which brings me to the end of the film. Watching these 2-actors pretendto be in love was so painful....they simply could not pull it off. Notgood.I gave the film 4-stars, because of the beautiful scenery and thewonderful Labrador Retriever. The dog was the best part of the wholemovie.
