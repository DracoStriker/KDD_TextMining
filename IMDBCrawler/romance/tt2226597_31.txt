The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because Idris Elba wasin it. It was a good movie but would have been a better one if KateWinslet was not the actress cast. I found it hard to believe that shewould have any black man get next to her after she made racist commentyears ago to Jay Leno on his late night show. She mentioned she hadmarried a man from the Bahamas. Jay Leno whispered something to her andshe said (very disgustingly) "no he's white!". As if it would beunheard of to marry a black man from the Bahamas. She couldn't pretendto enjoy any scene with him, especially the sex scene. Idris Elba andthe dog were the stars of this movie.
