10/29/17. Saw this in the theater today and it was good on the bigscreen. The cinematography was well-done and you are treated to thepristine beauty of nature in the harsh mountainous regions of who-knows-where. I suppose that doesn't matter since it could be anywhereand survival would still be the same. Winslet is in a rush to get toher wedding and Elba is in a rush to perform surgery, but the flight isdelayed and they just couldn't wait. So, they hire Bridges to pilotthem to their destination only to have the small plane crash in thehigh mountains. Winslet once again plays a woman of questionable virtueand Elba as a man still grieving the loss of his wife. In their fightfor survival (not too over the top situations, but probable scenarios)they fall in love. They eventually do get rescued, but can thatconnection they made on the mountain survive reality? The ending wasnot too schmaltzy, just enough to tug a heart string, or two.
