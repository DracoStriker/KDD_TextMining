At best this would be a passable TV movie, albeit not even on Lifetime.While I managed to stay awake I would whisper to my wife what wouldhappen next and I was always right on the mark. Surprising that the dogcould romp in subfreezing weather and deep snow but his paws neverfroze? More telling was the awful acting, especially beneath the usualquality of Kate Winslet. And without giving away the ending, againpredictable. What could have been a tense, edge of seat story abouttrying to survive a plane crash gave way to a lot of closeups and fakelove story. Thank goodness there was a Lab in the movie, best actingcame from the dog. What made the night fun was an enjoyable dinner withmy wife, snow caps and reclining, relaxing luxury lounge movie seats.Other than that I would like to have my ticket money refunded Kate:fire your agent and stay away from such fluff.
