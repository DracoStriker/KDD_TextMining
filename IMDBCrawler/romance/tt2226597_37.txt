Here's my reaction to "What the Flick" wherein Christie and Alonso andMatt gave this film Luke warm reviews dissing the dog, doubting theveracity of the cabin, and totally dissing the ending as being toohoaky?I couldn't disagree more with about half of the comments, especiallyfrom Alonso. First of all I had no trouble with all the dog shots. Icould have used more since I love dogs. I happen to like HallmarkChristmas movies and I love being witness to people finding love.Something tells me that people who are ashamed to admit such things orincapable of feeling them become movie critics. What a shame. I canthink of no exceptions except maybe Roger Ebert. The cabin being therewas totally believable. Cabins are SUPPOSED to be in the wilderness.And the ending was perfect. It's hard to take a risk. Each was preparedto do it but at different times so their pride blocked them fromcementing their willingness to be together but in walking away theirhearts won out. I loved that ending and thanked the world that I wasn'ta cold-hearted movie critic and thereby frozen from the joy of thatmoment. I only regret that they cut away from the hug too quickly. Itcould have lasted a good minute or two.?Another word about the cabin. There was no road to or from it butpeople have been building cabins long before we had vehicles. If youhad a mule you could carry up tools and find your own rocks and lumber.
