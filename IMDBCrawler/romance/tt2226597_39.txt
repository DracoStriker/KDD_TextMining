There has been a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I reallydon't understand why. In my opinion, this was one of the best moviesI've seen this year. It's for everybody. There's action, drama,adventure, romance, and more. The film was emotional, and was excitingto watch. When Ben was sliding down the mountain and nearly died, orwhen Alex leaves the plane to go for what she believes, all wasinteresting to watch. Don't listen to the bad reviews. The only thingabout the movie was the beginning was a little fast paced, but the restwas fabulous. I recommend this movie.
