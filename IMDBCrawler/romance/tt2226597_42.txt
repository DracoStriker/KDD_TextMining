I really enjoyed this movie. The cinematography was absolutely stunning& the two leads were well played. I bought into the story & left thecinema with a smile on my face. A girl could drown in Idris Elba'seyes!I don't understand the terrible reviews on IMDb. The acting was notterrible, nor was the story-line. Critics seem to expect a romanticsurvival film to be somehow cerebral. Most movies are just regurgitatedideas, so the hate here is undeserved in my opinion. Maybe these arethe same reviewers that thought La La Land deserved all those Oscars?Now there was a boring movie! Don't get me started....!Don't believe the highbrow critics here. Grab your besties & have anenjoyable night out at the movies.
