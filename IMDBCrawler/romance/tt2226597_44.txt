I really enjoyed the film and I think it had really good performancesfrom the leads in this film. It really made you feel you were theretotally immersed in their story.Films today can be really good because of the story line and scriptetc, while other films can be viewed as great because of how attractivethey are. We need to decide how we review films and there is a tendency for somecritics to be shallow in their thought process as to what makes a goodfilm. Go and see this film it is really good
