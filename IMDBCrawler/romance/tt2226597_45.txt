'THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A survival disaster flick about a surgeon and a journalist that survivetheir plane crashing, only to become stranded in the wilderness. Itstars Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, with Dermot Mulroney and BeauBridges in supporting roles. The film was directed by Hany Abu- Assad,and it was scripted by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe; it's based onthe book (of the same name) by Charles Martin. The movie has receivedmixed reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the BoxOffice so far. I found it to be mildly entertaining, and it'shighlighted by it's two lead performances. A surgeon, named Dr. Ben Bass (Elba), and a photojournalist, named AlexMartin (Winslet), meet at an airport after their plane is cancelled.They then hire Walter (Bridges), a charter plane pilot, to fly them totheir destination. After Walter (Bridges) has a medical emergencymidflight, their plane crashes. Ben and Alex then find themselvesstranded in the middle of the High Uintas Wilderness, and Alex iswounded. The two try to survive the elements, and find their way hometogether. The movie is exciting in places, but more than that it's a pretty goodcharacter study as well. It also turns into a pretty decent love storytoo actually (which the commercials definitely don't sell it on). Elbaand Winslet are both good in their roles as well, and the adventurescenes are decent enough too. I had a good time watching the movie also(mostly). It's nothing special, but it's entertaining enough.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234
