THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US (2017) ** Idris Elba, Kate Winslet, BeauBridges, Dermot Mulroney. Surprisingly dull survival story about twostrangers forced to take a shuttle air flight and wind up crashing intothe snowy environs of a mountainous no man's land with theinsurmountable odds against them. What transpires instead of acourageous and well-developed relationship scenario is instead adisappointing and pedestrian paint-by-numbers pallid retread of anunlikely duo facing a nightmare with barely a hint of chemistry betweenthe two extraordinary actors or the least amount of tension mustered nothanks to a lackluster script by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe -based on a Charles Martin novel - and the hamstrung direction by HanyAbu-Assad seems as out of his element as his characters.
