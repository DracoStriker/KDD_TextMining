I was very excited to hear about this movie and made it the date nightmovie for the week. For those calling this a slow movie, it is thatbecause this is a character piece, not an action film. This is not evenabout romance to me, but more how in a bad situation two people findout who they really are and overcome their fears. These fears are notabout the snow, FYI. The director does not spoon feed the plot to you,he expects you to be intelligent enough to get it. Both actors did anamazing job of emoting with their body language and facial expressions.I do not think the other proposed actors could have pulled off thisnuanced performance
