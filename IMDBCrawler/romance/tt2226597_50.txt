" . . . STAYS on the Glacier," is something that apparently EVERYONEknows EXCEPT for Hollywood screenwriters. When your plane smashes intoa mountaintop, forcing you to chow down on your friends to build up thestrength to walk downhill (as in ALIVE), a normal person would NOT betelling their tale to Tinseltown at the first opportunity. Similarly,when Kate Winslet endures a cozier fate with just one fellow passenger,who inexplicably fishes her out of icy waters instead of recognizingthe Karma of sitting back and waving "Buh-bye" as SHE did to LeonardoDiCaprio in TITANIC's parallel scene, why rush to blab every sordiddetail to the World? But with THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN US, Racist filmstory scribblers try to outdo ALIVE and TITANIC by coming up with a newdictum for Survival in the Cold: "Once she's tasted cougar, no moreWhite dudes for her!" Anyone who's thumbed through a Harlequin RomanceNovel in the past 20 years will recognize this sort of drift intoTitillating Perversion: The Moor the Muckier.
