Once again black male white girl... Come On Hollywood! enough isenough... instead of sending "messages" like this one, Hollywood shouldtake care of making good films. The Mountain Between Us is sopredictable, acting by Idris Elba and Kate Winslet is weak and evenpicture, in a movie filmed between mountains, is not relevant. Insummary, poor script for a very stupid film. Not recommended!
