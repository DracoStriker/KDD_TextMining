There was only six of us in the theater, and the other five didn'tcheck their cell phones during the movie, so nice to enjoy a filmwithout distractions! This is a pretty well made movie with two superbactors - Kate Winslet and Idris Elba. I've enjoyed watching Elba inaction movies, and he did quite well here in a dramatic role. It's astory of survival and romance, both a physical and emotional ordeal.The pace wasn't fast, but didn't need to be for this story. I enjoyedthis movie!
