Nothing like a fight for survival under extreme conditions to bring twovery different characters (and actors) together. Elba and Winslet werephenomenal! It is a testament to an excellent script, superb actors anda commitment for all involved to have produced this moving love story."The Mountain Between Us" was beautifully balanced between the growinglove of Ben and Alex and the suspenseful action necessary for theirharrowing circumstances. What an epic tale told against the mostbeautiful (and treacherous) backdrop imaginable! It is well worthseeing in the theaters.
