The Mountain Between Us is an adventure movie based on Charles Martin's2011 book of the same name. Idris Elba plays Ben, a neurosurgeon whohas to get home to New York to perform brain surgery and Kate Winsletis Alex, a photojournalist who waited until the last minute to get homefor her wedding in New York. When an incoming storm strands the twotravelers in Idaho Alex approaches Ben with a plan to rent a smallplane to fly them into Denver ahead of the storm. The two strangers become travel companions and when the storm comesrolling in earlier then predicted their small plane crashes high in themountains of Northwest Utah. Now, the two strangers have to rely oneach other to survive. Beau Bridges has a small role as the pilot of the plane but this isbasically a two actor movie drawing on the star power of it's leads,Elba and Winslet. When the two survivors realize that no one is coming to their rescuethey decide to climb down the mountain, battling the elements, wildanimals and the injuries they sustained in the plane crash.We learn a lot about the two characters as they travel down themountain (I can't reveal much more without spoiling the movie) and asthey survive the extreme conditions this action adventure becomes alove story.The Mountain Between Us went to extreme for it's realism. The movie wasactually shot at the 10,000 feet level in the mountains of Calgary.Theactors took a helicopter each day to the location where temperatureswere as cold as minus 38 degrees. So, when the actors seem to befreezing, they are not pretending.The movie has some amazing action in the beginning and finishes withsome melancholy and emotional scenes in the final act. It was a verysatisfying combination and I liked the way things all wrapped up.The Mountain Between Us is rated "PG-13" and has a run time of 1 hourand 43 minutes, which for me was a bit long and some parts of the filmkind of dragged on, but it is a good adventure with some serious starpower.On my "Hollywood Popcorn Scale" I rate it a LARGE.Hollywood Hernandez
