After seeing the movie my first reaction is unnecessarily toolarge...too monotonous....too less active...and a lot of too negativeaspects ....The acting is pretty good i admit....but the movie has nodestination..moreover it has been very very annoying i have tosay...while watching u need a lot of popcorns with drinks to minimizethe copious amount of drama and pace...it never really picked up themomentum..neither in the start nor in the middle...least in the end...starting with a crash the movie loses its colour as the two survivorsbegin to make their relationship....they make their bond stronger...butthe movie loses its attraction...Some small glimps of love, attractionand struggle are present...but surely not enough...some scenes arenoteworthy but most of them are not up to the mark...kate is the only positive thing present in the film....the rest isunsatisfactory....
