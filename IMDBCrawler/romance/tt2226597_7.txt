Two factors save The Mountain Between Us from romantic oblivion:Breathtaking cinematography (Mandy Walker) and two fine actors, IdrisElba as Ben and Kate Winslet as Alex. They are lost in the cold snowsomewhere in the mountains of Idaho or Colorado after a small planeaccident, but fortunately he's a neurosurgeon and she's a pluckyphotographer. Lucky about his medical skills.If Nicholas Sparks could do lost in the snow, then he could havewritten this rather trite and predictable romance. Why wouldn't theyfall in love with no one else around and such attractive people toboot? That they both are vulnerable becomes obvious; that they willfall in love is a given of the genre and maybe of survival itself whenthere's no one else around.Lest I forget, a lovable dog also is a tie to bind. To be fair,director Hany Abu-Assad and his writers J.Mills Goodloe and Chris Weitzkeep the real romance from happening through at least half the film.During that blessed time we can enjoy the spectacle and the survivaltechniques. Always with the thought of what we would do in thosecircumstances.More outrageous than the clichéd circumstance is the fact that sheneeds medical help consistently where he just needs it toward the end.Why then does the old trope of the damsel in distress come to mind? Whynot,in a film shameless with tear jerking.He just lost his wife, and she doesn't seem overly joyed about herimpending wedding and her husband, Mark (Dermot Mulroney). So you knowwhat's going to happen right to the end.I am happy to see Canada so beautifully captured on the screen. As forme, I felt captured in a melodramatic survival story from which Ineeded rescue.
