Stranded on a mountain after a plane crash, two strangers work togetherin the extreme elements of the remote, snow-covered terrain. Realising that help is not on the way, they embark on a perilousjourney across hundreds of miles of wilderness, pushing each other tosurvive and discovering their inner strength, and feelings toward oneanother......Elba and Winslet are two wonderful actors who could make the mostmundane of scripts watchable, and here, this is exactly what they do.The film throws us almost straight into the main plot arc, after abrief appearance from the lesser of the Brothers Bridges, and then forthe majority of the film, we are left with the two leads.And here where the problem lies.Their characters are about as cold as the conditions they are subjectedto, and for the majority of their journey, the conversation is almostnon-eventful, aside from the odd argument about her staying off herleg.The script doesn't allow any chemistry to flow between the two, and forthe most part, it appears that Ben really dislikes Alex, and as asurgeon, it's more or less his duty of care to look after his ailingpatient.The scenery is predictably gorgeous, and once the characters finallywarm to each other, you are more committed as to just how the dog isstaying so chipper and energetic throughout, despite being attackedearlier on.It's a shame because this film has so much potential, and despite thecharacters being less than sympathetic, the two leads make the filmaveragely watchable.The final act is the meet and greet scene, and you can see what'scoming from a mile off, and it handles it poorly.Editing is poor, and there is one scene where it looks as if Elba wasdreaming about being inside a washing machine, and it's unintentionallyhilarious for all the wrong reasons.It's not a bad film, just uneventful.
