This movie is atrocious beyond words, and the first movie from whichI've ever walked out (an hour and 17 minutes into it). The session wasfull of giggling middle-aged women, wetting themselves withanticipation - I cannot believe this book and movie has appeal. Arewomen really so bored, so desperate, that this is what gets them off??The acting was appalling - I guess that's the end of Ms Johnson & MrDornan's careers. And I wouldn't be surprised if the actors who refusedthe role of Christian Grey are secretly relieved they had the sense toreject it! The script was laughable. No chemistry between the twoleads. As for the 'eroticism'.....it was completely lacking. Stilted,awkward, poor cinematography, cheesy scripting. Just terrible. Do not waste your time or money with this.
