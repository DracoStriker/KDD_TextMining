I don't want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a briefdescription on certain elements of this so-called "film".Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward.. not to look at. Atleast convince us you're an intense guy, Mr. Grey. Plot: 1/10. that wasn't a plot for a normal movie, it was a plot forsoft-core porn.. which had as terrible acting in it as real porn. Camera work/scenery/etc. 7/10 for what it is.. great camera work iguess and good sceneryRomance; 2/10. I've seen the notebook... that's romance. This is a poorattempt to romance. It tries to tell you they're madly in love, butit's just a weird sexual relationship.Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There isno drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama. "The deeds" 10/10.. they did it. so.. can't give it any lower pointsthan this. Overall, it's was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor dramamovie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM,which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normalsex with bondage.. boring sh*t. on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that's one of thebest action movies i've seen in a while!
