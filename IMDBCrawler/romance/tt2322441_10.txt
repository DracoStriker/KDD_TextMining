Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had zero sex appeal, for me anyway. Ihoped I was going to see something a bit more provocative thanpredictable. However, what unfolded on the screen was a story withoutenough substance. So I grabbed the first hard cover volume from myaunt's large collection of "literature." She warned me not to expectmuch and she was right. I somehow got through 150 pages of poorlywritten boredom and gave up. I'm glad I saw the film for free. On thepositive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favoritefilm composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music fromthe likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps butdoes not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinionwould be different were I a repressed housewife or middle agedspinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given Iam a man.
