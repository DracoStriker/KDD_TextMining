Remember I said there was a special place in hell where they tortureHitler with Twilight and Nicolas Sparks movies? Yo dawg, we based amovie on a book based on a Twilight fan fiction so you can remember thehorror of Twilight while memorizing the new horror of 50 shades ofgray.While advertised as a BDSM erotic movie/book, 50 Shades is rather arape fantasy. I am thankful the tampon sex scene was not included; thatwould be an extra nail in the movie's coffin.But I guess the bad writing is not so visible in the movie form; andthe average sexually dissatisfied overweight housewife might stillenjoy it.
