I don't know what people were expecting. I hadn't read the books beforeseeing the movie and I am assuming that maybe this was a good thing. Ienjoyed the film. I do not agree with the lack of chemistry either.There was a weird chemistry which I believe made sense because of theunusual relationship. He is an odd character and she is intimidated andis also very innocent therefore it isn't going to be the usual sexualchemistry that you would find in a romantic film. A lot of people havesaid there was not enough sex or it was not raunchy enough. Firstly, ifthere were any more sex scenes it would have got quite boring, andinstead we got to see a bit of a story line. Also there is only so muchthat they can show in a film, surely? What were people expecting? Alsoone final point in relation to the comments I have seen regarding thefilm giving S&M a bad name; I don't agree. This is a specific storyabout one guy who is into specific things and goes about things aparticular way. It was all consensual (and it is made clear that itmust be). The whole point of the story is that Christian Grey's sexualdesires are confusing for Anatasia to understand and that therelationship is quite complicated due to their mutual feelings for eachother. I have also seen comments that this film is sexist and degradeswomen. This film does not promote that at all it merely shows a storyof someone who practises in S&M and in this instance the man is thedominant. She has a choice as to whether she wants to engage in thisand the film does not say "this is okay" and "woman should do this".The character was not forced to do anything. I do not get why peoplefeel the need to accuse films of implying or portraying such things.Obviously this film is not perfect and there are things that could havebeen better but I enjoyed this film and personally would recommend itto others. I can get quite bored in films but I was not bored at all, Ihave paid more to see films that are A LOT worse than this.
