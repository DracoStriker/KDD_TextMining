I have washed myeyes out with a mixture of battery acid and white spirits and the burnis less then watching that attempt of a movie. Now I just need to fillspace so people can see the review. You should go see Spongebob withyour other half on Valetines Day. avoid watching this movie at allcosts. I'm a little teapot short and stout here is my handle and hereis my spout.These reviews need more lines then Charlie Sheehan. I'mnearly running out of things to say, nearly but not quite.
