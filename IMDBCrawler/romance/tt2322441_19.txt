I viewed this film and my immediate thought was, "How come this moviehas no storyline?" This was a film comparable to a nickelodeon cartoonseries, or quite possibly worse. If I could rate any lower, it would bea -3 out of 10. All this movie is doing is exploiting the emotions ofwomen across the globe, and ts ripping things that started on tumblr,this just makes the cinema that much worse. I saw a movie by Disney andi vomited during the first five minutes of it, and that was better thanthis film. >Go on a date with girl >Take her to nice restaurant >Sheorders a shrimp cocktail and several drinks >Ask for the check >Thewaiter places the check in front of me, not in front of her, not in themiddle of the table >Look of horror comes across the girl's face >Ireach for the check and place my credit card inside >She begins totremble >Tears well up in her eyes >I can tell she is paralyzed by fearat the oppression she is experiencing >I chauvinistically place thecheck with the my credit card on the table in front of me, daring herto do something about it >The power of my oppression of this womansurges through my body as I lean back in my seat and stare directly ather >She is shaking with fright, the oppression strangling her voiceaway >The waiter returns to take the check away >All is lost to her now>Men at other tables begin to stand up and clap >Women all over therestaurant begin to shriek and cry >I feel my erect penis lift thetablecloth in front of me >I ask my date, "Did you enjoy your dinner?">"Y-yes... thank you", she says behind a mask of tears >I lean forward,a devious, patriarchical smile spreading across my face >And I tellher, "It was my privilege."
