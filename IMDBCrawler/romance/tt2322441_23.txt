Let me resume it. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing...The actors are really the worst pick. For a movie that lives ofsexuality they went with actors that have no idea what that means.The writing is just appalling, that is no story, is just more of thesame, a page out off that awful vampire franchise, and it even got thesame card board actors. But little girls and horny housewife's willlove it The directing, just went all over the place. The main focus waswith aesthetics, no content what so ever.There are amazing love and or sex story's out there, this in not thecase... now let's wait for part 2 and 3. I have no doubt it will selllike crazy but not because of it's film merits that is so clear to me.
