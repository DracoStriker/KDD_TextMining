Perhaps appropriately, given its subject matter, Fifty Shades of Greyfeels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen:one, a sensual and stylish romance about a young woman on a path ofself-discovery, both in and out of the bedroom ? and the other, anumbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life, bettersuited for Cinemax's late night library than the multiplex.Unfortunately, the lesser one of the pair ends up on top, no doubt dueto the creative stranglehold in which author E.L. James held directorSam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel throughout theadaptation process, meaning that viewers get to be teased andtitillated ? then totally turned off (not to mention left with a severecase of blue balls, thanks to an anti-climactic ending that calls tomind an arcade game's "Insert More Quarters" display). In other words,Fifty Shades of Grey is a victim of behind-the-scenes drama, neitherthe glossy and intriguingly tragicomic tale of dangerous sexualpolitics Taylor-Johnson tried to make, nor the thoroughly smuttyromance James clearly felt her story worked better as. Instead, tt'sthe limpest, most colorless hybrid of the two possible. Any true movielover will detest James for holding a talented director back in her ownlittle, pathetic show of dominance, though it's possible that some fansof the book may have lusted after an adaptation that, on the contrary,existed solely to allow for visualization of the author's mostsalacious sentences. That's for them to report. The fans already spokeonce, back in the summer of 2012, turning James' novel into thefastest-selling paperback of all time, which suggests more readersshare her fixation with raw sexuality than would like to admit.
