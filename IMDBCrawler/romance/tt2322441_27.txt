Besides being full of clichés, I find this film to be sexist andencouraging of prostitution. If it were just a movie about BDSM I wouldof been OK with it, if it were just a romantic move I would of been OKwith it. But promoting this poor girl - rich boy romantic story isgetting really old, really fast. As a society we are starting torealize the damaging effects stories like Cinderella and Beauty and theBeast have upon our kids ideals and their ambitions in life. This filmis nothing but worse. Cinderella goes for Prince Charming, the Beautygoes for the Beast with Money, and the female protagonist of this filmgoes for a rich man that would also like to whip her from time to time.What's next? - I don't even want to imagine.
