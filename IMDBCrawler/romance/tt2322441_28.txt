I wish I could give this a rating of 0. The movie doesn't even comeclose to following the book.Don't waste your money. There is nochemistry between the actors, the whole premise is he finds a virgin,f*s her she falls in love , he beats her she leaves. No sweet romance,didn't set up well for another (which I am grateful). If I was theauthor I would not want my name associated with this film.So manysimple small things were missed. Please if you want to see it waituntil it is a pay per view...... don't spend the money. They makeerrors all over in the setting up and they can't even make a hot sexscene. Knocked up the movie had a better sex scene than this entiremovie. Great book. Sucky movie.
