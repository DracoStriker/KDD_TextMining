Sorry but I can't get over Jamie Doran.. I mean he comes from playing aserial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to ..Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fineline between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non- existent.Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is insteadtiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven't read thebook.. and I have to say I didn't finish the movie. I don't think imissed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a manhad written the book he would probably have been jailed. Its beyondunderstanding what people see in the book/movie. Unless all the women Iknow are telling me lies and secretly want to be tied up and abused bya perverted man.
