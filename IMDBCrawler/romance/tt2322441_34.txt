This movie, and indeed the book, is NOT about BDSM. I'm 25 and havebeen involved with BDSM since I was 16, and this movie is about nothingbut abuse, non-consent, and even has a scene that is nothing but rape. Grey don't listen to his 'sub', ignores her feeling of safety, there isNO AFTERCARE whatsoever in the entire story, not even once in the book,which would make a REAL submissive have a mental breakdown after beingtreated the way this girl was. Ladies, you've got mental issues if you think this movie is about BDSM.This guy is the exact thing you want to avoid if you don't want to endup in an abusive relationship. A real dominant, a real top, would neverbehave in the manners of this so called 'man', and a real sub wouldnever accept this kind of treatment. This is abuse. This isnon-consent. This is manipulative and even have a rape scene. GoogleBDSM for ten minutes and you'll see that I'm right. That is all people - this movie is a pile of trash, the book is evenworse trash.
