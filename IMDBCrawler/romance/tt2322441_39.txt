Whoever is responsible for casting the lead roles deserves a hardspanking, in the face. Funny, if this is what E.L. James considersErotica. Dakota Johnson = zero sexy. Wonder if she was the 1st choicefor this movie, if so the casting directors for this movie need to findnew jobs asap. Babyfaced billionaire screws with ugly mouse. Horrible dialogues,non-erotic sex scenes, worst script. Good music, that's it. Billionairelooks like he was written of images of a GQ Magazine, totally patheticthat bauhaus, minimalistic stylish appeal.All in all, I have never been as bored throughout a movie in my life. Iwas hoping for some unwanted funny moments, even those do not appear,you just feel sorry for the actors for being in this piece of crap.
