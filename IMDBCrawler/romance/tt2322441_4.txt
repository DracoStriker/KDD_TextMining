I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets asuccessful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was notthe case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not beingin the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. Theysee a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blameon the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame ofmind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhatgood if not better than mediocre film.This film is about two people who have no chemistry "falling" for eachother. "Falling" like off a three story balcony leaving you without theuse of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt.This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl inover her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, ina career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is acontrol-freak who must be in control in everything he does, includingthe life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually whilethey have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he showsno love for her. If this were any other film, he would be theantagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true loveis, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a lovingfamily man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even afterthey are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderlyfemale babysitter. 50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIGFAT ZERO.
