"Fifty shades of Grey"is the most mediocre and boring film that I sawin my entire life. I was curious why it is the most expected movie ofthe year, but It was only marketing and It was a waste of time. At somepoint I even wanted to leave the cinema room. There is no chemistrybetween characters. It is full of "cliche" (the piano, the red car, thecomputer, the helicopter and more ....). There is also an totallyanti-romantic movie, I don't understand why it was launch on ValentinesDay. To bad for the director (Sam Taylor-Johnson) "Nowhere Boy" was avery good movie, so I was expecting more, but as somebody said with apoor script or poor book no director can do much...
