I think it's a major advantage in watching this film to have never readthe books. I was exposed to some of the pitiful writing briefly when Irode in the car with my wife while she had on the audio book. Thatpredisposed me to expect absolute dreck from the movie. I was greatlysurprised to find myself laughing early on--not at the movie itself,but at a particular moment in it that was intended to be funny. It wasdrawing me in, almost against my will. As it went on, I began likingthe character of Anastasia. Christian may have been a littleeye-rolling here and there, but I still bought into him. I get why somepeople are trashing this film--partly because the source material isabsolute garbage--but it's actually a pretty interesting characterstudy. I should add that my enjoyment of the film was increased becauseI watched it in a crowded theater. My wife and I were older than anyoneelse there. The reaction of the audience to the action (yes, the"action") on screen was invariably entertaining, sometimes hilarious.Keep an open mind, be a bit forgiving, and enjoy.
