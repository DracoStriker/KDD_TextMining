Many people are going to (and clearly already have based on most ofthese reviews..,) write this off as the most over-rated and dumbestmovie of 2015. It was inevitable. As someone who did not read the booksbut has some sense that it's poorly written smut, I was firstapprehensive at the announcement of this movie. I knew that it would behorrifically received by critics, by fans who did read the book andwere upset that every detail wasn't perfect, and by people who didn'tread the book and thought it was a time again for porn to be shown intheaters.But it's actually a really GREAT movie. The screenplay is stripped of(close to) all of it's nonsensical lines (there are a few, but I foundthem more fun and endearing than anything), and it next to never takesitself too seriously. Dakota Johnson is wonderful and brings a highlevel of realism and believability as Anastasia, Dornan being slightlymore ridiculous but just as good as the brooding Christian. The cinematography is wonderful, and if there are sequels, I hope thatthey are shot in similar fashion. It was a tightly wrapped little movieabout a couples weird relationship. Not to mention a KILLER soundtrack.I wouldn't write this one off until you have given it a chance. Don'tgo in thinking it's going to be horrible or you'll probably think itis. You just have to go at it with an open mind.
