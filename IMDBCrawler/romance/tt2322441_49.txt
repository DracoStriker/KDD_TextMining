Not much to say about this movie other then it was just awful. Yes , ithad some laughable humor, yes I'm OK with the sex scenes in the movieand what goes on. It's kinky fun to spice things up. Nothing wrong withthat but as far as the movie goes it was horrific to watch the acting.I can't seem to understand why 100 million people got so " 50 shades ofGrey fever". I would have to say whoever directed and cast the stars inthis movie should be unemployed tomorrow. It was that bad. Waiting forsomething interesting to happen the entire movie. A few good spankshere and there and a lot of seductive kissing doesn't make for a movie.At times it felt like the actors and actresses where rushing throughlines. it was like watching people who read three words and forgetthere lines and rush through the reading of a script. It was horrible.I would watch this with a free redbox rental code and nothing else todo for 2 hrs. That is only if you feel like killing 50 shades of braincells.
