I have read this book, so I kind of understand what the story wasabout. However, this is just an unrealistic porn video withover-romanticized plot starring a hot rich psycho and lip-biting"average" teen girl.I would say the plot is boring as hell. The main plot in the bookprobably occupy 2/5 of the entire book but 2/3 in the movie. So you mayknow that it gets really boring. Some scenes were added obviously likethe business meeting. And the lines were hilarious. the whole thing isjust plain stupid. A brainless girl hitting on some dude she met thefirst time, and that dude kept saying "I'm not the man for you, sayaway from me" I mean, really?I don't think telling that girl being his submissive is the onlyrelationship he wants or having sex with her, is something good to tellthe audience and I understand it is the faults from the books. Yet,giving this kind of impression to the young teenagers is not okay andletting them know that if you are in love with someone you would havesex with him or her the first few times you met each other isacceptable. So this movie is just a big pile of bulls***.Honestly, I won't recommend anyone to watch it, don't waste your money.
