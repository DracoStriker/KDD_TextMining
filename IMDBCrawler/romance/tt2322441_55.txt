So I'd read the book and realised it was terribly written and justcomplete rubbish. My boyfriend and I went to see the film for a laughbut it was much worse than I was expecting. The acting was horrendous.The guy who played Christian had an awful American accent. Thescripting was as bad as the book. That leaves the sex scenes... Anyonewho was expecting amazingly hot, crazy sex scenes will be sorelydisappointed. The sex lacked any excitement. It was very boring really.I've seen sex scenes in films with a 15 age rating that are far moreexciting. Basically, the whole film was a flop. I couldn't get over theamount of middle aged women giggling like young girls over Christianthough.
