I think this movie has been greatly misunderstood. I absolutely lovedthis movie! I enjoyed the book, but like many thought it was very badlywritten and the whole 'inner goddess' think kind of ruined the story.Besides that, I wasn't a fan of Anastasia, but I rarely like the maincharacter in a book. I think the movie is the best possible version ofthe book. The director did a great job - eliminating all the annoyingstuff from the book and turning it into a fantastic love story withjust the right amount of sex to spice it up. I believe there is noother movie like this out there and I'm sure I'll watch it many moretimes in the future. I agree that the acting was bad at times, but Iloved Dakota Johnson overall - she actually made me like Anastasia. Iwas very disappointed at first when I heard Charlie Hunnam was replacedby Jamie Dornan, but I was pleasantly surprised by him. He might be abit 'goofy' at times, and not dangerous enough to play Christian Grey,but I still think he added just enough 'darkness' to his character - inparticular in the final scene which I thought was incredible. Yes - youcould argue that the movie is controversial in terms of abuse, althoughit was consensual,(I disagree completely with rape - Ana was neverraped) but it's a work of fiction and if you've read the books, youknow the dynamics are going to change.Overall I loved the movie and am disappointed by all the negativereviews. Nevertheless - I will still enjoy watching it over and overagain :-)
