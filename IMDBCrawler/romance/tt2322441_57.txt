I went and saw the midnight premiere last night. I have read all 3books and love them. This movie deserves a higher rating. There are somany haters out there making this movie/book seem way worse than it is.The only disappointing thing is that there are many parts from the bookthat don't make it in to the movie but of course they can't includeeverything. Dakota Johnson is a great actress and Jamie is the perfectperson to play Grey. The Fifty Shades trilogy is a unique love story.For people who don't agree with the BDSM lifestyle I understand butperhaps you should actually read the books or stop being sojudgemental. This movie is hot and not a waste of money. If you arevery against BDSM then this probably isn't the movie for you. Thismovie actually has a lot of comedy and its much lighter than the actualbook. I personally cannot wait for the next two movies and hope theyinclude more from the books in the next ones.
