I've read the book and didn't like it, it wasn't horrible, but itdidn't have the enough quality to justify its fame,a lot of people"consumed" the movie out of pure curiosity, including me. See, you canreally "despise" the novel, but, in the end, most of you will go watchthis, either because you want to know how could a movie look like basedon the book or maybe because you are curious to see if everything youread ended up better in a film. It is pretty difficult to mentionsomething that we all haven't heard before, Surely my review looks thesame as every other in every other site. But it is important to mentionthat this movie already got several sequels and is praised by a lot ofyoung kids that watch it everyday. A lot of schools here in Mexicodisplay it for children aged between 5 and 10 years old. It is a moviefor children, so it must be judged that way. And if you look at it fromthat perspective: Shrek is a good and fun movie, teaching us about thecomplex and emotional life of an ogre... Ohhh... This is the wrongpage.
