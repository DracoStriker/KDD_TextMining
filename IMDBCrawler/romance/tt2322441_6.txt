The only reason this movie gets two stars out of me is that, thanks tothis mediocre effort, I'll be able to remind my girlfriend of what Iput up with for her the next time I get to choose on movie night and Isuggest a cheesy 80s comedy like "Weird Science" or "The Naked Gun". Idon't really need to go into all of the details here because there aremore than enough detailed descriptions of this thing to spare me theeffort of doing so and to spare you reading the same thing over moretimes than necessary. Instead, I'll just go ahead and throw my lot inwith the "haters", as the fans seem to be labelling us here.What I will add because I haven't read it yet so far, and what I thinkshould be an important point for perspective, is that every last "10out of 10" reviewer I clicked on was a newly created account with onlythis film having been reviewed. I've been around here long enough toknow that's always suspicious. I won't blatantly accuse them of beinginvolved in the film's production or of being friends of those whowere, but these new members sure are mighty keen on this rather sub-parfilm. You've been warned.
