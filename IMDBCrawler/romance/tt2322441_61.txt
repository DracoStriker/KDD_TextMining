How can anyone say this is a sexy film, is behind me. I cringed so hardduring the sex scenes and the lines. Let's not forget the lack of knowledge of BDSM during this film. God.In a HEALTHY BDSM relationship, BOTH partners must be consent and agreeto a certain activity they wish to engage (bondage rope, whipping,spanking, etc.). In this film? The girl is uncomfortable with it, butthe guy doesn't stop and say: "Oh, that's alright, we can stop and youcan tell me if you feel like you can continue this or not." No. He pressures her. Pressures. If I could, I would give this film a negative 1.
