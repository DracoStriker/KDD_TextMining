This movie basically tries to make abuse look sexy! The characters havethe emotional IQ of a three year old, especially the lead female role.I read two of the three books out of pure curiosity, but startedskipping entire pages and later chapters just to get through the book.Who has sex three or four times a day!? The books are childlike andabsolutely boring. Also, they have no storyline other than two peoplepermanently having sex, a woman with no backbone and an absolutelynarcissistic controlling man! Also, if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin, his responseshould NOT BE let me help you with that problem!!! The movie and the books are creepy. Since when has it become sexy for awoman not to be able to choose how she wants to dress, what she wantsto eat, where she wants to go....even her cellphone, exercise andwaxing habits are under his control. She is basically just apossession. The movie is rated 16 only! Not nearly enough. I sat in the movies withgiggling 16-18 year olds and thought to myself this movie should not beseen by anyone younger than 25 and in a healthy relationship withcommon sense to realize that this is not healthy or normal. I wouldfeel ashamed if I was the parent who allowed my 16 year old to watchthis movie! This is the basis that these emotionally fragile childrenwill build their relationships on one day! This movie opened a lot ofdoors that needed to stay shut! DISGUSTING!
