HORRIBLE BOOK! It is poorly written. The author didn't know WHAT shewas talking about. She should have at least researched The Lifestyle!This movie is nothing more than abuse painted to imitate romance! All the wonderful fan fiction (fan fiction is really ONE word, but thisplace won't allow me to post it spelled properly) out there and theypick THIS piece of crap to publish and make into a movie? The author has enough delusions of grandeur. Do yourself a favor - rather than waste your money on this tripe,donate it to a domestic abuse hot line (hot line is also one word, butthis site won't let me post it properly) or shelter. That's where womenlike Ana end up.
