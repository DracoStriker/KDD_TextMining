I have watched "The Last Airbender." It was bad. I have watched "Manos:The Hands of Fate." It was pretty terrible. I have watched "The StarWars Holiday Special." It was, until now, the worst thing I had everseen in my life. Congratulations, Fifty Shades, you are actually worsethan the worst thing ever. You were based on a book that was so badlywritten it's hard to believe that English is the author's firstlanguage, not to mention a book that didn't contain a lick of researchinto actual BDSM practices. And I'm not even going to talk about howthe third book in the trilogy from hell contains a scene whichsexualized an unborn child - something that made me literally throw upin my mouth when I saw it. Now, the film version of the worst book everwritten is officially the worst film ever made. We have hit rockbottom, folks.
