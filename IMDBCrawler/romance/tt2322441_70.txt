Spoiler alert!! Worst movie ever! I thought twilight was bad this wasworst I wish I would have left. That i would not have wasted my time ormoney seeing the movie. The only good thing was that she left him. Iwent with my boyfriend to see the movie. Even he wanted to leave fromthe start. I should have listened to him. Honestly all that pops up inmy head when I hear the title is what was the author thinking. Eventhough I have heard that the movie is nothing like the book. I am nolonger interested in even reading the book. I am completely unsatisfiedto say the least. It is sad that money was wasted on this film. I couldeven tell that other viewers at the theater didn't like it either.
