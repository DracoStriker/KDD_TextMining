If you like good movies, then this is not for you. If you like moviesthat are so bad they are good, then this is not for you. This movie isbad. Plain and simple. I've never read the book, nor do I have anyintention to ever in my life especially after this movie whom some haveeven said was better than the book, which means the book is horrible. Iknow fangirls will strongly disagree and praise the movie regardless ofhow terrible it is though. It's almost like people who love this moviehave never had sex and seeing such badly acted love/bondage sceneson-screen makes their ovaries burst. I have seriously seen bad pornwith better acting and plot development than this. Seriously. I'm notjust bashing this movie to go along with the masses, it truly is anunbelievably horrible movie. The leads were just bad and not even thatsexually appealing. The directing was decent, but that doesn't save themovie from its horrible script and terrible delivery. Even MartinScorsesse couldn't turn such a horrible book into a good movie. Sadly,this movie is critic proof. No matter how horrible and honest thereviews are, the fangirls and tweens will stampede to the theater andturn this into a franchise that will probably mean the final book willget a two part movie. I love sex. I love freaky sex with a freaky sexywoman. I love porn on occasion. Aside from a sexy woman, this moviecombines all of those elements in the worst way. I do give kudos toJames Dornan not for his horrible acting, but his decision to join thecast. The movie may be horrendous, but you cant deny that he willbecome a sex symbol because of it. I give it 1 star plus 1 bonus starbecause one up side is that women will appreciate men in suits a lotmore after this. Not that they don't already.
