There has been a lot of fascination of the 50 shades series amongstwomen. I have never read the books but wanted to see what all the fusswas about. After seeing the film last night I am utterly repulsed thatthis film was even allowed to be shown. We have come so far givingwomen equal rights and there is a constant fight to allow women to begiven equal opportunities however this film goes against all of this.Grey is allowed to control, manipulate whilst physically andemotionally abusing Anna. Even allowing to dictate her food and drinkconsumption. She even has to sign a contract allowing Grey to doanything he was wants to her and if she does not abide by these ruleshe is allowed to punish her by hitting her. Is this the message we wantto be sending to young girls? It gives the green light to allowingsomeone to control, manipulate and hit you. How is that pleasurable oracceptable on any level. This film glamorises domestic abuse and shouldnever have been allowed to be shown. Not only is the plot ridiculous itis also very low budget as the main bulk of the film is filmed in about3/4 rooms. The acting is equally as poor. It makes me very sad thatwomen are being 'turned on' by this film and are encouraging thisbehaviour. Maybe if Mr Grey wasn't a billionaire and wasn't so handsomethere would not be this same attraction and acceptance.
