The book seemed to appeal to women who, until they read 50sog, hadnever in their repressed lives read erotic literature but, because itended up on a best seller list, now had societally sanctionedpermission to do so. This might account for its popularity. After all,if you have no basis for comparison, you might think this is how eroticliterature is written. Sad.Sadder still is that the film is only marginally better by virtue ofits producers hiring professionals who have tried to turn a sow's earinto a silk purse. Not possible. My guess is that the same women whoneeded dispensation to read a racy book, now have the same go-ahead fora racy movie.Last, but certainly not least, the franchise touts domestic violence aslove while simultaneously misrepresenting the BDSM community. I hopefor the actors' sakes, that they make enough money to live off of forthe rest of their lives because this movie will haunt their careers.As for E.L. James, she has become the albatross around the neck offanfiction writers everywhere - decent writers who are now saddled withher godawful writing as a representative sample of fanfiction's most"successful" endeavor. Pity that.
