This can be considered one of the worst movies of the century... 50Shades of Grey is filled with bad acting and is very badly directed.Annoying and stupid, is simply an adaptation of a Fan-Fiction tocinema, from a mediocre novel by a mediocre writer. The importance ofthis movie (and the book) lives simply on the dirty minds of the 7billion people that live in this planet. Well, it is not bad enough toreceive 1... I gave 2 for trying. I thing that the Raspberry Awards AKARazzie Awards have plenty of work in this one... In terms of quality Ithink this would be the "Schindler's List" (1993) of the Razzies. It isstill better than "Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas" and "JustinBieber's Never Say Never" though.
