Sam Taylor-Johnson did a great job and the 2 protagonists acted muchbetter than I thought they would,especially Dakota Johnson (yeahgirl!!). Moreover I loved the soundtrack...no,not loved it...adoredit!!!!!!! BUT somehow I kinda got bored at the part where Anastasiagoes to see her mother.Now,from the reader's point of view I wanted to see more details aboutGrey's feelings and reasons of behavior,things that actually are in thebook(but,OK,of course you never can fit a whole book in a movie)So,to sum up, if you enjoyed the book then you'll like the movie. Ifyou haven't read the book...well,I think that either you'll love thefilm or hate it.
