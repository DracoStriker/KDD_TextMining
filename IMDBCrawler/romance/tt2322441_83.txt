I'm a girl and I hadn't read the book before I went into the movie.this was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen in my entirelife.. the writing MUST have been done by a 13 year old. the acting washorrendous, nothing about the movie was hot or well done or worthanybody's time. I seriously thought about walking out in the first 5minutes but stayed just to see if the movie would get any betterbecause I know so many people love this book. but if the book isanything like the movie, then WHY?? this was like the most high budgetporno ever except there really isn't that much to see the there wasabsolutely no chemistry between the actors. the lead male actor wasjust awkward and not good. do not see
