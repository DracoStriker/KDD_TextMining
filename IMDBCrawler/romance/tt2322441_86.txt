After reading a few reviews, I actually felt bad for loving this movie.I wanted to go and see this movie in the cinema, but all my friendstrusted the reviews and just didn't come, so I went by myself. To behonest: I ended up crying for about 2 hours after watching the moviebecause I was extremely touched by Christian Grey's traumas. I feel like a lot of people don't get the point of this story. Thismovie is absolutely not about the erotics. It is about 2 people findingeach other and falling in love, even though they both have no idea whatit's like to have a 'normal' relationship. Anastasia actually seesChristian as a person, while Christian only sees himself as a monster. I do not have an opinion about any film technical aspects, simplybecause I do not have any knowledge about that.I can highly recommend this movie. But I must say: try to get to knowthe characters instead of focusing on the sexual action.
