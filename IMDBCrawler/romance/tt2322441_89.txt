I thought it was OK. I liked the book better. I also thought thatDakota Johnson did good but that Jamie Dornan was not very convincingas Christian Grey. He did not seem to have the swagger and confidencethat the character in the book had. Some of the lines sounded tocheesy. I will still bye the movie though. I really would of loved formaybe Charlie Hunnam or Ian Somerhalder to have played Christian Greybut that did not happen. I also felt that the movie put off kind of acomedy vibe to me. I did not like that. I wanted to get chills and feellike I was part of the movie and I need more from them. I didn't getenough. I hope that they do book two but that it is more.
