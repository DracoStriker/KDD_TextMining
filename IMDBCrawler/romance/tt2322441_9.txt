Another sad movie with a generic plot with the Mary Sue / Gary Suerelationship. A relationship so horrid that it reaches a limit whenrape is involved. This book turned movie is a mere reminder that'Hollywood' will create anything without investigating the ratherobvious 'unusual behavior' -- which, lets be honest here, isn't unusualuntil you put a married man and a girl who cannot bite her lip for thelife of her in the same room. It is more than evident there is nochemistry on set, and off set. Jamie, you could have done so muchbetter. Dakota, no, just no. Thank you, EL for your horrible outlook onBDSM and your plagiarized mistake of a 'book'. You truly have givenwriters everywhere a reason to wish they'd never written, and a reasonas to why actors never wish to take part in anything that relates tothis horrible mess of a movie.
