I have read the books and today saw the movie. I liked it very much.Many reviews have indicated the book/movie is degrading to women. Notso. There are hundreds of movies degrading to women. Just go watch theWolf of Wall Street if you want to see degrading behavior. This is aromance story with some unusual sexual behavior, but hey they areconsenting adults. Christian NEVER does anything Ana does not give himpermission or even ask him to do...NEVER. There were a few plot pointsI would have liked to see in the movie, but overall they did a goodjob. The sex was tastefully done and not over the top by any means. Thetwo lovers are like rabbits in the books. I was happy to see it pulledback to something more reasonable. Over 100 million books and soon tobe over 100 million at the box office. People pay for a good story, soby these measures (and mine) this is a good story.
