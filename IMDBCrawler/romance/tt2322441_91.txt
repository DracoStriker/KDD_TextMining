I have read all 3 of the fifty shades of grey books and was excited towatch the film, however when i started reading the negative reviews istarted to have my doubts as whether i should bother. Luckily i decidedto go with my boyfriend and i was pleasantly surprised.I thought overall the storyline was much like that of the book, yes thesex scenes weren't as raunchy as some in the book but i think puttingthe scenes in the film would have basically made the film look cheapand tacky.Everyone who is complaining about the film not being raunchy enoughthen to be honest just watch porn, the movie isn't just about sex itsabout how two people begin to slowly grow feelings for each other andthe challenges they face such as christians inability to show love andhow he seems to always guard his feelings due to his tortured past.The acting of jamie and dakota was good, yes it isn't Oscar worthy butit made the characters believable and you started to care about themand as the film went on you could see the chemistry growing betweenthem.In my review i didn't want to give too much away, but don't just readthe bad reviews and not see the film give the film a chance. Even myboyfriend (who i had to practically drag to the film) admitted that thefilm was good, so please give it a chance and i cant wait for thesequel
