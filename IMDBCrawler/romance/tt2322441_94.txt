I am going to keep this short and sweet. A lot of the negative reviewsare coming from someone that has either not read the books or did notlike the books! If you liked the books you will like the movie! Thelines are word for word from the novel, cheesy lines and all! Theactors did a great job portraying Christian and Anastasia... The waythey interact with one another is straight off the pages of the novel!If you did not like the books then do not see the movie because youwill be disappointed. The sex scenes in the movie are graphic but theycannot be compared with porn. It was a little awkward watching thisfilm in a theater full of strangers but after you get past the firstfew naughty scenes it is smooth sailing! Can't wait for the next one!
