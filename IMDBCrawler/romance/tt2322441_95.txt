College student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) interviews youngmillionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). He becomes obsessed with herand she starts falling for him. However he has control issues and isinto BDSM. Can she deal with that? Ignore all the controversy about this. In many ways this is justanother romantic drama about a couple dealing with issues--those issuesjust happen to be BDSM and control. It has all the romantic meetings,the nonstop love songs on the soundtrack and some fairly explicit (buttasteful) sex. The BDSM is confined to just two scenes and it's notthat bad. There is nudity but almost all of it is from Johnson. Dornanjust bares his butt three times and that's it. It seems kind of strangethat a movie targeted at women has so little male nudity. It's alsowell-directed and is more or less interesting. However it goes on fortoo long and keeps repeating itself. Also the character of Mr. Greycomes across as more than a little creepy. The acting varies. Johnsonis very good in her role. Dornan is ridiculously handsome and allpumped up but lacks the charisma that his character should have. All inall a pretty good romantic drama.
