Having read the books numerous amounts of time and a massive fan,watching the movie I was very disappointed.I felt as each scene was rushed and the film jumped too quickly to thenext scenario, not explaining what was actually going on. If I hadn'tof read the book already I wouldn't of known what the hell washappening! I'm also disappointed at the fact they missed out a few key pointswhich play a big part in the next books, such as Ana's new job and JackHyde.. To me it felt like the directors of this movie had a quick scan of thebook and made a movie completely different. I just hope the next onesare better as this one is awful!
