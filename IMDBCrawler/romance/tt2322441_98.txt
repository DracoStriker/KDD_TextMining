I was a little hesitant when I decided to go watch the movie, since inmy opinion most movies made from books lack a lot of scenes that areoriginally in the book. Jamie and Dakota have a palpable connection,despite other negative reviews (another reason why I was doubting thismovie), cinematography was great, and over all this movie was if notcompletely then very close to what I was expecting after reading thebooks. Right after leaving the movie theater I wanted to go back andwatch it again, it leaves you wanting to know more about ChristianGrey, even when you've already read the books. I'm looking forward tothe next one and I recommend you watch this one and don't listen to allthe negative reviews. I loved it!
