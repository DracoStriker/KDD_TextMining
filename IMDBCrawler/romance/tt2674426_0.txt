How can so many people get this this movie wrong, especially thecritics? The high point of the film is the performance by EmeliaClarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable andwonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second tonone.Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who isparalyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romancedevelops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profounddisability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The moviedepicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's ownjudgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would preferto die.With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain andsuffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the goodtimes and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated,the character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love.
