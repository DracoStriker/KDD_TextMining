I was expecting the usual American love story, but that's not what thisis. I have neither seen nor heard of these actors prior to seeing thisfilm. That said, I usually don't go to see films like this.What a wonderful movie! The acting was so well done. My heart brokewhere it needed to break, and it laughed where it needed to laugh. For those who need help working on their empathy, or the opening of themind, this is a very good movie to see!It's very thought provoking and I would even suggest to professors(philosophy,english,cultural perspectives in science, sociology) thatthey have their students write a paper on this. There are so manyissues involved here. Great for discussion!
