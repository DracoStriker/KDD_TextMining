I liked this movie. I like the dialogue its quite charming and thecomedy bits work really well .I was pleasantly surprised that therewere not cliché moments and the flow of the story came naturally . The2 main characters have great chemistry and Emilia Clark is simplyadorable .Its a simple story told well.The director of the film did a good job overall however there was 1problem with this movie and that was the soundtrack they used . Exceptthe 2 bits of classic music the rest of it was simply abysmal and itreally hurt the movie . It gave that cheesy soapy feel of a telenovelaepisode.But getting past that i really enjoyed this movie more then i thought iwould and i would recommend watching this . Have fun!
