The movie really was adorable! I knew exactly what to expect since Iread the book, but I loved the adaptation. What helps the movie most is that the novelist, Jojo Moyees, wrote herown screenplay. She did a great job transitioning the story from paperto screen. Little things that were left out of the novel weren't reallyneeded to move the story along. Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafin were excellent. Her facialexpressions were amazing and her insane eyebrows deserve some type ofaward all on their own. I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well.Don't listen to critics and go see this movie.
