One of the best Romantic movies lately.. I am very taken with EmiliaClark's performance and smile. She was amazing and breathtaking. Themusic is well chosen and the acting is good and there were some verytouching moments that will make the audience who didn't watch yet cry.Lou is a funny young woman who wants to live a simple life, who wantsto wear clothes and be fashionable in her own way. The paralyzed man isa damaged cause looking for hope. Both these characters are verydifferent, yes they pick things from each other and they put smiles oneach others faces. A couple that wouldn't get bored giving and takingto their souls.. Maybe, when it comes to believing in loveunconditionally, Faith is hope then. Live the life as it faces youthen. In health and sickness. In the sweetest moments and bitterestones. Just live your life No matter what happens to you. Always getback and fight to survive and be alive. That is what this movie is allabout...
