the art of Movies should give people hope, instead; this movie is ahope killer. this movie is saying "live Boldly", unless you are arewith disability !! what about real people with real disability who willwatch this movie? the movie makers are telling them that it's better todie than to struggle in life !!We have many incredible examples for people with disability like (forexample) stephen hawking, whose disability was even greater than"will", hawking couldn't even speak or move his head. but he he is oneof the greatest scientists in the world. Many moments in the movie are cheerful & touching, specially Lou who ishilarious funny & very innocent; however, the message the moviedelivering is terrible.
