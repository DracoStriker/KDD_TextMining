Repeat, spoiler alert. Though, if you're wise, you won't waste yourtime on this movie.A summary would be, enter William, a rich, spoiled playboy who haseverything he wants and does anything he wants with whomever he wants.Then he has a tragic accident, leaving him paralyzed. He decides thatthis kind of life isn't worth living, and wants to be killed. Hepromises his parents 6 months, where enters Lou, the charming,high-spirited woman who in an effort to show him life IS worth living(in which is still an entirely self-centered focused only on makinghimself happy), she falls in love with him. All seems to be going well,they think he has abandoned thoughts of suicide... but no. He selfishlydecides to throw his life away, because he can't have everything hisway. And it is wrapped in a cloak of care, and love, and support topeople's decisions... but ultimately, it is sending the message, "Itdoesn't matter who loves you, or how important you can be, or what youcan do for others... if YOU don't have EVERYTHING you want and have itYOUR way, just give up." In a day when depression and suicides are atan all-time high, here comes a story that had the potential to be agreat encouragement to anyone dealing with depression and suicidalthoughts, but instead encourages people to give up and throw it allaway.Especially when you think of the high percentage of suicides orattempts by teenage girls, and an actor like Sam who is idolized bymany, presenting this message, it is appalling that such messages arebeing presented as "entertainment".
