Me Before You is an outstanding adaptation of Jojo Moyes' novel aboutLouisa taking care of the moody and pretentious Will Traynor. The bookitself is very detailed and gives you all the specifics about theirrelationship and this is also seen throughout the movie. I had waited along time after reading the book to find out that the movie is comingout featuring Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke. What more could be betterthan Finnick from the Hunger Games and Daenerys from Game of Thrones?Their chemistry for one another is astounding. Even though some may seethis as a cliché movie where Louisa finds Will love and expresses itthroughout the movie whilst adding a lot of humour, it's the ending ofthis movie which changes a lot of views and perspectives. For meespecially, I found it very emotional as did many who watched itbecause you expect there to be a happy ending. Even though the endingwas still very good, I feel as if the movie is very rushed and you'dexpect there to be more. I feel like a whole lot from the book couldhave been added to give the audience more awareness as some things wereconfusing and you'd have to read the book to understand. Nevertheless,the movie was amazing and heartbreaking to say the least and I do thinkit is a special thing for everyone to watch.
