I went for an unplanned movie in the cinema's yesterday and chose MeBefore You because the trailer looked good and I wanted to see EmiliaClarke star a whole different role at least once. Since everyone,including me, knows her from the Game of Thrones series on TV, playinga real war-chick, it's hard to imagine her playing something sodelicate. In the first 30 minutes of the movie, I already saw this wasgoing to be great. Emilia can show so many emotions in her face withouteven trying, which makes it clear why they chose her. The way she livedLou in the movie was just amazing, real and definitely sincere.This is a must-see movie, not only today, but tomorrow, next year andin 10 years as well.Rating : 10/10 for sure!
