really good movie first one to made me cry great performances fromeveryone. Emilia and Sam have a good chemistry. People are saying thathe should not have done it, but i think it was is choice, and everyoneshould respect it, but however he should have give it a harder try. Inconclusion is a great great movie, well casted and beautifulenvironments too. I cant possibly imagine what people whom are disabledgo trough. Sam gives a solid performance as a disabled person, in thebegging is a smart-ass but then he becomes really cool, which meansthat Sam is a good actor, and Emilia is great with that goofy look onher face and always chating and smiling,
