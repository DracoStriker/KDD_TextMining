i have watched very little of the movies which were based on anyROMANTIC BOOKS like "The Fault in Our Stars", but this movie is andwill be one of the Greatest and one of the Best Romantic Movie I wouldhave ever watched.I have watched Emilia Clarke, playing the role of Lou Clark, in somegreat movies and of course Game of Thrones, it was good to see changein the type of Role she played in this Movie. I and many audience hasmade an image of Emilia Clarke as a strong and Bold Character playingactress( well according to me only) as she had the recent movie ofTerminator: Genisys, and the famous Khaleesi/ Mother of Dragons.Sam Claffin on the other hand did a tremendous job, he did his Homeworkvery well, according to me he painted the perfect portrait of WillTraynor as a person who was full of life and how his life suddenlychanges because of the Accident. He also acted well as we can certainlysee how a person gets Cranky when something he had lost in his lifewhich he cherished and loved.
