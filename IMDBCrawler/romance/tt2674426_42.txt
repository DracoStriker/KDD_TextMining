I never thought I'd watch a movie and laugh and cry at the same time. Idon't know how the actors were selected but I must say the combinationis a miracle. I wish I knew Emilia Clarke (Lou) personality to figureout the gap between the real her and the character she played in thismovie. After watching this movie, I became so emotional. I felt loveand loved. I watched it alone and wish I did with my girlfriend.Although the ending got me nervous, it was cool. I couldn't think ofsomething better. Big thumbs up for the whole Me Before You crew. Youguys did it. I wasn't a big fan of love stories but now, that's whereI'm heading.
