So at first I thought it was going to be another pretty predictablemovie and I was only watching it because I love Emilia Clarke. But Iwas actually pleasantly surprised. The movie was not predictable at alland really was special for a lot of reasons. Also the acting performances were very good. Emilia Clarke did a greatjob at playing an adorable, clumsy, sweet girl and Sam Claflin too dida great performance as a disabled young man. The movie did really hit me right in the feels cause it could reallytake you away and the actors had a great chemistry on screen. The musicwas good but not the best soundtrack I've heard and would personallyhave made a completely original soundtrack for a movie like this.
