I thought it was beautifully produced and it was an excellent film.I cannot help, but think that we all of us see things differently. Thisis obvious when I read some of the reviews.I am really glad I watched the film and I found it uplifting andinspiring.Emilia Clarke reminded me a little bit of a Bridget Jones typecharacter and I will definitely look out for more things she is in.There were some notable other performances but Emilia Clarke reallystood out.I will be recommending this film to my friends.
