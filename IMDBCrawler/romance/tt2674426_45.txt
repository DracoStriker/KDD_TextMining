I loved this film. First of all the characters. Louisa Clarke is just the best characterever, seriously I don't think there can be a person who has watchedthis movie who doesn't like her she is just adorable. She is sweet andfunny with a cute but very quirky dress sense. The relationship betweenher and Will is so beautiful and inspiring. This movie also introduced me to quadriplegia, a condition I had neverheard of before watching this movie. It makes you think about somepretty deep ethical questions too.This movie was kind of like a much less cynical, grown up version ofThe Fault in Our Stars.
