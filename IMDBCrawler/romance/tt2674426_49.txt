I saw this movie today and was not disappointed. The acting, especiallyfrom Emilia Clarke, who played Lou, was brilliant. I also thought SamClaflin, who played Will Traynor, did a very good job. I note thatsomeone has commented that it wasn't as good as the book. I disagree.There were a couple of small parts that were left out but theycertainly did not detract from the movie. It has been a long time sinceI have seen a movie that I have loved as much as this one and wouldrecommend it to anyone who wants to have a laugh, but also be preparedto have a cry as well. I also noted that, from an ethical point ofview, someone gave it a one star rating. I find that very unfairbecause the movie was excellent. That is the person's view because oftheir religion.
