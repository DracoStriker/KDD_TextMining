I've seen The Intouchables, and I feel that this movie is just a copy,with a touch of love story and a dude with a poor mentality. Greatacting, crappy writing as some others in here has pointed out, and therest; blah. I kinda feel the same way as mentioned by others; I mean, he has somuch more to fight for, a great family, great resources and a lot ofmoney that i can basically do whatever he wants in life. That said, Ifeel it sends out a poor message to those in the same situation, justwith the lack of family, resources and money that this guy have. 3/10.
