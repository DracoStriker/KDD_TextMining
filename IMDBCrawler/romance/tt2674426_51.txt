I have to say this is one of the best films I have seen in a long time,ignore the critics and see this film. I cannot express how good it isand how heartwarming the story is. I have seen some heartbreaking filmsin my time like Beaches for instance, but this film from the beginningto the end was truly pulling at the heartstrings, top notchperformances from everyone, this film is definitely a must see, if youwant a Sunday afternoon tear jerk-er look no further than this film, Iwould give it more than 10 if I could. Sam Claflin was by far fantasticin this film along with Emilia Clarke, the soundtrack goes great, Idon't want to say anything about the film or spoilers, but see foryourself how amazing this film is, you will agree it is really a topnotch film for 2016.
