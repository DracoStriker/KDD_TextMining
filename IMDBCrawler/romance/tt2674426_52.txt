I always look for movies that have everything a romantic movie shouldhave. The romantic and chemistry,between the cast. The touch to theviewers,making us feel we are with them. The comedy, to make us laughand smile. And the most important part,the big moment.When we feel thelove between them and we get all the smiles out of us with our hairsgoing up making us feel everything for them and wishing that this loveis real that we could all once feel it with someone else, the partwhere they show you its possible for everyone to find their specialone, the moment when you look at them and just say smile with hope,hoping that they stay together foreverFrom all of this i am saying that this movie is one of the bestromantic movies out there having everything in it and that watchingwill not disappointing.
