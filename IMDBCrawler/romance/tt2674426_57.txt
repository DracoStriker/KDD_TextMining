It would be hard to hold back the tears, once 'Me Before You' movesalong the emotionally-charged course of its unevenly laid-out entirety.Imbued with charismatic flair and some ravishing sentiments, the EmiliaClarke and Sam Clafflin starrer, is every hopeless romantic dream. Itis bound to recreate the familiar 'heaven and earth' trope, with allits utter predictabilities and tiring cheesy clichés, but here, thetears are mostly rightfully earned.Clarke's Lou, emerges as the brightest asset of this manipulativedrama, her buoyant demeanor creates an affectionate atmosphere for thiswhole fairytale-ish attempt whose often leaning towards emotionaltragedy is ever screaming at every turn of the proceedings. Hersprightly charm makes an indispensible compensation for the largelystale performance pulled by Clafflin who plays here, a quadriplegicnear real-life prince, who enlisted the service of Clarke's caregivercharacter. But together they conjure magic, enough to sprinkle theiroften predictable storyline with heart-crippling charm.The biggest flaw of this film, perhaps, is how it seemed written tomanipulate. That is not to say it isn't effective, because in fact itoften works, but you would still think, and wonder, how more beautifulit would have become, had it been written with pure authenticity. Bethat as it may, you've got to give it to those at its helm for moldingan extremely poignant drama, that even if its often undermined by itseasily recognizable motives, isn't devoid of wit, humor, and charm, andjaw-dropping glamor from two of the most beautiful faces to ever starin such romantic tragedy.
