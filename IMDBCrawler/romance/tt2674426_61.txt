I didn't know anything about this movie when I agreed to go and watchit with a group of 8 friends. Well what can I say?? Amazing acting byall involved in a deeply thought provoking story line. An absoluteemotional roller-coaster!! The movie is done so well you can literallysee it from all perspectives. Although we all had a massive cry in thedark, every single one of us loved this movie... I noticed for thefirst time in a long time a huge amount of people remained in theirseats after the movie finished just regathering their thoughts andemotions.. That's how powerful this movie is. If you hadn't read thebook and didn't know what was coming, (as in my case) then you reallydon't see the emotional bombshell coming and which direction this movieis going in. Not your usual predictable happily ever after story whichin itself is brilliantly refreshing.. Highly recommend, howeverremember to take some tissues with you as I believe even the toughestof you will shed at least a tear or two.
