I watched this movie the day after I finished reading the book and washeartbroken by how shallow the movie was. Obviously no movie will beable to contain all of the detail a book can, but "Me Before You" waslacking most of the gravitas that emanated from the book's pages. Ihave no idea how anyone who watched the movie without having read thebook had any idea what was happening, because it jumps from idea toidea without segues or explanations and I had to fill in most of theinformation from what I had read. I love Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones but goodness she was ill-fitfor this role. The Lou of the book evolved from a quirky, shy,small-town girl to a young lady who surprised herself by falling inlove with her employer and working up the courage to try a myriad ofnew things, with his encouragement and help. The Lou of the movie istrite and goofy. Since Emilia seems completely unable to express anyemotion except exhilaration, I spent the majority of the movie cringingat the cheesiness of her acting (especially when crying was involved). The ending, which was supposed to tug at our heartstrings and leave usemotional and sentimental, was completely ruined by Emilia'sperformance.Nathan's character and Will's father's character, for me, stole theshow; they were the only actors who really convinced me of anything.Do yourself a favor and read the book -- skip the movie.
