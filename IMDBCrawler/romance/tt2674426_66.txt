Right away I felt something was off about this film. It had the actors,the acting, and the idea, and I couldn't quite describe why I felt thisway. I was never sure where the film was leading me and couldn'tunderstand the characters or their motivations. Overall it felt veryconfusing, that is until the climax finally came. After reflection Idescribe this film as entirely dishonest with its audience. Thisdishonesty kills the potential for that unrestrained cathartic endingwe all were waiting for. Although, it did spur up quite theconversations and reflections after its viewing, it was not the typesthe conversations the writers clearly tried to push.
