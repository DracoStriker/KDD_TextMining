This film shook me quite a bit. And I might be a chick, but usually I'm not one for chick flicks. Theycan be good to pass the time. At their worst they're flat outoffensive, using serious themes to pretend they're more than theyreally are. Like the misery of the Third World - see 'Beyond Borders".Or cancer, see "The Fault In Our Stars". So when I hear of a chick flick dealing with war or death or sickness,that's what I fear. Flat, mindless characters that are there just tofall in love in spite of everything, because, you know, love conquersall. But for one: for all you could say about Emilia Clarke, she's neverflat. She's lovely. She's a top-notch actress, and I can't imagineanyone who would give this role this much warmth and steadiness. Peoplelike Lou - grown-up children, with both childlike innocence and morewisdom than the rest of us - are a rare breed, but they do exist, andshe captured this perfectly. Her eyebrows are a gift from god. She was the first good thing about "Me Before You". I still wouldn'tremember much of it if it wasn't for the second one - the ending. I'veread a couple of reviews for this film and people seem to get the "liveboldly" slogan as its message. They miss the fact that it's also amovie that debates assisted suicide. And actually argues in favor ofit. As a person who has gone through a debilitating illness, Iappreciate the fact that it doesn't maintain that any life is worthliving or something along those lines. This is something that onlypeople who don't know the first thing about being sick can state - andthat I see mainstream cinema argue much too often. I still don't think it's a good movie. I give it a 6, because most ofit is calculated just to repeat the success of "The Fault In Our Stars"and such. But there was something visceral in it that cracked throughthe Hollywood facade and that cracked me in turn, because I didn'texpect it there. Watch it, somehow it's worth it.
