Me Before You (2016): When I read plot line of Me Before You,I wassurprised to find it exactly similar to the french classic Intouchables(which was remade in Telugu as Oopiri),only in the other way around.Theonly difference is they have given a female lead in the caretaker roleand as usually love blossoms between them even with such physicaldifferences.But the only reason I watched this movie is for my PrincessKhaleesi aka Daenerys Targaryen aka her off screen real name EmiliaClarke.Plot: Louisa Clark (Emilia Clark) is a small town girl who knows a lotabout the people around her. Will (Sam Claflin) a quadriplegic man whohates everyone around him. Louisa is hired by Will's mum to take careof him for six months. Although they have a rocky start, theirrelationship grows over time, going for hate, to like, to love.What I felt: With exactly the same plot and almost same type of sceneslike Intouchables ,Me Before You mostly works on Emilia Clarke'scharming performance.Other than that,this movie has very few feel goodmoments but mostly the screenplay is totally predictable.These movies would only work if it has lot of feel good moments whichcan bring tears but this movie has none literally.The dinner ateClark's home and the scene where Clark and Will dances and the scenewhere they watch a movie are the scenes which are the highlight of themovie.As said earlier,Emilia Clark's charming screen presence helped themovie a lot.But her expressions with eyebrows are weird.It felt likeshe can even move her eyebrows downwards to ;-o.So apart from that shereally is charming and I never even imagined Khaleesi being cute likethis.Sam Claflin,whom I have seen earlier in Love,Rosie is very good in hisrole of a quadriplegic man.Music also helped the movie in lot of scenes.But the major surprise in this film is its daring climax.Most of themwould not accept this ending (Including me to an extent),but as afiction we cannot blame the director/writer.But he could have triedother options because this may affect lot of such disabled personsideology.So,Me Before You works mostly because of Emilia Clark's charming screenpresence and few moments but its climax is shocking.My rating 6.5/10
