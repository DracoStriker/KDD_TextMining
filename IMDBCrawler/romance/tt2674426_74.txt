*** MAJOR SPOILERS *** I thought the acting was great. I adore EmiliaClarke and Sam Claflin. My objection is it seemed to me to be promotingthe assisted suicide movement. I am strongly opposed to that way ofthinking. People have the right to make movies about it, I just didn'tagree with it.I was hoping for an uplifting message of true, lasting love overcomingall of life's possible challenges. This had the potential to be full ofinspiration. I loved the relationships with family and other charactersand how their lives unfolded.I hope to never have to be a part of anything remotely near to Will'ssituation. I am vehemently against taking ones own life. God brought usinto this world and we must rely and depend on him in all situations tothe very end. If Will had faith in his heart, the outcome would havebeen different and he and Louisa could have led a live filled withlove.
