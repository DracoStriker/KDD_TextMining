This has got to be the worst movie I have ever watched. I don't know ifI'm being overly critical due to having recently read the book, but Igenuinely feel that this movie has got to be the worst book to movieadaptation.I thought that nearly every scene was over dramatized. Too much emotionwhere it is not needed.The relationships between several key characters were awkward, therewas no chemistry between them. In particular the relationship betweenLou and Will was terrible, I partially thought that maybe it was theactors that created the poor chemistry. Although I thought thatindividually their acting was brilliant and I love Emilia Clarke, buttogether they did just not work! In fact I was kind of embarrassed forthem. Lou and Treena's relationship was also all wrong! Poor casting ofJenna Coleman as Treena.I was absolutely appalled by the errors in the story line. There weretoo many changes that effected the way that the characters areportrayed. Key ideas and events were often squeezed into the samesentence where in the book the same ideas were spread throughout. Someevents were left out entirely. Multiple events were merged into one.Things that were done or said by a certain character were then said bya different character. And, there were characters missing alltogether!! Will's sister Georgie?? I appreciate that it is probablydifficult to fit a whole book into the time of a movie but I feel thatin this case it has been poorly done. Vital information is missing thatwould have been critical to character development and would have helpedrefine the whole movie!I had high hope for this movie after reading what turned out to be anabsolute page turner of a book, but I have been left miserablydisappointed.
