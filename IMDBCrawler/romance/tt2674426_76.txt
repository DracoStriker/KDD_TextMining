Featuring the strange proposition of The Mother of Dragons living alife where she cares for the tragically paralysed son of TywinLannister, Me Before You is 2016's attempt at becoming "the bigromantic hit" as debut director Thea Sharrock adapts Jojo Moyes wellliked book of the same name, which is in turn a rejigged version of the2011 hit The Intouchables into a totally over the top and highlyoverdone romantic drama.In what's her highest profile gig outside of the 6 seasons of playingGame of Thrones beloved dragon mother, Brit star Emilia Clarke goesnext level of loving life as the seemingly carefree and unflappablestocking loving Lou Clark who takes up the job of becoming a friend toThe Hunger Games Sam Claflin's quadriplegic Will Traynor, that will inturn see the two fall tragically in love as Will contemplates endinghis now unfortunately paralysed life.It's an intriguing idea, if not totally original and there's potentialhere for many tears, laughs and smiles but everything withinSharroack's film feels either forced, full of fakery or misjudgedemotional manipulations as Clarke in particular suffers from her rolein the film that allows her to go completely wild with herunfortunately annoying and coy Lou and it really does beg the questionof how much of a career she may have outside of the GOT universe if shecontinues on in this fashion.Lou Clark may just be last year's most intolerable creation, as whilewe all love someone that sees the brighter side of life, this issomething else entirely as Clarke and her eyebrows, over extended smileand genuine ADHD tendencies trample the films chances as Lou and Will'srelationship turns from forced friendship to genuine love.Clarke needed to dial back her role especially as Claflin gives his allas Will (even if you've never seen a quadriplegics body looked quitethis toned before) and while the film clearly connected with itsready-made target audience as evidenced by its respectable world-widebox office and audience ratings, it's unlikely that many will beremembering the hard fought romance of Lou Clark and Will Traynor aswe'd remember the Noah and Allie's or Edward Lewis and Vivian Wards ofthe movie universe.A refreshingly kind spirited movie that just never connects emotionallyor engages thanks to a so-so structure and a completely misguidedfemale centrepiece, Me Before You will be a favourite to those thatloved the movie before they even saw it but for the rest of us, thissappy, cringe-worthy and forgettable romance just doesn't cut theromantic mustard.2 fit Neville Longbottom's out of 5
