Might be some spoilers.I loved the whole story, it is brilliant. Well, it is standard story:hating the whole world disabled person and the charming and cheerfulone, who takes care of another. But Will's will to choose that way ofthe remaining 'life' was crushing both mine and Louisa's hearts. Heshould've found strength in himself to live. Doesn't matter if in painor constant agony. At least he should've lived for her. All of us sawthat they fell in love. I hate people who choose to be selfish, to makethemselves priority number one, because they are tired. The world andlife doesn't work that way. You must want to live.I have been sobbing my ass off for an hour straight. I would have givenan A+++, but Will's decision made it to the damn F-. Even the name ofthe movie says it all, how he loves or loved HIMSELF BEFORE (theaccident and later) HER. My tears are out of fierceness.Anyway. Worth watching, but be prepared. And prepare some tissues foryour running nose.Cheers,BUPD: I slept really bad the night after seeing the movie. Woke upcrying like a baby and can't stop doing it. It is infuriating.
