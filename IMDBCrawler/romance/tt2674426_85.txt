My wife and I were very impressed at the beginning of this movie, andthrough the middle. We grew a bit uncomfortable when the young girlfinds out the fellow in the wheelchair has decided to kill himself(through assisted suicide). At the end of the movie we both felt verylet down. Not only did she not succeed in changing his mind, sheactually becomes happy about it as if life is only lived for momentswhen you can really experience something.Sad, sad, commentary on life, and very narrow minded. First, I know acouple people who have been injured and confined to wheelchair,quadriplegic or otherwise. They took the time to adjust, and one hasbeen that way for near 40 years and has a wonderful life. He did notquit or give up on life, just because his life before the accident wasso "Tremendous" or whatever it was the wimpy dude said in this movie.If you want to make a movie about someone with redemption or aboutovercoming adversity, then you had best not have the person quit at theend, like a whiny cry-baby and try to convince everyone out there that"The world is better off without me because I hate my life now, butloved it before..." That's a cop out, totally and completely. It's notan ad for assisted suicide, it's just a dramatic interpretation of adude who gave up, and let everyone down.We gave it 8/10 for acting. But, the overall movie is a 2 since thepremise and the interpretation are so wrong. So, it gets a total scoreof 4/10 compromise from us.
