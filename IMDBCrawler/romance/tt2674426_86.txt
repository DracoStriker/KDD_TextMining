Me before you stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and its the story ofa woman (Emilia Clarke) and her story of how she falls in love with aman that cannot move either his legs and his arms. Emilia Clarke isamazing as her character, she completely became her character. I cannotthink of another actress that will portray her character, well DaisyRidley can because Emilia Clarke's performance did remained me of her.Sam Claflin was serviceable, he can easily be replaced. The story isreally what drives this movie to the top. The relationship between Louand Will is great, you really believe that they are in love. The musicis used appropriately, only one time it annoyed me but it was once andit did not take me out of the film. The cinematography was great aswell as the production design. The biggest problem i have with thisfilm its is 3 act. It is really cheesy and makes the cliché that oneperson gets mad with one another, and you know they're gonna get backtogether and its just lazy writing. Its not awful but it ain't goodeither. Also since Emilia Clarke is so fantastic as her character, itsreally distracting when she is not in a scene, and you kind off getlost in the story. Other than that, I found that Me Before You was agreat film about love, relationships and letting go. Beautiful visualsand an unique script made this film the best love story of 2016 (sofar). 8/10
