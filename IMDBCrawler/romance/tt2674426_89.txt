I'm so glad that I was able to finally watch this lovely film. I'veseen some rather harsh critiques however this film came along at theright time. With all the glare and harshness going on in the outsideworld, it's nice to escape into someone else's world. I rememberlistening to my grandparents tell about going to Grand movie theatersduring the Depression as an escape from the everyday. There's a truecompassion in this film and it seems to have been done with the lot oflove. As for the issue of the film allegedly condoning assistedsuicides because of the perceived burden is just a bunch of moose caca!I've been a caregiver for many years and whatever Faith or moral Viewone has, we all have to accept that it is the choice of the person andferfuxssake give them dignity! Make judgments when you find yourself inthat position and not until. People need to stop sharing what they feeland take action upon what they think.
