Emilia Clarke is cute and totally lovable in this film, portraying aquirky character who is all heart. And I can understand why girls might swoon over Sam Claflin, even when(SPOILER ALERTS) wheelchair bound.Despite the tragic background, this is a delightful film that, whileraising very serious issues, focuses on the personalities and how theyinteract. The result is often very funny, but also very moving.Consequently, I am saddened by the reaction of some people, but it alsohelps me to understand the Trumpist backlash against the 'thoughtpolice' in American society. Because unfortunately there are somepeople who are not content to allow others to watch a film and formtheir own opinions about the issues portrayed. They want to tell themhow to feel and how to think and it is heretical if the film allows theviewers to come to conclusions that may differ from their own. If thefilm does not specifically embrace their own views and values then theywill try to harm it at the box office by driving people away throughtheir rabid criticism.Fortunately, this film is way above that putrid level and can beenjoyed both as entertainment (comedy, drama & romance) and for themeaningful questions about life that it raises. I found it comparableto "Whose Life Is It Anyway" and even better than "The Intouchables".
