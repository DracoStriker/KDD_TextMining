A wonderful movie even for people who are not fans of romantic films.It's not groundbreaking or particularly challenging for the viewer, butit's definitely entertaining and sweet. Both Sam Claflin and EmiliaClarke are charming as Will Traynor and Louisa Clarke and they dojustice to their book counterparts, although they do get a littlecheesy towards the end but I think it's just the writers' fault.Anyway, the film is beautifully shot, the soundtrack is perfect and ingeneral the writing is good and adequately smart, so I can forgive afew cheesy lines here and there. As far as the controversy that arose over the way the film ends and itstreatment of the disabled, well.. If a man choosing to end his life onhis own terms is offensive then so be it. I personally think it fit thecharacter's arrogant and stubborn personality even though I'd prefer an'easy' and satisfactory happy ending. But then again, if there was ahappy ending, there would be a whole new bunch of complaints about thestupid love-conquers-all cliché, or how Will's parents and Lou would bepatronizing him, or any other crap that someone might think of. I doagree that representation of people with disabilities should be better.BUT that is not this movie's problem.
