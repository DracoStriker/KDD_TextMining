Well I like the romcom genre and this started off looking good. Clarkes big big grin and big big eyebrows did actually work in thispoor girl takes a job to look after rich, handsome, throughly disabledand suicidal guy Will Traynor (Claflin) The story had the potential for an lot of depth. Traynor plans to go toSwitzerland to be euthanised but promised his parents to wait 6 monthsto see if his outlook on his life (such as it was) changes. Clarke isbrought in as a minder/suicide watch person. There are issues that the film could have covered, much much better,rich versus poor, euthanasia, disability etc I couldn't help but wonder if the roles were reversed, i.e. the poorperson was the wheel chair bound quadroplegic. ? But no that would befar too miserable. Instead the makers chose to go for cheesy and safe mushy love story,where even the poor, aren't that poor, etc. A rather Disney wash onwhat could have been a serious but funny, tragic thought provokingmovie. The acting was OK but I could not say anyone stuck out as great. If Ihad to pick anyone, it was Stephen Peacock as the male nurse. He didgive an air of gritty reality to what otherwise ends as Mills & Boonromantic slush. Watch once, probably twice if you feel like a good old Mills & Boon boohoo, don't forget your tissues.
