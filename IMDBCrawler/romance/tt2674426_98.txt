A good movie doesn't have to be either bad or good at the end of it.This movie show me that sometimes, a movie just need to end the way itis. That's just how it should be.How Lou react to Will's explanation about ending his life, is notright. What could you expect from a paralyzed man that already live theawesome life before? Don't be a selfish movie viewer, we can enjoy lovestory about Will & Lou for 2 hours movie, but imagine how Will's lifeif he need to continue his next 50 years of life that way? That's why,i think the movie ended the way it should.Be grateful with your life, live it.
