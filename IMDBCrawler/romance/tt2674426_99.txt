I have absolutely no words for this movie, so dramatic, romantic,devastatingly sad all at the same time. The actors did more thanfantastic job, they brought the protagonists to life. It literally leftme speechless. I'm typically not someone who likes romantic movies,mostly because it is often too much with those well known quotes, butTHIS. So powerful, I believe it would bring the strongest and mostclearheaded to tears. All my recommendations go to it (make sure youprepare some tissues :) )
