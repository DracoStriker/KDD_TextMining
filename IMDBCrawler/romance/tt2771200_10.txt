Bad movie for sure. Disney movies are most of the times one of the bestI have ever seen, but not always this is true which is the case here.This movie was so boring so I was wandering what to do 1 hour and 50minutes, only the last 10 minutes of the movie is worth seeing. Budget160 millions dollars and the result is total disappointment. All thismusical elements in the movie is just too much, it takes away the realfeeling that this movie is supposed to bring to the viewers. Ema Watsonclearly is worst choice for this role, she was looking like Beast'sdaughter when standing next to him, she is just too young for thisrole. This movie should be rated not to be viewed by viewers over 16years of age. Overall very bad movie, it is a clear waste of time tosee this movie, but we will forget Disney and will wait for them to getback on track this month of May.
