Once again I was convinced that Hollywood is dead. First of all, mainthe Beast and the Beast auditory are kids and teenagers from age 6 toage 18. So no big expectation for adult auditory. It is not supposed tobe masterpiece of all times. But even so... how you could misrepresenthistorical facts like that? Medieval France. What we see? Black peoplelived freely among white people, they dance happily together and drinkin one bar. I understand things about political correctness. But don'tyou think it makes movie look fake and misrepresent original fairytale. Secondly, music. Did you actually hire song writers, authors, musiciansfor such big cinema event? There are some good songs. But it turned outthey are all classic French songs or taken from 1991 animated "Thebeauty and the beast" movie.Thirdly, actors. Well, I have no complains to Emma Watson beauty.Interesting young British actress. But Belle was French. French womenhave special charm and chic(remember Amelie?). Emma Watson with hersolder walking and always the same face expression did not convince me.Animated Belle expressed more emotions and love in her eyes that Emma"Belle" Watson. As for other actors, was very pleased to see KevinKline. Only actor in the movie which performance I enjoyed. Otheractors were very plain or their roles were so short that it is hard todo something outstanding.
