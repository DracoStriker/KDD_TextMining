I must say, Disney seems to be putting out live action movies of theirsuccessful cartoons just for the sake of putting out live actionmovies! I guess corporate thinking is the initial buzz will make itmoney on the first weekend! This is the worst of the live actions, theacting is boring, the story mundane, I do not care about the charactersat all, it seems it's just made to show how cool Disney can use specialeffects! If you like the story, stick to the original cartoon!
