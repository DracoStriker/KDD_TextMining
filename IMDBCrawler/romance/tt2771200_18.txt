The movie is bad. My now grown kids went with the wife and I. Kids wifeand I loved the cartoon version some 25 plus years back. This moviedon't compare in any way. Kids are also life long Harry Potter fans andthought they loved Emma Watson they went truly wishing to love thismovie they left feeling there money was stolen and swearing off Disney.I felt I was stuck on a 2 hour lecture about the greatness of being aliberal and found the movie sickening. Hey to each there own but I wishnever wasted a penny on this movie and I am a life long cartoon and kidmovie fan
