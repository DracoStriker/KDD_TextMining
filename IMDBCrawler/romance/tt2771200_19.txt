My title says it all. Even with releasing nude photos of herself andplaying it up as a 'hack' Emma Watson fails to deliver in thispredictable, cliché, gyno-centric feminist's wet dream of a reboot.You'd think Hollywood would stop trying to dictate what the audiencefinds entertaining, but it seems nobody in Hollywood wants to make anymoney anymore. Maybe the film / television industry is going the way ofthe music industry. Maybe it should, the 'talent' has been full ofthemselves for far too long now.
