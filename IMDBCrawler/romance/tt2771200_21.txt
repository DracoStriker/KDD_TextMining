Overall the film was decent, a bit boring at times. The acting was OK,but it failed to ever "sweep you away" like the animated version didfor years. The most frustrating part was Belle, or Emma. I don't dislike her and Icould care less about feminism. However, I do think a lead role thatincludes substantial signing should be able to.......SING!The horrible use of auto-tune was cringe worthy and her English accentwas very thick for someone that was born in Paris and grew up inFrance.... I though McGregor was great as Lumiere and hid his English accent well.Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth are supposed to be English, so that workedwell.
