This movie is very overrated and the reason why the film is popularbecause of its promotion. Emma Watson performance is really boring ashell and her voice is not that good. I suggest you to watch theoriginal version (1991). Dan Stevens and Luke Evans performance ispretty good tho. Overall, its the worst Disney film i've ever watched.
