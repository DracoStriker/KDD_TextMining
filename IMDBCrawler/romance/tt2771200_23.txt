All these good reviews, all the praise, my local magazine reviewed itin glowing terms and watching it last night (and I even dragged my veryunwilling boyfriend too) it felt like a copy. Yes, I know you arelaughing it is already a remake and yet another Beauty And The Beat,but this is so similar to the one from the 90s we have all watched thatyou will be sitting there asking 'what is the point?' Still, prettysure Disney doesn't care they got two tickets out of us, but if youread this it is nothing new or different and the inclusion of aso-called gay character is so irrelevant to the story and so ungay thatit makes no difference. If you have seen the multiple other Beauty AndThe Beasts out there (animated or not) you have seen this. Disney mustbe really hard up for cash. Do anything else, go out for dinner, cookfor your man, let him take you in front of the window, read a book,update your keek or just unwind... you'd be ahead.
