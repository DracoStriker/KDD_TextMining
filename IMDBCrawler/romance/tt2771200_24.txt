If it were in a theater rather than a cinema, it would have been great.But the fact is we saw this before when it was called Beauty & theBeast.The songs we all heard before. Rather than an animated background youhave a computer animated background but we have still seen it before.We sit down and pay to watch a movie we already saw turn live actionand follow the same plot, the same game, as the movie we fell in lovewith oh so many years ago.We are living in an era for that, but we still want it to change atleast a little.Like all remakes it is dull and boring and utterly mindless. Like allremakes it makes changes that are unnecessary and irritating and insome cases, fairly insulting to the fans of the original: Belle, nother father, is the eccentric town inventor and that would, maybe, workif he wasn't supposed get locked up for being, well, the eccentric towninventor with a story about a Beast.Take away the establishment of one character that is sort of necessaryto the plot and give it to another where it is less important toadvance the story and do it only because, well, it's a remake, you haveto find at least one way to really insult the fans...And changes like this are the only way to do it because, otherwise, youhave the EXACT same movie you saw before with little changes made toreally just drag the monotony out as much as you can.I hate remakes, but the fact that it IS THE SAME MOVIE just makes it somuch more monotonous to watch than your average remake.
