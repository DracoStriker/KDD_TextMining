I don't know where to begin. beauty and the beast Had so much potentialto be an extraordinary movie. THe village set was disappointing,everything in the movie looked fake. The beast looked like a plasticmask, the wolves I can't even begin to say. I'm honestly justdisappointed in the movie. Only part I truly enjoy was the "be ourguest" performance. honestly should've left this movie alone. It mademe feel like I was watching those teen vampire movies( which I don'twatch).
