I've seen the original more times than I can count so I was veryexcited when I heard about a live action version that sticks to theoriginal movie. While they did stick to the original for a goodportion, they changed many of the most iconic scenes and not in a goodway. For example, they cut out the scene where Belle's father firstencounters the beast by the fireplace, which is my son's favorite, andreplaced it with something far less interesting. They also managed, andI don't know how, to ruin the music. All of the songs are slowed downso much that it's hard to care about them and they're lacking thebooming vocals that made the originals so good. They also added a lotof unnecessary dialogue which makes for a much slower pace. Overall allthis movie just lacks the character of the original. We were so boredthat we actually left about half way through.
