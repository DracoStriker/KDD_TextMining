Emma Watson should not have been cast as Belle, first of all she is farfrom being a beauty she is average looking not to mention she has nosinging experience. Emmy Rossum who is both a beauty and a fantasticsinger should have been cast as Belle, she actually looks like her. Thecasting is ridiculous, her voice is sub par and does no credit to theoriginal movie, im going to pretend this remake doesn't exist, thecasting of Gaston was also absurd....not to mention the adding ofstrange dialogue that is not even in the original movie, the wholecasting was ridiculous but Emma Watson does no credit to Belle and isone of the biggest casting mistakes ever made! my favourite fairy talebut not movie.
