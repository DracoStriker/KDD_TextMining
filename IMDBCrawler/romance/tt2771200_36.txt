First I want to say that I have been waiting for too many years hopingthat Disney will make my favorite Cartoons in real movies; but when Iwent to the movies and I saw beauty and the beast I was verydisappointed.I expected to see something beautiful, like the work theydid with Cinderella. Why they didn't chose the same director. Thismovie would have been huge!. I was sad. My little daughter was scaredof the beast. She is 7 years old and kept crying. This is supposed tobe a family movie. This movie didn't meet my expectations at all.Actors didn't show emotion while acting. It looks fake. I'm sorry; butit was disappointing.
