I really wanted to like the live action version of Beauty and theBeast. I was obsessed with the animated version growing up as a kid. Iwent to see it in theaters on New Year's 1991. My main complaint isthat I believe Belle was miscast. I like Emma Watson, but I think thecharacter of Belle would have been portrayed better by someone who isless known, or who is not mostly known from playing one character. Another thing I didn't like is that the film is supposed to be liveaction but everything about the film is so over produced that nothingseems real. The parts that were added or changed that moved away from the originalwere boring and didn't convey the spirit that the original had. It's hard to make some aspects of the film live action (Chip, Mrs.Potts, etc.) however Lumiere and Cogsworth were downright creepy.
