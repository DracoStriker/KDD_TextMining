Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear: where should I start folks. I had lowexpectations already because I hated each and every single trailer sofar, but boy did Disney make a blunder here. I'm sure the film willstill make a billion dollars - hey: if Transformers 11 can do it, whynot Belle? - but this film kills every subtle beautiful little thingthat had made the original special, and it does so already in the veryearly stages. It's like the dinosaur stampede scene in Jackson's KingKong: only with even worse CGI (and, well, kitchen devices instead ofdinos).The worst sin, though, is that everything (and I mean reallyEVERYTHING) looks fake. What's the point of making a live-actionversion of a beloved cartoon if you make every prop look like a prop? Iknow it's a fairy tale for kids, but even Belle's village looks like ithad only recently been put there by a subpar production designer tryingto copy the images from the cartoon. There is not a hint ofauthenticity here. Unlike in Jungle Book, where we got great lookingCGI, this really is the by-the-numbers version and corporate filmmakingat its worst. Of course it's not really a "bad" film; those 200 millionblockbusters rarely are (this isn't 'The Room' after all), but it's soinfuriatingly generic and dull - and it didn't have to be. In the handsof a great director the potential for this film would have been huge.Oh and one more thing: bad CGI wolves (who actually look even worsethan the ones in Twilight) is one thing, and the kids probably won'tcare. But making one of the two lead characters - Beast - look equallybad is simply unforgivably stupid. No wonder Emma Watson seems to phoneit in: she apparently had to act against an guy with a green-screen inthe place where his face should have been.
