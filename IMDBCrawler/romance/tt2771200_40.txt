I went into the movie expecting an uninspired, yet beautifully animatedmovie that is exactly like the old animated one, just remade as a lifeaction. Nothing exceptional, but nice to look at and maybe to get a bitnostalgic. If you expect that, you can forget it.What i got was: Strange CGI: the characters, especially the servantslooked plastic and almost creepy.Some new information about the characters background stories (Belle'sMom) that were nice but didn't go into dept at all.Old scenes remade, often they took all the atmosphere out of them,(like in the final battle, remember how epic it was, it rained andGaston hit that statue while trying to find beast, and beast was movingaround like a shadow, in the new version it lacks the suspense)Bad singing technique: It often sounded rushed, emotionless and tooserious. Also auto-tuned :((( is it so hard to get experienced singersthat you need to make the computer do the trick? I was prepared not tobe overjudgemental, but as the first singer opened their mouth, all Icould do was shake my head. That is not good quality. (I am referringto the German cast)Rushed moments and sloppy dialogue,Bad humour: Some jokes were funny, but most of the time I was like,"that was the most stupid thing I heard today, oh wait, it just gottopped"Emma Watson, who could kill a bear with her bare hands in a movie andI'd believe it, but her longing look at the end and her being a dreamyperson... I don't buy it.This was my impression, but hey, we all have different views on theworld, so check it for yourself, if you don't believe me :psomething positive at the end: I liked LeFou, this actor was a greatchoice.
