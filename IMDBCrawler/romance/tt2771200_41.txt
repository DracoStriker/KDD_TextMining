"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should." I'm sure this won't be the last time I say this, but it needs to besaid: Stop making movie musicals with people who can't sing. If theycan't sing, drop the Autotunes and dub them. We have the technology;it's virtually painless. Non-singing actors have ruined 3 of myfavorite musicals: Beauty & the Beast, Sweeney Todd, and Phantom of theOpera. In a musical, music is a character, and hearing Josh Groban sing"Evermore" over the end credits merely proved what was missing. The overuse of CGI in films is creating a nightmare of quick cut, inyour face visuals that are detracting from the overall story and quitefrankly, giving me a headache. Again, CGI should enhance, not overtakeyour scenes and wrestle them and your actors into the ground. The sameCGI that made "Be Our Guest" a thing of beauty in the 1991 versioncreates an on-screen, muddled mess here. In fact, the CGI detractedrather than enhanced this entire production. The cartoon charactersshowed more emotion than the flat, emotionless, and rather frighteningfaces here. I'd rather not comment on the acting because it's hard to do that andnot hurt people's feelings, and at the end of the day, actors arepeople, too. I will say that there is a reason Disney is now seriouslyrecognizing and marketing their Villains. THEY ROCK. Oh, and KevinKline gets a pass because I love him. :-) While others may love it, it simply wasn't my cup of tea.
