The original was a part of my childhood so I was excited for this movieever since I heard about it. I did have some concerns though. Concernsthat were present in every minute of this movie. A disappointment butthe thing that I was most surprised by was there was no heart. Goodactors and very little chemistry hurt this movie. However it will stillmake a billion dollars so I'm sure Disney will be fine. Disney iskicking so much butt that even their bad movies destroy at the boxoffice.
