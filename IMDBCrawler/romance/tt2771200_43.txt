(Spoilers ahead, possibly)As much as I love Disney, shame on them for insisting on modernizingclassic animated movies by making live-action remakes. From the momentI heard of this movie being in production, a part of me knew that itwould never measure up to the beloved 1991 film, yet try to compensatefor this fact with some *grand* musical numbers and better developedelements of the story and characters...This movie, in my opinion, is just okay, and I would not mind neverwatching it after that first viewing (save for a few scenes toward theend). In my opinion, B&tB tries a bit too hard to impress viewers of anew generation (predictable), and the use of auto-tune on the femalelead was annoying and unnecessary (none of that that rubbish, or castan actress who can actually sing well!) The new songs enhance the storybut are altogether unmemorable. The live-action versions of Mrs. Pottsand the rest of the enchanted objects looked so dainty and realistic,it was creepy and "unmagical" to me. As for the main characters, thewriters did not even seem to give Gaston a chance. He was deeplyunlikable from the beginning, so his characterization was not verywell-rounded in this version (villains deserve even a bit oflove/empathy).There are enough remakes/reboots being made nowadays, and I find itupsetting that Disney ended up tampering with one of its classics. Thismovie is a bit of a disappointment. Listen to the other reviewersstating you would be better off re-watching the original.
