OK, I really love the animated movie so I was hoping so much it will begreat live action. Even I didn't watch the trailer because I wanted tobe surprised. But then, I'm so disappointed.First, why they changed Ms. Pott nose? That's her characteristic. Two,why they need to add stories. The prince's parents story is finebecause I've been wondering about his parents before. But Belle'smother and reason why her father didn't talked about her mother? Notreally.. I don't think it's necessary to tell people that for all thistime her father not talking about her mother to her. Three, why need tochange the stories? Her father being left in the woods? Belle and herfather not being saved by Chip and their washing machine? And the lastbattle? People vs living furniture is my fave scene because it's soepic and in this film it's just "that's it?" and why need to change the'cute Beast playing with bird in the snow' with 'playing with horse'?And last, Belle's changes. Belle is so beautiful and elegant, brave butgentle. In here, they changed her to not be woman enough. I know theywanted Belle looked strong but why need to remove her elegance? What'sher doing with her skirt? Belle's dress is classic but in here it's sosimple. It's gold not yellow. And oh my, Emma Watson really RUINEDBelle by her acting. No emotion at all. Did she want to challengeKristen Stewart with 'no emotion' acting? And why she's still usingBritish accent? This movie background is in France. If Belle's British,where's her father's accent?Oh I'm so angry, they ruined my childhood movie. I have another fewcomplaints but I already said much. The best of this movie is onlyLumiere that's why I still gave 3/10.
