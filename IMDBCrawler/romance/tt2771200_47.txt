Cast was created and worked hard. I seen the movie and enjoyed it. AllI hear from ratings these days from people is hatred, spoiled brats,and bunch of stuck ups. If you don't like the movie and you have tobash people that still worked hard on set, then you should go act onthe movie set and close your disgraceful mouths of outrageous childishbehavior. They worked on hard on set, I like the movie, and theromance. Still stuff to be liked. You reviewers outta be ashamed ofyour selves with such childish review.
