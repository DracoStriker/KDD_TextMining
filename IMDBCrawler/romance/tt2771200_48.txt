Frankly, this new live-action version of "Beauty and the Beast" was oneof the bigger disappointments in recent memory, eclipsed only by howmuch I disliked "Kong: Skull Island" just last week. There is so muchapparent hard work showing on screen and audibly, with gorgeouscostumes and a beautifully-orchestrated and performed musical score(the orchestra's part in it), but it barely registered for me as anengaging, exciting, vibrant, or touching film--the exact opposite ofthe pure, exhilarating joy that was the all-animated "Beauty and theBeast" this is being compared to. I love musicals, have since I was akid, and paid extra to see this new live-action version in alarge-format theater known for great sound and picture near me--and itwas a huge waste of money at nearly $15 a ticket. I found myselfstudying the costuming and just listening to the orchestral score topass the time, and lamenting the CGI-animated Beast's walks, leaps, anddancing, as it was so herky-jerky it felt like old stop-motionanimation throughout (which, ironically, was somehow more effective inits obviousness). There is so much more to complain about, but I'llstop here--just know that I wanted to love this film, wanted to betransported the way musicals sometimes do transport audiences so well,and ended up fidgety and bored, checking my watch to see how muchlonger it could possibly be.
