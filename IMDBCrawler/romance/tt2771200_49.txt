It was actually one of the best movies i have ever seen. And I do notcare about the other mixed opinions of other people. And I really donot care about the cartoon. The movie was great and nothing can add tothat. And to all the haters: Why don't you just watch something elseand stop complaining the movie was *Monotone voice* "One of the worstDisney movies I have ever seen." Just nobody cares OK? You will justdisgust the other people who liked the movie or just make the hatershappy. I really do not know but it's not OK. Just stop. And don't comeback
