Had high hopes for this film since it was my fave as a child plus withit being a timeless classic. Came out with mixed views. I thought theoverall cast seemed forced and a bit bland for the most part andgenerally didn't do the original characters justice from a personalityside of things, I was really hoping to see Cogsworth and Lumiere bickerwith each other a lot more as I remember in the Animation. Overallacting and singing of all was OK throughout but lacking convincingemotion. My favourite character was Gastarn . The sequences of scenes were jumpy and didn't blend very well andscript was word from word to the original which was OK but it couldn'thave hurt to add a few extras to make it more fluid and natural. Overall like others have said it could have been a big success butpersonally I'd stick to the original.
