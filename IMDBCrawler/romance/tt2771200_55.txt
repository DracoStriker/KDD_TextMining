So this is Disney's latest attempt at making one of their animatedclassics a live action classic, and while it doesn't reach theincredibly high bar the original set I still found it pretty enjoyable.What really impressed me about this film were the visuals and theacting. This movie is just gorgeous to look at, the sets are just sogrand in size that you can't help but become mesmerized by it, and theeffects for the Beast and his servants were very well integrated intothe live action. It also didn't hurt that the movie had an amazingcast; Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad just nail eachof their characters and I never thought of the characters as beingplayed by actors, I thought of them as the same characters from theoriginal and that's impressive acting right there. Do that's what Iliked about Beauty and the Beast but there are two flaws with thisflick. Alright so remember all the positive things I just said aboutthe film because I'm about to say something that will make most peoplereally mad, Emma Watson's singing was dull. Watson did a nice job inthe acting category but when it came time to sing it didn't sound likeshe was really getting into it, it sounded like someone with littlemusical background reading the lyrics and trying way too hard to proveshe can sing, not bad singing just dull singing. With that being saidthe rest of the cast did do a nice job with the musical parts, I hateto single out Watson as the one singer who didn't nail the singing butthat is the case, and because she does the majority of the singing inthe film it does bring the movie down a notch. So overall I really didlike this film, it had good acting and nice visuals, and even though itmight have lacked originality and not all the songs were masterpiecesit is still a fun adaptation that respects its source material, and Iwould definitively recommend people see it if they haven't already.
