I wish they had chosen a real actress to portrait Belle - not justsomeone who is there only because she is famous. I wish I had seen anactress who has talent and can actually act, sing and show emotion andsome effort into the role.The original movie was amazing, and it has always been one of myfavorite Disney movies! Disappointed.
