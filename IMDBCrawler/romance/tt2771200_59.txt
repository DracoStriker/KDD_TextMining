Never seen any previous version. So I get to give a unbiased view.The music is the worst turn off for this film, the lyrics wereinstantly forgettable, the score was boring and the main leads voicewas far too over produced and stripped of the human aspects that reallycarry a performance. It had nice costumes, the cgi was passable though I felt cheated at theend when all the characters changing happened off camera - safeoption.. but boring.Acting was a little forced but fine, the pace felt OK.The overall feel of the movie was mildly entertaining.
