I didn't want to see this movie because I felt it was going to be anexact play by play of the 1991 animated film. And I was right. It was alive action version of the animated film done exactly the same way.Nothing changed and what was added was completely forgettable and Ijust didn't care. I like Emma Watson but in this her acting felt forcedand I think she was miscast. I didn't buy that she was in love with thebeast and I didn't buy that the beast was in love with her. Speaking ofwhich the CGI for the beast and everything else I thought was justhorrible, cringe worthy, and distracting.The beast was not a beast at all and what I mean by that is I wasn'tfrightened or disturbed, he even had a musical number that I alsothought was cringe worthy. The beast in the animated version wasbeastly, terrifying, stubborn and you hated him, so it was greatwatching him transition and change into a softer gentler beast.I did like moments like seeing how the castle curse effected not onlythe beast but how it effected the staff and so forth. Every time a rosepetal fell the characters slowly became more and more like antiques soI felt somewhat sympathetic.The music and the score were also good but other than that there'snothing else I can really say about this movie. Its not memorable Iwouldn't watch it twice. Its the same exact movie just go watch theanimated version its leagues better.
