My full review can be read here:www.havekidwillteardrop.comWalking out all I could think was "WOW!". This movie is everything theanimated version was and so much more!The live action movie follows the animated movie very closely. It hasbeen a little bit since I saw the animated version, but I didn't noticeanything missing from the original. The live action version has a fewextra scenes than the animated version which adds to the backstory. Ireally thought these scenes were an excellent addition.I really loved this movie and it surpassed my expectations. I was alittle worried about a live action movie after always loving theoriginal - I wasn't sure it would measure up. The music was wonderfuland the new songs that have been added compliment the originalsoundtrack perfectly. The costumes are wonderfully colorful and brightand scenes are beautiful. Cinematography and the CGI effects were alsovery good and felt seamless. There are so many things that make movies uniquely Disney and thosequalities were evident in this movie too. The "Be Our Guest" scene hadme flashing back to Fantasia for instance, and the overall magic of thefilm in all of it's beauty could really only be Disney. I highly recommend this film.
