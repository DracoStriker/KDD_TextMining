I was a little unsure of how I would like it. I was a child when theanimated movie came out, and you know. Wondering if they would do itjustice. But, I was pleasantly surprised. It mixed a bit of nostalgia,with a bit of new. It also gave a bit more depth to Belle, and herfather, and I rather liked that. Worth watching. Worth owning.
