I loved this movie but lost count of the numerous plagiarisms in themovie Having seen many movies if one pays attention one will recognizein one form or another snippets from many other movies and songs Justsome of the snippets I heard and saw Petes dragon My Fair Lady StarWars Mama Mia Cabaret Titanic There were plenty others but I was moreinterested in watching the movie than noting the Cheats Overall it wasa very good movie following the story I grew up with Very close to theOriginal Some of the CGI Graffics were a little to fast making onedizzy with the movements I loved it Emma Watson is a pleasure to listento and to behold All the acting was good and Gaston was trulyNauseating as was his side kick until the end with his change of heartHe did have plenty qualms as to Gastons behavour8/10 definitely If you enjoy musicals and the story of Beauty and theBeast Then this is for you I personally am not too fond of musicalsexcept for a select few people specially when the singing is immaterialand bears no relation the actual subject which many musicals are Notonly that but many musical songs don't fit the story very well Unless asong fits in and is appropriate then it should not be in the musicalPeople around those singing don't match what is going on Sometimes theyshould react differently but they just seem to ignore thesinger/singers This movie Fortunately does not fall into that trap
