I wanted to see the old classic brought to life again and that'sexactly what I got! It was enchanting, the character choices wereperfect (Especially Gaston!) The songs are just a perfect throwbackwhich has few new tunes thrown in that were amazing! It is a stunningfilm with beautiful costume designs with a few new parts added in tothe tale as old as time. It is fun, entertaining (perhaps a little longto keep a young child's attention) but overall it is a new classic thatI personally prefer to the 90's Disney animation.
