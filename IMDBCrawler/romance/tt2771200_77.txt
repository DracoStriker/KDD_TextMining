My first thought of a real life film Beauty and the Beast I thoughtdisaster was gonna brew. I have been disappointed before with remakesespecially to Disney classics. And hearing that Emma Watson was gonnaplay the lead I was like "No, no! Please no" She's Hermione Grangerfrom Harry Potter and nothing more. So it was pretty intense to see thesocial media talk about it and hear their own opinions. But when thefirst photo came out for Emma as "Belle" I was blown away and mythoughts changed to hopefulness. As time came to see the trailers Ibraced myself yet again. "Would they stay true to the Disney classic ortotally take it on a opposite roller coaster?" When it came out I wastotally moved and in tears of joy. They did everything as they possiblycould to make it real, and true to the Disney version. Little changeshappened yes, like one or two songs, but they were all beautifully doneand made for great reasons. All casting was beautifully done, music wasperfect and it left me feeling like a child again. I think that is what is so important. When we love something we grow upwith all we want is to relive those days and moments, to feel inspiredand hopeful. To me that is what Beauty and The Beast did for me and Iwouldn't change anything. Animated or not it still brought that magicin me once again. All I can say now is please bring more like this ontothe screen!
