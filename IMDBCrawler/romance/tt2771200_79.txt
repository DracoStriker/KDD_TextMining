Amazed!!Probably the best word I can use to describe my feeling upon watchingthe film in theaters. It truly was an excellent film. It certainly hadsome originality, even though it was a remake of the 1991 animatedclassic. The characters were well driven, and came to life, morerealized than I could have imagined.I still feel the animated version is far more superior, but this isdefinitely a close second. The acting wasn't terrible, however, EmmaWatson is the most memorable as Belle. She was great. A great step forher, from the days of Hermione in the Harry Potter series. The part ofMaurice was better than the animated film, Kevin Kline was nearlyunnoticeable, as I didn't recognize him.
