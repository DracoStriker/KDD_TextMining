Was lifeless, characters had no emotion or personality , found myselfrooting for gaston, he was the only cool one. Modern autotuned garbage.CGI was awful and way overdone. Nothing like the original. Songs werelong and annoying. Dialogue felt rushed like they tried to cram all thestuff from the original into it but ran out of time.
