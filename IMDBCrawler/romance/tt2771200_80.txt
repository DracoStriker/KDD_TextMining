As an unabashed fan of the 1991 film, I came to this version ready fora fight -- more than one! Who dares tamper with a classic? But bit bybit, and moment by moment, I was enchanted all over again: the humanperformances "fleshed out" the old animated ones; the coggier Cogsworthand more limited Lumiere charmed me afresh with their differences frommemory. The new songs, though surprising, fit remarkably well, and Inever felt that the score missed a beat. And when all was added up, thesum was far more than any of the new and varied parts: this is a freshmasterpiece, beginning as a riff but ending with something much muchmore than a "cover" -- if Disney can do this as well with its otherplanned live-action/CGI versions, then count me in. This is abrilliantly-crafted film that honors and yet moves beyond its belovedoriginal.
