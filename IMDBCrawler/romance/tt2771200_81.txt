The remake of "Beauty and the Beast" is Disney's latest in live actionanimation. Blending real actors with CGI, it's a story most of us know(and love) about Belle and the Beast. Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) plays Belle, a simple country girlwho is looking for her Prince Charming. She lives an ordinary life inan ordinary town surrounded by ordinary people. Trouble is, they thinkSHE'S strange. Gaston, the local hunk, has decided he must make Bellehis wife since she clearly isn't interested in him. Fate, however, hasother plans for both of them.Although the film was very pretty to look at, it lacked depth andsimply did not have the heart the animated version had. I love EmmaWatson, but her singing voice was adequate at best. Kevin Kline (whoportrayed Belle's father) looked like he would rather be anywhere butwhere he was. It was Luke Evans (as Gaston) that stole the show. He stayed true tothe character of Gaston, and man could he belt out a tune! Anotherproblem I had is Disney trying to introduce a sexually confusedcharacter, LeFou. I wish someone would try to explain to me why thiswas done because, quite frankly, I am sick and tired of people tryingto rewrite fairy tales just to make them "politically correct." Rated PG and even with its flaws, I would still recommend it.
