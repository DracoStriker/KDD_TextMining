Very much like the cartoon! The singing was really good ... Emma Watson... what a star! The acting was great. I was in two minds about seeingthis as it's my favorite fairy story and my favorite Disney cartoon. Iwas in tears at the end, even though I knew the story backwards. Whydidn't I give it 10 ... The thing that let it down a little for me wasthe make up of The Beast, I thought it was a little too scary for thefilm and the wolves were quite a bit nastier than the cartoon version.Young children may be scared by these things.
