An almost perfect adaptation with many subtle changes that many peoplewill probably miss. What I dislike is the obvious "gayness" of LeFou. Amagnificent marriage of live action, animation, and CGI. "Agathe" isthe "enchantress" who changes the Prince into the Beast, and yet thisis never quite obvious to the townspeople. Additional songs andreworked lyrics, plus a more complete "background story" about Belle'sand the Prince's parents. Only one or two scary spots and a ratherpleasing interpretation of the Beast in "human" form. Belle's father isportrayed as a very clever man and not as an absent-minded buffoon.Gaston shoots The Beast several times and it's "almost bloodless"Hollywood violence. In 1991, he stabbed the Beast to death. Gaston diesas he traditionally should; never by the hand of the Disney hero orheroine. When a film or stage-play is "reborn" it's impossible toplease everyone, but this one tries very hard to do so. Amazingcinematography, costumes and art direction. An outstanding cast andvery well performed. I thought Emma Watson was just fine. I want thatWhite Stallion with his built-in "GPS"! I miss the (extra) song "HumanAgain" and it should have been there! Enjoyable and entertaining endingtitles. A great marketing idea would be the packaging of the 1991animation and this 2017 version as a double Blu-Ray? For almosteveryone except extremely small children. Curiously reviewed, as peopleeither totally loved it or hated it!
