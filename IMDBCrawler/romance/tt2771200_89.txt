Excellent movie/live-action remake to an animated classic. Saw it twicein the theater and just bought the BluRay/DVD/Digital HD movie combopack this week. Great performances by the entire cast, especially byEmma Watson as Belle, Luke Evans as Gaston, and Ewan McGregor as asLumeire.Emma Watson gave an overall fine performance as Belle, her singing wasprobably the "weakest" part of her portrayal. She has a pleasantsinging voice, just not the vocal range compared to the other characterroles and cast members in movie. The opening number when she wasintroduced as Belle sounded nice, but was a bit over-produced and"auto- tuned". To be fair, all the cast members singing vocals in themovie were likely "auto- tuned" and processed to varying extents. Thatis the nature of a movie and sound studio production, especially in amusical driven version. So to focus critiques only on Emma Watson'svocals as being "auto-tuned" in the opening scene introducing Belle'scharacter seems objectively unfair. Her later singing moments as Bellein the movie got noticeably better and sounded more natural as the filmwent along. Her best singing scene was her last section, during thesomber "How Does A Moment Last Forever" portion when the Beast/Princebrings Belle to Paris, France using his enchanted magical book to thesmall château where Belle's mother passed away from the plague when shewas a baby. She exuded an emotional and natural singing voice tocapture and portray that sad somber moment very well during that sceneof the movie. Emma Watson's sincere acting, charming persona, radiantappearance, and admirable vocals for a 1st time singer in a moviemusical combined to superbly embrace and embody her role as Belle withgraceful style.Overall, fabulous and enchanting performances by the ensemble cast.Great work on the production, direction, and CGI special effects byeveryone involved in the movie. Well done!
