I first saw the live-action adaption of Beauty and the Beast on openingnight at a cinema-capri at one of the Harkins Theaters near me.And whenI first saw the first seen with the prince becoming the Beast andseeing Belle sing for the first song of the movie,I instantly feltamazed by the movie.And this is one of the only live action remakes ofa movie that is a very beautiful movie.And I love how the movie has asong for the beast and how it reminds me of let it go of how it showshow the beast feels about belle leaving but knows that she will alwaysstay with him in his heart.And also the scene where the beast dies fromhis injury and all of the castle staff turn into lifeless objects,Ifelt tears coming from my eyes by how much the characters mean toome.But the part when the enchantress saw how much Belle loves the Beastand it was already too late,she used her magic turn the beast andeverybody else back into humans and how the prince/beast and belle arereunited and share true love's kiss and the castle goes back tonormal,the scene was so beautiful and amazing.It's my favorite movie ofthe year and it's a great adaption of one of my favorite Disneyanimated movies of all time.10/10
