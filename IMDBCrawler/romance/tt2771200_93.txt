Excellent live action remake to an animated Disney classic! Bought themovie on BluRay recently after seeing it in the theater a couple monthsago. Pitch perfect casting of all the characters overall. Especiallyliked the performances of Emma Watson as Belle, Ewan McGregor asLumiere, and Luke Evans as Gaston. Each performance brought theiranimated counterpart characters to life as well as could be imagined.Each member of the ensemble cast brought some realness and distinctpersonality to their characters in this live-action version. From the charm, fearlessness, independence, and radiance that EmmaWatson portrayed and embodied into Belle. To the enthusiasm, joy, andpure fun that Ewan McGregor embraced with Lumiere. From the brashnessand over- the-top entertaining and villainous persona that Luke Evansbrought to Gaston. The casting, acting performances, along with the CGIspecial effects, and the excellent directing together combined to makethis movie a magnificent success. FYI, to the earlier review poster, Belle (Emma Watson) does cry withsomber sorrow and sadness in the ending scene when she thinks theBeast/Prince passes away. Before she declares her love for him to allowthe Prince and the other castle characters to transform back to normalhuman form. Those are CLEARLY real tears coming out of her eyes, soEmma Watson portrayed and expressed the heartbreaking emotions of thatclimatic ending scene VERY WELL.In the end, this live action version "Beauty & The Beast" will finishas one of the Top 10 grossing movies all-time revenue grosses earned atthe box office. Both domestically and internationally worldwideoverall. So based on those box office results, a vast majority peoplewho saw this movie enjoyed, were entertained, and pleased with whatthey saw in the theaters. Highly recommend purchasing this movie in anyformat (BluRay, DV, Digital HD). A memorable live action remake andfamily movie for all generations.
