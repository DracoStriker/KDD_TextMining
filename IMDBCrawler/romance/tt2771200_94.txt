100% agree with Joshua Cimarric-Penczek. A super production wasted.Emma Watson's performance was very poor, failed to capture the audiencebecause she did not look naive, lovely and beautiful. She looks like arobot in the movie. She did not generate emotions, even taking the mostimportant role of that beautiful novel. The film was rescued for theexcellent performance of Luke Evans (Gaston) and Josh Gad (LeFou). Therest of the cast only served as fill in the plot.
