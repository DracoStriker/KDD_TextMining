After reading so many 1/10, I feel compelled to write a review. It'snot the greatest ever film but it's a good one, much better than manyof the CGI films out there. This is a fantastic update to a classic.The great actors (Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, and Ian McKellen) lendtheir voices to the inanimate objects and as a result, they are verymoving; I teared. Luke Evans is a bad guy who is really good to hate.Even the Belle here has agency and strength to stand up to brutes.She's a good role model to little girls who watch the show.
