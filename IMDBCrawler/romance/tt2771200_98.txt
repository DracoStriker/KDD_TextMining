First and foremost, this is a movie for children. The original was amovie for children. I'm surprised at so many scathing and very negativereviews I've read here.The sets and costumes are beautiful. The music is classic and treatedwith respect. It takes a very classic Disney animated film and fleshesit out with additional character development and enhanced songs. Manylittle Disney princesses will watch it over and over again, just likethe original animated version.No movie is perfect, but I found it charming and produced with a greatdeal of love.
