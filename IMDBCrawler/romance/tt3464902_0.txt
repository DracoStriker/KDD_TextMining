The Lobster is a surreal deadpan comedy about the strangeness of socialpressures and modern relationships. The setting is a bleak, tightly controlled hotel on the coast ofIreland. David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Architect, is given40 days to find a partner or else be transformed into an animal of hischoosing; in this case, a lobster. Sound strange? That's just the first10 minutes. Guests of the hotel are subjected to routine trips to shoot'loners' with tranquillisers, and awkward high-school dances to enticesingles to mingle. As David's days start running out, he decides tofeign common interest with a heartless woman in order to escape hisfate. But can he pull it off? Farrell really hits the mark with this role, displaying awkwardmachismo and fragile humility in equal measure. His comedic timing ismatched only by his supporting cast that includes John C. Reilly,Ashley Jensen, and Olivia Coleman. Rachel Weisz is also spot-on as theshort-sighted woman.The Lobster has just about everything you'd want from a film. It'sunpredictable, it's offbeat, and it's laugh-out-loud funny. But it'smost impressive feature is the subtext - it manages to reflect how oddour own modern-day social pressures are. How loneliness is feared, howindividuality loses out to the mainstream system, and how relationshipshave to be deemed 'legitimate' by some higher order. There's plenty totalk about with this film, and I'll definitely be seeing it again todelve a little deeper....
