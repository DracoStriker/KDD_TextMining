There's no chance that you'll see a film as weird as The Lobster thiswhole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get acompletely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more andmore absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incrediblyunique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing andsurprisingly entertaining to watch.The story centres around one man, played by Colin Farrell, as heattempts to find a partner as a part of this bizarre system. The firstact revolves around his time in 'The Hotel', and is not only hugelyodd, but both dramatic and unnerving as well as hilarious to watch,featuring some of the best dark comedy written in years.The film takes its story as seriously as any drama, and you feel thatthrough the deeply disturbing atmosphere that emerges off the screen.However, as the film is just so weird, it eases you into the oddness ofit all very impressively through the use of humour, something that morepretentious art-house films fail to do, and are resultantly a lotharder to really get into.So, you'll definitely be laughing a lot, if not in a more disturbedthan hugely entertained manner, throughout the first act, and by theend of it, you'll surely be as used as you can be to the incrediblyweird feel of this whole film.Just to give you an idea of how unorthodox this film is, every scene isfull of awkward silences, the actors speak as if they're reading off ofcue cards with no emotion whatsoever, the imagery is very ugly andunpleasant to look at right the way through, and the incredible slowpace of it all means that the film feels like it goes on for about fivetimes as long as it actually does.And yet, I still can't get around the fact that this is a brilliantfilm. Mainly, it's the fact that it's just so unique and almostshockingly bizarre, but it's just filled with so many captivating ideasthat it's impossible not to be fully drawn into this insane story.So, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty mucheverything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents thisfrom being a truly incredible film. Following the end of the first act,the film does lose its way quite a lot, taking almost too big a leapinto an even stranger abyss than you ever imagined at the beginning,and, with a little less humour in the latter stages, isn't as easy towatch as the first act had been.However, it does pick up again towards a terrifying and as bizarre asever conclusion, and that's why I'm going to give The Lobster a 9 outof 10, but I must warn you that if you feel you can't cope with thisfilm for longer than the first twenty minutes, then it's not for you.This is definitely a cult film for the ages, but won't be a big hitwith general audiences.
