The film's concept: all adults who have recently lost a partner throughdeath or divorce are sent to a hotel, where if they do not fall in lovewithin 45 days, they are surgically transformed into an animal of theirchoosing. ''A lobster's a great choice''.I try not to explain the film's plot when somebody asks, so as not tocompletely dissuade them from viewing. Maybe this ridiculous concept isin reference to how ridiculous forcing someone to fall in love due tocommon interests is, or even just forcing someone to eventually getmarried, a practice common in the modern world. A comment on thesocietal pressures put on single adults. There are constant referencesand reminders to how even numbers are perfect, a couple. There is afurther commentary on applying limiting labels and boxes to people,bisexual not being an option on the sexuality question, no half-sizedshoes.Collin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the many minor characters,all add to the film greatly. There are no weak actors which I couldpoint out. The screen writing can be fast and witty at times, but Ifelt the ''quirkiness'' was definitely overdone. The robotic andmonotonous speech pattern was generally funny but also overdone.I have spoken to many people who do not enjoy this film, and I candefinitely respect and understand their opinion. The Lobster is not foreveryone, with it's strange plot, writing and imagery. It's script issimilar to that of a Wes Anderson film, but still remains very dark,and at times, disturbing. It is without a doubt, a slow film, heavilyreliant on dialogue (which many people won't even find funny).I would recommend the film to people who enjoy quirky films such asFrank, Juno or The Grand Budapest Hotel, although The Lobster isdefinitely darker than those examples.Probably one of the strangest film I've ever watched.
