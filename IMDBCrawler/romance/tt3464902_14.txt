I am one of the minority here who disliked the movie. Saw it yesterdayand I am still horrified whenever I remember it. Yes, the performanceswere great and it was refreshing to see well known stars playingcharacters that are against their usual type. But I don't understandwhy the cruelty was necessary and what message could bring the audiencethe violence against animals. Although this film is presented asromantic, I didn't find any emotions apart from indifference and hatredin the characters, or actually in the whole world and story. All in allit's boring, too long, one does not understand why the people in thestory act the way they do or how does the world where coupling isobligatory work. It's one of the movies I won't never EVER want to seeagain.
