A kitchen sink of arbitrary ideas. The director is just throwing crapagainst the wall and seeing what sticks. The story is based on a feebleand unconvincing premise. Anyone who fails to stay in committedrelationships is turned into an animal. What?? When did the societycare so much for everyone to be with a partner? The motivations ofindividual characters are just as uncompelling as the obstacles theyare "forced" to overcome. Depictions of cruelty come from a desperatedesire to move the story that is dead in the water and does notself-propel. I watched quite a bit of self-centered, pseudo-profoundEuropean movies in my youth; I never thought something like that wouldfly here. Miraculously it does. If this is a trend, we are in for someugly, sad cinematic dystopia.
