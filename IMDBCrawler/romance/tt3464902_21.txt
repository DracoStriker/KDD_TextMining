Ordinarily, I enjoy the unusual movie, not tailored to the generalpublic, and have viewed many, many such films over the years. So, whenI read about "The Lobster" and thought it was worth viewing, invitingsome friends to come along. They couldn't make it, and I'm so glad theydidn't come; I would never be able to recommend another movie. "The Lobster" begins with an interesting premise but runs out of gas,and the viewer's interest, about half way through. It begins in astrange world which is fine but ceases to be entertaining, interesting,or worthwhile fairly quickly. The director seems to lose his way oncethe scene shifts to the wood locale. The film goes from mildly offbeatto what? finally ending with "are you kidding me?" When the movie endedthe entire audience just sat there silent without moving. This is amovie I hope to forget as soon as possible I only hope that no one asksme about it so I won't have to admit I saw it. I'm sure the director,script writer, etc., have a message hidden in there but the overalleffect is that of eating a bad meal; you hope to get it out of yoursystem as quickly as possible.
