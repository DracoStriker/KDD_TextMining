If I could give this movie less than a 1, then I would. A boring filmthat's incredibly hard to sit through, as it tries to be artsy toportray a lousy plot. Poor filming, editing, plot, and the efforts athumor were lost. I listened to the lady next to me say, "when will thisend?" And then it abruptly ended, after 2 hours of agony. I don't recommend this movie to anyone and it is beyond me as to how itwon any awards. I went to see it with my brother and father and as wegot out of the movie all we could do was laugh at the atrocity we justwatched together. The one plus is that there is now no gray arearegarding the worst movie I have ever seen; quite simply, it is "TheLobster." Collin Farrell is lucky that his career is established, andhe is a draw, but his name will never sucker me into another movie.(Think Eddie Murphy in "Tank," or virtually any of the recent AdamSandler movies.) I had to research online what message the director was even trying toget across, as it was lost in this mess of a movie. Two thumbs down. Iwish I could've given it a 0 out of 10.
