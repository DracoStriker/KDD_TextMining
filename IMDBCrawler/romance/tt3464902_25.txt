The Lobster is a load of pretentious BS, to put it simply. It's coremessage is an incredibly simple one, and one that the director seems tothink is much more profound than it actually is. As an allegory, it'sincredibly confusing - both sides are clearly meant to be villainous,but in terms of what they represent, it's black-and-white - being in arelationship or not. The audience becomes so confused that they juststop listening to what it represents, and As a story, it just doesn'twork. Nobody has even a slight reason for doing anything. Society'sreason for the relationship thing is never explained. The lady killsthe dog for no reason. The singles are pointlessly mean and petty, andthe protagonist is stupid for even trying to be with them. It's aflimsy narrative that falls apart under the slightest observation.The film tried to advertise itself as a comedy, but if it weren't forthe marketing, i would never had realised. It just wasn't funny. Noteven slightly. Any jokes there were were either so poorly executed thatthey didn't even seem like jokes, or just not funny in concept. There'salso a load of gore that has no reason for being there. I was coveringmy eyes for half of the 3rd act of the film expecting somethinghorrible to happen (and it did often).To put it simply, The Lobster is the worst kind of bad film: a bad filmthinks it's way better than it actually is. it thinks it's funny whenit isn't, it thinks it's deep when it isn't, and critics seem to thinkthat it's good when it isn't. Don't watch this film.
