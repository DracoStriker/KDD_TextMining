First of all the word comedy has no place in its description: comedy: Afilm, play, or broadcast program intended to make an audience laugh(Oxford dictionary). It is a shame to see few great names into thismovie: Incoherent, Indecent and Insane. A brilliant mind is theopposite of this movie. During this movie I was several times temptedto run away and let the finish of this movie for these that reallyregret any penny spent onto this movie. As long as this review shallhave minimum of 10 lines of text, I will add another think: do notbring kids to this movie if you worked hard until now to themeducation.
