'The Lobster' proposes an absurd premise - that a society exists wherepeople who fail to maintain a relationship with their spouse are sentto re-education camps. This rehab for singles takes the form of aregimented bourgeois hotel where the guests must find a replacementpartner within 45 days. If they succeed, they are permitted to returnto a dreary urban existence with their new significant other. If theyfail to hook up with another person, the hapless losers are exiled tothe surrounding forest where they are hunted down with tranquilizerguns, prior to being surgically transformed into an animal. This fatuous fable is delivered with the vitality of a robot'sdaydream. The expressionless acting style and wooden script producesonly profound tedium, punctuated by some random episodes of theatricalsilliness and unpleasant cruelty. It's hard to see the point of thispretentious allegory - it could be a critique of society'sregimentation or a caricature of transmigration, but then again, itmight not. Spending even one minute considering whether this dull farcepossesses any meaning is excessively generous.
