Dark, depressing, bad script, bad acing, weird, not funny at all. Don'twaste your money on this POS. We walked out and got our money bad.That's how bad it was. I wish I could give it a zero. Today was mybirthday and my girlfriend wanted me to pick out a movie to watch. Wewent thinking this would be a funny romantic comedy but it was nothingof the sort. Too bad. maybe if they did it differently it could havebeen. But oh well. I never walk out of movies even if they're bad Istay till the end but my girlfriend didn't want to sit through it. Wegave it a chance. We probably stayed about 25 min. I don't get why itgot such good reviews. just my opinion though so it's up to you.
