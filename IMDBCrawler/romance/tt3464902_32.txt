I fell asleep during this movie probably 20 times. It started out OK,if not a little weird and I don't mind that.Then it came to the scenes after the initial ones 30 minutes in whereindull dialogues were exchanged in deadpan.I know the reviewers think they're smart for rating this movie highlyout of a sense of moral obligation to shine a light on our society andit's hypocrisy/absurdity about relationships.What I don't understand is why it needed to be so thoroughlyunpleasant, boring, anticlimactic & predictable.It simply wasn't a good movie. It aroused little deeper thought andevoked almost no emotion. You knew what was coming a mile away at alltimes.I would highly recommend to anyone that they avoid this thoroughlyunoriginal and self-indulgent dumpster fire of a movie.
