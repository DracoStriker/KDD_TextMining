This was a total waste of 2 hours of my life that I'll NEVER get back.You will be better off watching someone sit on a chair motionless for 2hours. I cannot stress how incredibly stupid this movie is. I kepthoping that it'll get better, but instead it got progressively worsewith each scene. The theme of animal ceuelty is vile. A woman kicks adog to death and takes pleasure from it, rabbits are skinned alive,donkeys shot...only a psychopath could think of this and enjoy it. I doNOT understand those who gave this train-wreck a high rating. They mustbe thinking "if I give a high rating to a non-conventional movie, I'mcool." No, you're just stupid with odious taste. My dog's poop is moreappealing to me to watch than this movie. Just like the protagonist,you'll want to gauge your eyes out by the end of it. I'm just gonna sitback now and wait for the Apocalypse. The human race is doomed.
