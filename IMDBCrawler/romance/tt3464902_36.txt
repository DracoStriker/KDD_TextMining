I think this is my first review on IMDb, I've posted reviews on othersites and I normally give a synopsis for a review, but not this time. Iwon't even bother going into details, but I thought this movie wastrying too hard to be "sublime" and it's just awful. A shame to put abrilliant cast through this disturbing and ridiculousplot/theme/nightmare of a movie. Only the fourth movie I've ever walkedout of in my life and I only wish I'd walked out sooner than what Idid. Started out interesting, albeit strange, but became too long,boring and as soon as I realized I didn't give two ___ about how itended, we left. The only thing worse than having seen it is knowing Ican't unsee it.
