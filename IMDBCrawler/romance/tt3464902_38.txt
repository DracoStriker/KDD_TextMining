Not going to write a lot here, as not much to say other than containsBoring robotic acting, flat zero-dimensional totally non-plausiblecharacters which one can't care anything about, ridiculous boringpointless dialog, sexual scenes and language in gross and offensiveway, pointless animal cruelty, disjointed ridiculous plodding overlylong stupid plot.I've seen really boring movies, offensive movies, maddeningly stupidmovies, really badly acted movies, movies with annoying, boring andvile characters. But I must admit this movie is a grand achievement inthat it manages to combine all these characteristics into one trulystinky boring mess.IT would have wasted 2 hours of my life, had I not walked out. My votewas actually zero stars but scale only goes down to one. The criticswho gave this 91% must be all in on black-comedy joke to see if theycan sucker people into going along.
