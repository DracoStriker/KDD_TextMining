The writer clearly has some issue to work through and sadly was allowedthe resources to share this with an audience. If this is considered tobe innovative cinema then the bar has been lowered to sub basementlevels. This movie is not funny (as advertised), not clever, and notworth seeing. The acting was actually not dreadful given what the casthad to work with. I envision the author sitting at his desk trying toarrive at the most ridiculous premise possible, then constructing ascript around it. Yes I get that this is an attempt to paint adystopian view of societal relationships and expectations viaexaggeration and juxtaposition. But why does the vehicle feel like aRoad Runner cartoon with 20 ton Acme weights being dropped on theaudience on a regular basis? If you want quality bizarre spend yourcash on a Goddard movie.
