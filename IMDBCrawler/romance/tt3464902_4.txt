I am obviously going against the trend here, so be it. I found themovie pretentious, ill balanced and with none of the nuances other moreaccomplished directors manage to reveal with their use of absurdism andcounterpoint.First, if the movie had been short, maybe it would have been bearable,maybe, as it stands, its length goes to show, at least for me, thatthere was not a compass that guided the director, this was a rudderlessattempt at social commentary. I don't care if Mr Lanthimos isconsidered the plus ultra of directors, this is bad.The movie tries to match absurdism with social commentary, but fails tocreate a world in which A) the absurd seems plausible and B) theplausible seems absurd. The deadpan, flat delivery of the lines losesall power after the first 30 minutes of the 1h 58m this thing goes onfor and the humour, again, always spurred on by the absurdity of themoment/comment/observation, fails to find me (as it failed to find thefunny bone of most people in a packed, large movie theatre in London,in fact, first movie I've gone to see in ages where people began toleave the cinema half-way, which I longingly followed with my eyeswishing it was me).The cinematography is fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but Lanthimosfails to use it to punctuate the absurd moments (something Wes Andersondoes very well, as does Paolo Sorrentino) nor is the dramatism enhancedby precise camera work (Hitchcock, Fellini, Truffaut). The dialogue,even in its supposed absurdist nature, is poor, fails to weave acrossand is uneven. While the leads do a super job, the characters are flatand I don't care for them or what happens to them, which is always abad sign for me.There are moments when this thing is good, like the hotel managerssinging a duet, but they do not translate across the whole story,mainly because very quickly we leave the only part where there areinteresting characters and spend the rest of the movie in the forest. I found the movie:-Too long -Pretentious without the grace to be so -flat -Uninspiring-did I say too long? -A convoluted way to tell a story that could havebeen told with the same intent in less time, with more observant,astute dialogue and far better crafted cinematography -A depressingexperience -Not funny, by milesHaving just seen for the first time 'The Great Beauty' followed by 'TheRoyal Tenenbaums' I realized now what The 'Lobster' could have been butdid not have the artistic currency to do. The social commentary isthere, no doubt, I just did not like how it was executed.Maybe I am just a heathen with no taste...but of course, these are myimpressions, I know others who truly loved it, and that is good too.
