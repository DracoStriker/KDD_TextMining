The film had nice direction with all the long shots and weird cameraangles that tell you straight away , hey this is an art film. I thinkthe point of the film is to make you think and i did but.... the nearly2 hours of metaphor bore snore had me thinking "oh no , I've done itagain and wasted precious minutes on an unrewarding experiment.Lots of times in the film i found myself saying "no way ,that wouldn'thappen" , and of course the producer writer would say , "well thats thepoint of the movie" , it's metaphorical"...... ah! so thats how to getaway with making a movie this bad.Its been labelled a comedy, romance, sci fi! There was no real scienceor comedy, i laughed once.I drew my own conclusions to the meanings of the title but i wont boreyou with the details as it's simply not worth the time.In a few words.... Human conditioning , how we do things to fit in withother people, how we do thing people ask without question and thestruggles we go through to find love. Don't waste time on this , Don't be fooled by the genre's, itsabsolutely misleading , the genre should be modern fart.1 star for film work , a waste of good actors and money!
