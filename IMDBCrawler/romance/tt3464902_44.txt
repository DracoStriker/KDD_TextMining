This has got to be hands down the worst piece or rubbish I have everseen.It was cringe worthy how they tried to make it arty but it turnedout to be pretentious tripe. Anyone giving it good reviews are justtrying to look intelligent as if to say 'Oh yeah I get it' When therereally is nothing to get. It was just awful strung together, boringcrud.I don't know how they managed to get such good names to sign up tothis movie, really that is all it has going for it. I think without thenames this movie would not have been seen by anyone. Do yourself afavour and give this one a big miss. By the way I do like indie moviesand i do like art house movies, I am not some philistine who doesn'tappreciate good art and fringe cinema, but this was truly bad.
