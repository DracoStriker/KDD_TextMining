This movie was advertised as a quirky romantic comedy. It beginspromisingly with a moody background and otherworldly atmosphere beingset. Then halfway through the movie, it goes from dark to sick. We aresubject to a scene where a sociopath brags to her lover that she hasjust kicked his innocent, sweet dog to death. Just what we all want tosee when we take a date to a movie. The camera shows her bloody shoes.The director has already established the killer as a psycho. Butthen,in a move that could only be called animal torture porn, thecamera shows the dog lying in a pool of blood. Totally gratuitous, vileand disgusting. I walked out and demanded a refund, and I am not easilyoffended.Don't see this crap unless you like to vomit on yourself.
