Weird, whacky & wicked but equally dull, sterile & vapid, The Lobsteris a strange beast that actually begins quite well but tumbles down theroad after the halfway mark to conclude on a rather uninteresting note.The concept is no doubt intriguing and it takes its time to make usfamiliar to the society inhabiting its tale but all of it doesn'tamount to much in the end & it fails to leave any lasting impression.Set in a dystopian future, The Lobster presents a world in which singlepeople are arrested & taken to a hotel where they are obliged to find amatching partner within 45 days or they are transformed into animals &released into the woods. The plot follows David who arrives at thehotel for the same reason but his endeavours of finding a mate beforehis time is over ends far more tragically than he expected.Co-written & directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, The Lobster marks hisEnglish-language debut and the idea & inspiration behind it is bothclever & admirable. The sequences taking place in the hotel are nicelycarried out but its second half lacks the same level of creativitythat's present in the first half. The excitement goes missing once theprotagonist leaves the hotel and from there on, it just limpsthroughout its remaining runtime.The hotel is neatly maintained but it also has a creepy vibe about it.Camera movements are fluid, colour hues wonderfully compliment itsovercast ambiance and lighting seems natural for the most part. Editingallows the plot to unfold at an unhurried pace but the whole storyfeels twice as long because of that, with no idea of where it's headed.Last, the background score is just as odd as the story's content and isintermittently utilised.Coming to the performances, The Lobster features a fine cast in ColinFarrell, Rachel Weisz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw & John C. Reilly andmost of them are simply bland & lifeless in their respective roles. Itcan be argued that the spiritless rendition of these scripted peoplewas deliberate but it doesn't really help in enriching the experience,at all. The deadpan wit is occasionally amusing but it's also too easyto get frustrated by whatever is happening.On an overall scale, The Lobster is an uncanny mix of bizarre ideasthat, in its effort to play with multiple things at once, may end updrifting many of its viewers. While I found nothing lovable about it,its parody of the society that gives way too much credit tocompanionship, in addition to the dig it takes at those match-makingalgorithms which rely on similar traits & likeness factor is one aspectI liked but in all seriousness, The Lobster is too mediocre to be ofany significance.
