Lobster was painful to watch and its length made the experienceexcruciating. Most of the characters were not likable and it wasdifficult to care about them. I imagine the director wanted to create adeeper meaning, but he failed to create any meaning at all. Even as asatire of modern relationships and the pressure people experience to bea part of them, I found it failed to deliver. The film was humorlessand pretentious. The theater was nearly empty and no one laughed at anypoint in the film. I failed to see the point and also I failed to seewhy characters in the film did as they were told. I saw no basis forthe creation of the rules of this society and the rebel group ofsingles in the woods seemed even worse than the couple police in thehotel.
