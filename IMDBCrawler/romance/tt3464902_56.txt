The movie begins quite intelligibly, though any intelligent viewer willsoon begin to wonder how the basic directive is to be enforced withoutsubstantial armed force. As the film moves out of the hotel into theworld outside, however, it becomes ever more confused and confusing.The director seems to be making a fundamentally misanthropic statement:human relationships of love are either not possible or not permitted.I'm by no means sure that this is the director's intention or concept,however. The film reminds me of more than one opera I have seen onGerman stages, where the director dresses up an obscure concept withall kinds of strange touches whose purpose seems to be to mystify theaudience. Some of the performances in this film are good, but as awhole "The Lobster" wastes those performances in the service of aseriously confused premise.
