For the 7.30 screening, the 79-seat auditorium was at least threequarters full, and the majority of people were laughing and enjoyingit- I must have watched a different film, because I found this to beunwatchable, an absolutely irredeeming film, devoid of anything worthcaring about.Story of a man, at an undisclosed time in the future, being confined toa mysterious hotel for 45 days, during which time, he systematicallymust find a mate, or be turned into an animal of his choice seemed oddto me, but positive reviews piqued my interest, and I gave it a go, butwhen the film begins with a woman shooting a cow in the head, I quicklyregretted my decision. Everything, all of the characters and their dialogue, every situationthey're in, every frame of this movie is so dry and muted that it alljust comes across as flat and boring, except for the animal cruelty. Ijust didn't care about any of the characters or the situation they werein, I tuned out so much by about 45 minutes in. Then, ...kicking a dog to death and showing its bloodied body and trying to passthat off as some type of biting satirical wit was vile. Repulsive. Repugnant. As a dog lover, I was nauseated and angry. I left the cinema. I walkedout. I didn't care about anything in the film, none of the charactersinterested me, I could not, and still can't, think of a redeemingquality or value. A Good Day To Die Hard was previously the only film Ihad walked out of in a cinema. Now I can say that about two films.
