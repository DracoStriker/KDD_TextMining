De only thing i really enjoyed is the way this movie was shot.Greatcamera work.And the locations are beautiful.The rest of it is verymeager.The story leads to nothing,You are watching this and then whenit's trough you keep on wondering 'what was it about'? it's veryunsatisfying. The story is bizar and when it starts you are kind ofdrawn into it but halfway trough you start to worry where it's going tolead you to.I't was'nt worth my time. it drags on and on. i'm surprisedhow this film keeps popping up in the best of 2015 lists. It isextremely boring i.m.o. I can enjoy clue-less movies but The Lobsterhad to little to keep me interested. Acting might be good , but thestory is it's weakest point i guess.Had kind of a 'hangover'when it wasdone.
