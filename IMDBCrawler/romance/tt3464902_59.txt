There are many reviews of this film, many of them as bizarre as thefilm itself.To give potential viewers a realistic idea this needs to be said: It isnot by any stretch of the imagination a comedy. There is not a singlescene in the film that is funny at all. Most scenes are bleak andmenacing.It is a Science Fiction HORROR movie which will have a most depressingeffect on most viewers. I truly do not understand how so many reviewerscan claim to have found any humour whatsoever in it.Sadly it did not have any interesting ideas about life and is bestavoided except by people who enjoy watching the misery of a bleakworld.
