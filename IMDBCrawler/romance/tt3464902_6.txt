This movie was in my opinion pure and simple pointless. Why make it?There is no point. It only makes you feel seek and confused on why in anear future everyone should be a couple. Even the main idea has nosense. Some say dark comedy. Comedy? No way, just a deeply disturbingon all levels and violent senseless movie. And sorry but Collin Farrellis not an actor that should be use in a movie where the character istrying to show any kind of emotion but only in movies where he can playthe pretty boy. Here he walks with the same expression on his face nomatter what happens in the scene. No real emotion from his stone face.The end of the movie was unnecessarily disturbing like the rest.He wasnot believable as the man who can make such a sacrifice for the womenhe's in love with. I couldn't feel any kind of love between the maincharacters. Sorry, but I deeply disliked this movie.
