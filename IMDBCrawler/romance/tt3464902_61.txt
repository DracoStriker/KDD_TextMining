This is the most dreadful outcome of a script. There is not an inch ofcomedy/romance/drama in this movie.Talk about story line, its utternonsense. Any scene or concept makes no sense whatsoever. I stayed tillthe end in hope of some twist or some meaningful conclusion but themovie makers wanted to end it in shutter island style. Instead ofleaving people spellbound, it leaves the watcher thinking this is thestupidest movie I ever chose to see. A few disturbing- totallyunnecessary and do not add to any charm of the movie. In short, theonly good thing about it is the good camera work, but totally worthlessto see given that absolutely nothing else is good about the movie. Donot go by its high ratings, if I could give it a -10 rating, I'd gowith it.
