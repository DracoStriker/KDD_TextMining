Made the mistake of purchasing this hideous movie as a DVD. Somehowlasted over an hour before switching it off, never to be viewed again.This is an extremely silly and unpleasant movie whereby animal andhuman cruelty are exalted; but not in a clever way but stupidly andincomprehensibly.I cannot be bothered to relate what the so called story of this pictureis, except to say here does not seem to be one. The truth is there isno humor or cleverness at all in this ridiculous film.The whole movie looks like it is made up as it goes along and thezombie people who give it high marks are as brainless as those who gavethe movie some awards and decent reviews:0/10 ( but rounded up to the lowest vote possible).
