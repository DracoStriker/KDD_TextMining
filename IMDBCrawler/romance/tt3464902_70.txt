This film is a great example of the ability of films to offer strong,polished images, but offer very little in polished storytelling. Thefilm contains many strong visuals, some pleasant and some disturbing.On the pleasant side, it offers scenes in a peaceful resort, beautifulscenery, and attractive and quirky characters. On the negative, itcontains images and implications of violent death to both people andanimals (and blood), crude depictions of sex (both normal and criminalsex) and characters that would easily qualify as psychopathic. Thedialogue uses crude language and a minimum of storytelling exposition.The overall feeling is of people who are simply emotionally retarded,except for one or two, such as a maid who finds ways to rebel againstthe oppressive society in which she works. The film is far too long forthe amount of story and message in it. It is also disjointed, so evenif it had enough storytelling, it would be hard to follow. As a view ofromantic relationships in an alternate future, it can be contrasted to"Her," which is a far superior film, much more moving, and much moresatisfying to watch. "Her" tells a story in a logical sequence thatleads to a sensible set of dramatic conclusions, and the viewer leavesthinking that it could plausibly happen in the foreseeable future.However, in "The Lobster," I left with the thought that this is tooconfused to be worth my effort to take seriously as a future. All inall, this film is not worth your time. I would give it a 1 out of 10for its content alone, but I bump it up to 2 out of 10 for itscinematography.
