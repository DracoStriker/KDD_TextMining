I went into it with high hopes from all the positive reviews, and I'dsay the first half was moderately amusing with all the quirkiness andsomewhat unusual characters and premise. However, after the noveltywore off, I was supremely bored as there is not much of a story. Itjust devolved into a montage of scenes with no real purpose and nocharacters I could identify with. The situations portrayed are about aslikely to ave occurred as the Pope break dancing in Harlem. I stayed tothe bitter end just to see how it turned out, so I give myself an A forendurance. If you're someone who likes "artsy" movies with no realstory line and enjoy random activity with nice photography, then thisfilm will be right up your alley.
