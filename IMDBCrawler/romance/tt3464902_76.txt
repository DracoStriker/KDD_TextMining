There are some things in this world that I simply don't get. I lovethings that are a bit "off" sometimes (such as Napoleon Dynamite is agreat film), but this movie was absurd. I was entertained for a bit,but that was only while I still had hope that something would redeemthis nonsense... but it never happened. Once the end credits rolled,all hope was lost. If you're one who appreciates things like, welllet's say, Jackson Pollock... I guess this film would be good for you.But it's not for me, and I'm sure MOST people would feel the same. Ihave to write ten lines, otherwise I would have quit already. This filmjust isn't worth it.
