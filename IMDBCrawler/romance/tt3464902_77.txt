Because I love Collin Farrell and I believe he is a great actor, Istarted to watch this movie. The storyline is absurd, but since I am agreat Science Fiction lover (I am even a science fiction novelist), Idon't get scared about a little bit of weirdness. But this movie is notonly weird and absurd, it's jam packed with total unnecessary shocktherapy. In my opinion that is. Reading the reviews there must beindividuals loving this movie, but I can't imagine that. Other than thegreat acting and cinematography. I would not want to meet the writer.He must be seriously deranged. The movie does not deserve 2 stars Igave because of the great acting and directing. But... Since I reallywant to warn you as a potential viewer that this movie will drag itselfhalf dead for two hours passed your valuable life and you will getnothing more from it than a bad taste in your mouth... please, spareyourself the horror. There is nothing in this movie that justifies youwasting those hours of your life.
