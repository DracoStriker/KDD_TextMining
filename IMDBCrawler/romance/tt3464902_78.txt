As a Greek myself , I'd like very much to have positive feedback forthis film. I had seen Dogtooth with great effort not to turn the thing off , onlybecause I had a sense of respect for the Director and I felt obliged toat least finish the damn film. However I did have a feeling that Lanthimos is an -above average-Director.So I gave " the lobster " a fresh try. I hoped this " weird wave "thing would be gone , and perhaps we'll get a good dystopian sci-fifrom a masterful Director. Sadly, this wasn't the case. The "weird wave" continues adamantly. There is no character development , there is no insight to thedystopian set up , there is no science fiction. There is only the weird. The acting is buried and we are presented withthe bizarre script ,the scenery and the baroque soundtrack to add some"quality spice". There is no entertainment in this film , each minute passed very slowly, and frankly , I was embarrassed on behalf of Colin Farrell and thoseother fine actors /actresses playing these "roles". Was there even a point? Does it raise Big questions on relationshipsand couples and society? Was it Political? I failed to see any of these hints in the film. It was just weird andbad. I must say that , again , I do see that Lanthimos -can be- a gooddirector. But since a director is the supreme maestro of a film , theman most responsible for the outcome , after such a film I cannot saythat he is a good director. Only that he can be , or he might be ,perhaps if he abandons his " style ". So let's hope he doesn't remainfaithful to it and his next film is free of the ugly weirdness andfocuses more on character and fun. 1/10 (the film is borderline unwatchable)
