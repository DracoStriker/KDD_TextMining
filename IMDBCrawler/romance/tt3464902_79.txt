As a confirmed movie buff I am usually fascinated and appreciative ofmost celluloid excursions. The opening scene of this movie has a scenethat sums up my thoughts about The Lobster. A woman is driving in adreary atmosphere alone on an endless road. She stops and gets outwhere there are 3 donkeys. Walks up to one of them and shoots it dead.Ifelt as frustrated as that woman on watching this meandering excuse ofa story and wished the director could have been shot to avoid thecreation of this pathetic 2 hours of time waste. Colin Farrell andRachel Weisz are wasted here. Best avoid. Movie ends suddenly. There isa time in the movie when dialogues go from English to French with nosub titles. Like i said... do avoid this.
