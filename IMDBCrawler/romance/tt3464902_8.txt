This is probably the worst movie I 've seen for years.I suppose Ishould support the film since I am Greek and Lanthimos is Greek too,but I'm afraid I 'm tired of this pretentious and meaningless cinema weare producing that gets its foreign distribution and recognition now.Ithought that Dogtooth was a terrible movie too, but I was hoping thatsomething might have changed with this one, especially as ColinFarrel-whom I like very much-was the lead actor;unfortunately, this isa dreadful movie, full of stupid dialogs, pretentious and pointless,stupid, and it asks to be taken for surreal or weird but Lanthimos isneither Bunuel nor Lynch.It even begs to be taken seriously as asymbolic comment on relations, which makes it seem even sillier. Thereare and there were great directors in Greece(Nikos Panagiotopoulos,Vasilis Vafeas and, most of all, Stavros Tornes, to name a few) butLanthimos is not one of them ;he is a fake and I was angry I had towatch this trash of a movie. I'm still angry, so I wrote this review.
