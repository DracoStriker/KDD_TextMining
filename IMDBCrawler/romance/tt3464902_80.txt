I'm not going into a long dissection like others. I understand themovie and what it means, but that does not negate the fact it'sabsolutely ghastly to watch. It's boring, crude, yet stupidly so. Ifelt as though I were slipping into a coma, so I skooted to the end,saw an absurd ending and happily shut it off. Colin Farrell reallychubbed out for this movie, but..overall I wouldn't recommend this tomy worst enemy.
