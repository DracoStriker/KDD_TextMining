I kept watching because Colin Farrell's screen presence kept myattention. I assumed that at some point, one of the characters woulddisplay some level of cognizance of the ridiculous plot in which theywere immersed. It turned out to be a waste of 2 hours.This movie is nothing more than a vapid romp through someone's dullsubconscious. I theorize it was written by someone who one day had therandom thought that if he had to be transformed into an animal, he'dlike it to be a lobster. Unfortunately, not all random thoughts deserveto be expanded into a screenplay.The characters are uninteresting - robotic and ultimately boring withno relatable human qualities. In Orwell's 1984 dystopia, at least weunderstand why the outer party members are so accepting of theirsituation - fear. There appears to be no motive for the citizens of thesociety in this film to accept submission to their ludicrouscircumstance. This fact alone undermines the entire premise. Temporarysuspension of disbelief regarding the characters' basic humanity andmotivation turns into permanent suspension before the film is a quarterdone.If this film is indeed allegory, I missed the hidden meaning entirely,and I've not read any other reviews that have gone further than merelyto state, "This is allegory," or, "This film makes you think." Really?What is the subtext then? What's it making you think about? Pretentiousbabble.A very bad movie. I'm giving it two stars because I watched it all theway through, though I am perfectly willing to stop watching a movieafter 20 minutes if it's truly awful. The film-makers get credit formaking me believe they were going to deliver some substance before theend.
