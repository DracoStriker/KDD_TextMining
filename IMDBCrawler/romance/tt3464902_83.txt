Meh. The film starts with a delightfully surreal premise, and gets offto a promising start as a Strangelovesque dark comedy, or perhaps evena "Being John Malkovich" maze of mind-boggling left turns.The moments of humor, however, thin out. The plot hews to the obviouseven in its twists. The deadpan delivery becomes merely dead, and a seaof intolerably flat affect gradually crushes any empathy we might havefor the characters. Exhausted of its premise, disinterested in both thehumans who inhabit it and the humans who are watching it, and gropingfor any sort of social observation that is not already obvious andwell-trodden, the film finds it has little left to say and another 90minutes to say it.It drags itself, sallow and lifeless, to a cliffhanger conclusion thatleaves us wondering what happens next, but not really caring.
