Dull dull dull. The pretentious premise of this movie is lost in thelack of any character empathy and use of Peter Greenaway mimickingmusic soundtrack. How Is this classified as a comedy? It is not eveninteresting. Not clever. It is not even pretty to look at. Why doesthis movie exist? I do not often write reviews but as a punter, this isonly for those with a pretentious disposition who want to appear cleverand intense. In fact it adds nothing original or entertaining to thepantheon of cinema. How did the excellent cast get involved in this egotrip other than by being hoodwinked into thinking it was somethingbetter than it was. Maybe something was lost in translation. Itcertainly does not work in Anglo Saxon English. Avoid.
