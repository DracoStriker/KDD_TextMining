Set in a dystopian, fascist future, single people are sent to a hotelwhere they must find a partner in 45 days or get turned into a wildanimal of their choice. David's wife has just left him, after 11 yearsof marriage, and he is sent the hotel. His chosen animal, should he notfind a partner, is a lobster.Quite intriguing, initially. The whole idea and set up was so inane youfelt compelled to stick with it. The sheer novelty of it all sucks youin.However, almost as quickly, the cracks in the concept and plot start toappear. Why do people go along with the preposterous idea? If they areforced to find a partner, why not just find anyone and pretend to be acouple, rather than suffer this fate? While obviously the central ideais quite ridiculous, it is the way people respond to it that is trulyimplausible and sets the movie up to fail.Also, why does the opposite of this "couples are everything" regimehave to be a "being a perpetual loner is the only way to go" group.Surely there can be a middle ground? The extreme polarity of it all wasirritating. Despite these flaws, however, there was a chance this could developinto an interesting drama. I figured I was happy to overlook theseobvious faults if the movie got some momentum. Alas, no, it just getsworse and worse. From a point the plot just becomes very random and,ultimately, pointless.Only worth watching if you're curious to know what all the fuss isabout, but be prepared to be disappointed.
