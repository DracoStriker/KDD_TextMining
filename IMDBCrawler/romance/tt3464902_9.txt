No consistent theme to follow = no story at all. Btw this is my firstreview and the only reason I'm doing this is because the move wasseriously that bad! Is it motivated by animal rights activism? Do theybecome animals as a way of making us humans more caring for othernon-humans? (i.e. place a 'personal' or 'species' bias into the mix tocreate empathy) ... No ... Well, maybe for a minute ... Is it motivatedby psychopathy ... well, maybe for a few more minutes ... does make youwonder whether the writer has some serious relationship issues! ...Smiles are extremely rare ... All characters have serious issuesresulting from relationship problems it would seem - i.e. none areemotionally open in relating to one another (only emotions thatcharacters express in the whole movie are negative: jealousy, anger,insecurity ... Nothing adds up - which is not an insecure need of themodern age as opposed to the post-modern one ... but a purely healthyway to make any sense of experience at all!!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing aboutthis movie made sense for more than a short while ... Totallyunpredictable, i.e. it has NO STORY to FOLLOW but is a random scene ofstuff that never adds up and leaves you wondering whether the makerseriously thinks they can actually justify its existence on the basisof some lame postmodern perspective that warrants anything andeverything as equally cool!!! TOTAL GARBAGE!!!!!
