I don't know how this could be classified as a comedy, even a blackcomedy. In any comedy, I would expect at least to smile, not scowlthrough the whole thing.If this is supposed to be about. . . conformity, resistance toauthority, love even . . . I can think of more appealing ways to dealwith those subjects. "Captures the nature of love in the 21st century." Seriously? If that'swhat love is, don't let it anywhere near me!Like Youth, this is just another case of letting myself be influencedby critics raving about a movie, and then suffering through the entirething waiting for something redeeming to happen, if only in my ownmind, only to be disappointed in the end. In this case, sorelydisappointed.Why I occasionally waste two hours at a time on drivel like thisescapes me.
