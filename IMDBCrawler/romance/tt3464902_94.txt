If this is art, or an attempt at off-beat black humour, then it fallsso very, very short of the mark. I love interesting and quirky movies, but this just isn't one of them.It sounded on paper like something that would catch the imagination,have some interesting and thought provoking subject matter and has agreat cast which drew me in, but the slow, turgid and pointless storywas too much to bear. And those reviewers who say that this movie is humorous, well anyonewho found this funny needs to check themselves into a clinic.Don't waste your life on this one.
