Good writing has engaging characters in an interesting story infusedwith metaphor, irony, moral ambiguity, and other nuances, wrappedaround a pertinent issue. This movie has none of that. It is ahaphazard mess of unrelated metaphors and irony, badly scripted, with ameandering plot. If it's intended to be a parody of bad avant-gardeEurotrash cinema, it took two hours to accomplish what could have beendone in one. The only laughs were at a flamingo and camel wanderingaround in the background. The depictions of horrid cruelty to animalswere disturbing. It dragged on so long I wish it had been my own eyes(and ears) that had been gouged out. By the end of the movie I didn'tgive a flip about any of the characters, nor how it ended, only hopingthat it would mercifully end as soon as possible. We continued watchinghoping that something interesting would happen at some point, that itwould actually go somewhere or come to some sensible conclusion. Weonly threw good time after bad. But hindsight is 20/20. Do yourself afavor; skip this movie, and spend two hours doing something moreenjoyable, like chewing on tin foil.
