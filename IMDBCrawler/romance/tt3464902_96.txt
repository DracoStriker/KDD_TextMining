Up until now I've thought Sideways was the most pointless movieever.....not any more. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! And thefact that's its 2 hours long makes it worse. The idea of the movie(taken in a Woddy Allen type direction)would have made for a goodmovie...the trailer even suggests as much. Its quirky but in a badway...no substance and throws in shocking scenes to try to throw youoff the scent of a chaotic story line. I stayed with it to the end(don't bother)in hopes of a payoff of a good story in the end. Itpitifully sputters out. The movie has one of those endings that ismindless, making you think us missed some great thesis on socialmorays....you didn't!.....90% critics on rotten tomatos? REALLY?.....let them think they know more than us....it stunk and they areafraid to say it.......avoid at all cost....!
