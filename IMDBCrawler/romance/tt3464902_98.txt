The first 30 minutes of the movie is interesting -- with strange scenesintroducing the hotel where you MUST meet your soul mate or be turnedinto an animal. However: later in the movie there are scenes ofterrible cruelty.I came out of this movie feeling depressed and manipulated and I feelvery strongly that there may be CIA involvement in the production ofthis movie. The CIA has helped produce movies before (including "ZeroDark Thirty") and this movie is NOT designed to entertain. It isdesigned to desensitize the viewer toward to suffering of others(emotional and physical) and manipulate the viewer into viewingleftover, unattached, single people as worthless and not worthy of anycompassion.
