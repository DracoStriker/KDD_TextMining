This movie seems like a long montage, you never feel engaged with thecharacters or the story as it races through plot points then plodsthrough others. The effects seem dated, in that it's noticeably fake,which often draws you out of the story. Cotillard is strong, Pitt lessso. The story itself has been done and and done better. The writing isa little lazy and predictable. One strange inclusion is that it makes apoint of introducing Pitt's character's sister. She seems to serve nopoint and it feels like something is missing. As a (SouthernHemisphere) summer "blockbuster" it will probably fare well but whencompared to some of 2016's more tense and visually appealing movies,like Norturnal Animals, it falls flat.
