What is even happening?How did this movie ever manage to grow into anything past an abstractidea hastily aborted for ringing so... drab?Did any of the people involved want to be there?As the unnatural movements, wooden acting, and Benjamin Button SFX facewould suggest, was Brad Pitt even physically present while filming thisor did he have to be entirely superimposed? Did something happen,like... he had previous engagements, had to have brunch with friendsand couldn't make it, so they had to hire someone to play Pitt againsta green screen or something? In which case, did they even try for AndySerkis before they slapped those sensors onto a wholly disinterested,pregnant panda?Is Matthew Goode even reading the contracts Hollywood is throwing hisway before signing them?Is Steven Knight ashamed of his fingers for actually following hisbrain's dictation into the completion of this... authorialembarrassment?Was the editor full-on intoxicated for the duration of their task? Werethey forced to edit with nothing but a pair of blunt scissors and twobroken thumbs? Maybe the aforementioned bored, pregnant panda was askedto multitask?Did Marion Cotillard finally got around to firing her agent after this?Watching this nonsensical monstrosity completed for the first time, didZemeckis at the very least have the decency to walk out in heavy, wetprotest against this mortifyingly puzzling directorial disgrace?I have questions. And a headache. But mostly questions.I mean...What is even happening?!?
