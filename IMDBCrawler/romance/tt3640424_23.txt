A movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Brad Pitt and MarionCotillard. The movie tells us a story of agents who met on a mission tokill German Ambassador in Casablanca during World War II and fall inlove. After returning to London their relationship is tested. It wasboring and predictable movie. I couldn't see the chemistry between maincharacters. And I was feeling a lack of something in the whole movie. Iwas expecting a lot from it but I was disappointed.
