This movie is full of stylish and attractive film-making, but the storyis ridiculously unbelievable. It opens in "french Morocco" in 1942. InNovember of 1942, French Morocco was invaded and conquered by US and UKforces. The assassination of the German "Ambassador" - there were nodiplomatic relations between "Morocco" and Germany at the time - wascarried out by our movie's heroes: Max and Marianne. They escape toEngland, marry, and have a girl child named Anna. When we see the happyfamily later, Anna is at least one year old. The movie must now be in -at least- early 1944. At that time, there were no German spies inEngland, or Scotland,Wales, or Northern Ireland, either. All had beenidentified, jailed, or turned. See Masterman, 1972. Had Marianne raisedher hand, and said, "I am a German spy," she would have been welcomedinto the Allied intelligence network. Even had she not, there wouldhave been no evidence against her. Meh, movie; terrible history.
