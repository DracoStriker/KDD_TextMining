(Spoilers). What does a man do when he finds out he's accidentallymarried to a Nazi spy? They don't want you to know that's what themovie is about. Hmmmm! Why not? ALLIED is an expensive but startlinglyboring World War II drama, but money alone can't bring a film to light.Good thing this lost $45 million of the $80 million production cost. Itmight teach them something.
