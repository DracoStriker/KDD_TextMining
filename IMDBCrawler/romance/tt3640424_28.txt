I vaguely remember a joke, where John Wayne with his tough, iconiccowboy voice, reads some lines of Shakespeare "to be or not to be" etcThen turns and says "who the hell wrote this sh*t anyway". Sums up exactly how I feel about this film. Have the Hollywood/Disney SS executed all the talented scriptwriters?Is there no one left who can write a good script? let alone tell a goodstory? Yet another, in a long long line of films, where they clearly assumethe audience sit mesmerised at the screen. Grazing on popcorn, a carerwiping the dribble from their chins as they grunt, shout and clap theirdelight at the 'preedddy' colours. Of course the audience won't notice plot holes so wide, you could drivewhole coach loads of inept directors and talent less scriptwriters intothem, never be seen again. (hurrah)e.g Why German soldiers obligingly and eagerly march on, just to bekilled so easily. etc The ludicrous plot! Husband must assassinate double agent wife or else.I'm sure the luvvies all congratulate themselves how great theirartistry is. My considered review:-THIS FILM IS FAECES - Don't waste your time. 4/10
