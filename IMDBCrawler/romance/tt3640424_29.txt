This story and its big drama is the kind of thing Humphrey Bogart didoften after he had success with "Casablanca". That is not the onlything that connects this movie with Bogart; it is a very traditional,even well-worn, type of Hollywood movie. The Bogart fare wasmelodramatic and plotted very carefully and in those elements this filmfails considerably.The story is small but as it goes it is rather dull, no other word forit, it is dull. It lacks drive and purpose and some unifying idea forthe audience to connect with after the grace period, say 20 minutes,when we still don't know how it will develop.The writing is truly lamentable; if this is what it takes to get amovie deal now the product is bound to be awful The pitch meeting onthe project would have been the most exciting thing because theexecution, in the script and on screen is lifeless, aimless and lackingin drama.Then there are the anachronisms, the language Pitt uses to superiors,the way people greet each other, the sense that non one had thefaintest idea of what the 1940s was like. The birth sequence deservesspecial citation: risible doesn't do it justice, it must be in the top3 worst and ludicrous scenes ever shot in the last 40 years.As history is not what this film was really about when Pitt seeks toprove, or otherwise, his wife's veracity, and she has to pay awell-known national anthem, it seemed perfectly fine if she offered upsome other tunes, for instance: "Die Fahne-hoch", "Die Wacht am Rhein",neither Pitt, nor the director, nor writer would have known thedifference.And in the end it reaches it's terrible conclusion and delivers anunwanted epilogue which adds a mawkishness to the whole experience. Italso signifies how bad the script was that it had to append such along-winded and pointless conclusion to the work.It's lucky for Bogie that he never saw this, and its for sure that hewould have passed on it, because he was a real professional who knew adud if he'd been offered it.
