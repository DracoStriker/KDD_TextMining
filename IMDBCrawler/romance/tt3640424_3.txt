You may have seen the preview for this movie; I would say that thatdoes not fully prepare you for the actual movie. It is a movie thatwill appeal to adults, both men and women, and it includes romance,sacrifice, and plenty of action and spy hi jinks. A very good script, with some great plot turns, and superior actingfrom both Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt in complex, challenging roles.My favorite bit: when they make love in a car in the Moroccan desertwith a sandstorm going on all around them. It is a good metaphor fortheir love story in the midst of the great chaos of World War II. Andit has a realistic feel, for the most part--for the sets in Casablanca(some good homage to the Bogart film, I would say also some Brandohomage in parts of Pitt's performance), and the time back in the UK(second favorite bit is during a party in London). One does get thesense of the all-out effort demanded to win the war, something we dowell to commemorate in these days when the last veterans of that mostepic event in history are at death's door. It is a Zemeckis film, from the school of film-making of StevenSpielberg, and that means your emotions are subject to the whim andwhimsy of the director's manipulation. Sometimes you are aware of that,but oftentimes you are not, and that makes it better (than, say,Forrest Gump). I will take the movie as a whole and suggest Oscar nominations fororiginal screenplay and both leading roles.
