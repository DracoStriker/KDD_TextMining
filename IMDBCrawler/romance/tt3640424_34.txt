Brad, a highly-ranked espionage agent in World War II,with a pilot background, gets hooked up with the Marian Cotillardcharacter, pulling a dangerous coup in Morocco, and then escaping tosafety in Britain, where they marry. As you're aware, allegations aremade to Brad that his bride (and the mother of a new child) is, infact, a spy, planted in Africa by the Germans, as a replacement for alegit French freedom fighter who was executed. Brad has reason tosuspect his mettle is just being tested.** Don't read below unless you've seen it **Spoilers ** Spoilers **Spoilers ** and plot questions 1> why didn't Marianne change sides, once she got to Britain? Confess,and switch sides? The Gestapo had less assets than the Brits inEngland, if things went sour -- she could have been a greatdouble-agent, passing bad info onto the Gestapo. lived happily everafter. when she finally owned up, she showed that she was aself-serving schemer. Sorry - it's a hard world. There are prices topay for lying--and betrayal.2> she (finally) gives herself away by not being able to play the pianolike the real person. No decent Espionage outfit would commit anoversight like that. The Gestapo would have gotten her lessons upfront, or, maybe on the sly in U.K. once she settled there, in case thesubject ever came up. With 3 weeks practice, I could play LaMarseillaise convincingly. It ain't a recital at Albert Hall.Apart from that, I am impressed that the production team didn't scripta typical clichéd happy ending. Even if she goes for option 1 above,you could still deliver a tragic conclusion by having a German agentfinally 'get to her' (lethally). It's just that her character didn'tstrike me as a German patriot - hence, I can't buy that she wouldjeopardize her new life, just to pass low grade info to the Axis side,which, by 1944, was obviously going to lose anyway.
