Pros:All actors are talented.Good story plot.smart conversations.goodcamera work. great war effects.Cons:somehow director failed to put youin the atmosphere of the 2nd war era, you still can feel like moderntimes.movie is a stereotype of showing a western agent kill many Germansoldiers like James Bond style is absurd & silly. in reality Nazisoldiers were very skilled and hard to beat whether by hand combat orby exchange shooting. so when are Hollywood going to stopunderestimating human mind? Worst part of this movie is directorattempting to shove the gay-lesbianism in the movie by showing twowomen openly living together in a lesbian setup, which was not possiblein the 40s as society was not (yet) tamed to accept these affairssocially. A classic Hollywood notorious move to naturalize gay-lesbianaffairs in history by re-writing history so that our new generationswould accept this non-natural affair into their lives. So for straightpeople please be aware of this point.
