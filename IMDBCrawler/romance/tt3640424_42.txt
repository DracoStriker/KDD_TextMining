This movie was contrived and predictable, and the acting and writingwere both horrible. I had high expectations and started laughing tomyself about 15 minutes in, but wondered if it was just me, or was itreally that bad? Then my husband looked over at me and said its not toolate to go to the Disney movie. There was zero chemistry between theleads, and the situations were so implausible as to be laughable. Couldhave been so much better, don't waste your time or money. The funniestscene? When the "couple" decides to spend a day without thinking aboutthe war and sets up their picnic blanket in sight of the burningaircraft in the back ground. The ending could have been so much bettertoo.
