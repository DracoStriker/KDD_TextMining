Les Crap ! When movies make fun of "Hollywood Movies" within themovie-THIS is that movie. Handsome star driven drivel that is overstylized in look and dialogue. While the impeccably dressed Brad Pitttakes on those lousy (and also quite well dressed) Nazis briefly inCasablanca to remind the audience who the bad guys were in WW Two, mostof the film centers around the trite and jejune dilemma of "true love"between the handsome soldier and his mademoiselle. "Allies' turns"Casablanca" on its tete, by truly making two people's Hill of Beansmuch more profound than the side show of the world going crazy whentrue Evil almost destroyed civilization. The movie reminds me a littleof the English Patient" without Any of the "good stuff" and all of the"love conquers all" self involvement. Plus Ralph Fiennes can actcircles around Brad. That the acting is uninteresting is notsurprising, but generally Robert Zemackis's directing is far betterthan this trivial effort. Usually in his box of Chocolat you know whatyou're going to get- not this le petit mort. Judah Shapiro
