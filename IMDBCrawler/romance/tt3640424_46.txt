Is she? Isn't she? Will he? Won't he? Most importantly: Who cares?It has all the surface accoutrements of a decent spy film... but theone major element it lacked for me was authenticity, which is quiteimportant in espionage!I never for one second believed that these big movie stars were thecharacters they played, even when all cover was dropped, and they werestriving for genuine emotion... An expensive storefront window withnothing of value behind it, this is Pitt's version of Jolie's "TheTourist" - lavish, and pointlessly hollow... (although I enjoyed "TheTourist", at least, since it made no pretense at being anything BUTflighty).I expected better from Zemeckis, but too long spent in the uncannyvalley of Motion-Capture Land has obviously dulled his senses, and lefthim unable to inject real soul into a movie that's ostensibly groundedin reality.
