Brad Pitt stars as Max Vatan, wing commander for a base in England.Years earlier he was sent into French Morocco to team up with anotherspy named Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard). As teasers show, theytake on a suicide mission, end up falling in love and having a lifetogether. Back in England, Vatan is told that his wife is a German spy,which is when the mystery starts - is she or isn't she. Unfortunately,it's also when the plot falls flat.I can think of so many other creative ways that this could have playedout, so that your choice would be more than a simple yes or no.Especially based on how they escaped from Morocco. But helas, the plotends up being very simple with only minor small periods of tension.Brad Pitt was OK, but he always seemed to be portraying someone who wasunfeeling to everything. Cotillard was terrific, but again, i think shecould only do so much with such a simple plot.The best part of the film was the cinematography with some terrificscenes of what bombing attacks at night were like. Costume design wasalso outstanding because both Pitt and Cotillard were stunning whendressed to the nines to go out. It's too bad that some of that designflair could not have been spun into the plot to make IT moreinteresting.6/10 at best is my rating. Allied is not terrible, but it's nothingspecial either. Enjoy.
