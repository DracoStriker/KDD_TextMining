Allied had my interest, for the cast, and for the story that I foundinteresting, but unfortunately the film is weak, Brad Pitt and MarionCotillard have a good chemistry, but their performances are onlycompetent, the rest of the cast does not add on Nothing, I admit that Ionly find out that Robert Zemeckis was the director of the filmcredits, a director who made the excellent trilogy Back to the Future,the spectacular Forrest Gump, and the great Cast Away, made this movieweak, and The worst that his direction is medium, he does not doanything different in the film, the script does not help much, withmoments uninteresting, and bad dialogues, and the action scenes are notexciting, but the film does well in the costumes Which is great, has agood costumes, but only stays in it, Allied is a weak and totallyforgettable film, deserved its indication of best costumes in Oscar,but this is one of the few good things in the movie.
