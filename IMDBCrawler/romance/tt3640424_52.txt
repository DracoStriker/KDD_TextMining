I was excited for this film after seeing the trailer and after watchingthis film there wasn't lots to be overly enjoyed about. The premise ofthe film sees two secret agents fall in love when one of them isaccused of being a spy. Brad Pitt is the lead in his film and he does avery good job in this film, he is charming When he needs to be and istough when he needs to be. You buy his character as he goes through thejourney of this film you attempt to feel sympathy for his character andthe situation. Marion cotillard plays his wife in this film and shedoes a good job in the film. You see her character development throughthe film and her character does grow and become more interesting as thefilm progresses. I also feel her and Pitt worked well together. But therest of the supporting cast had absolutely no purpose to them and youwon't care about them even when the film tries to do so. The story hasan interesting dynamic between the two leads which does create aninteresting mystery in the film. Unfortunately, the first half of thefilm feels like a completely different film and the shift instorytelling makes it feel disjointed and hard to care about certainthings in the film. The script has some great dramatic dialogue as yousee the two characters develop throughout the film. But this is a verylifeless affair with no humour at all and some of the smaller dialogueand moments feel very weak and bland that hurts the overall product.The style has some great action scenes in it that are very hardhitting, but they just don't come along enough an this film does end upfeeling allot longer then it actually is. Overall this is an alrightfilm buy unless you're really interested it might no be worth a watch.
