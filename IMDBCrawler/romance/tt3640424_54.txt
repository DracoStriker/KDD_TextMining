I watched the first hour of this movie, and although it was beautifullyphotographed and well-directed, it seemed to move very slowly for anespionage movie. Something about it didn't ring true, so I read thesummary and quit watching the rest.The first tip-off is the surname given to Brad Pitt: "Vatan". Thismovie is set during WWII. How many wing commanders in 1942 would havehad a Turkish or Iranian name in England at that time? The name givento the co- star in the film is "Beausejour" meaning "beautiful stay". Iask, "Did the writers intend that this name should have somesignificance?" I couldn't figure it out. As other reviews may tell you, a totally obnoxious executive from theBritish Special Operations Executive (SOE) tells Vatan that his wife isa German spy. And if Vatan is not prepared to expose his wife, we seethe SOE guy open a drawer with a gun in it, implying that he wasprepared to kill Vatan on the spot. Here comes the illogical part, as Igive away the essence of the end of the film.Vatan and Beausejour are now living in London and they have a one yearold daughter, Anna. It turns out that the Germans threatened Beausejourwith harming their daughter if she didn't spy for them. She kept this asecret from her husband, and the movie proceeds from there to itsdepressing conclusion. Now, I ask you, "What would happen logically in real life?" The wifewould tell her husband of the German threat who would then relate thisto his superior, and they all would wind up working with the SOE on howto have Beausejour fool the Germans with meaningless British"intelligence". (Another issue was raised to which I did not find theanswer. SOE claimed that Vatan's wife wasn't the real Beausejour.)The excitement in a more logical movie would revolve around the issueof "How long can the British continue to fool the Germans and not havesomething dire happen to the child, Anna?" I think that could be a muchmore intelligent movie which would move along at a faster pace.
