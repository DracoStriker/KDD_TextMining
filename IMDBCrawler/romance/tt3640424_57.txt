As a fan of WW2 films I have to say this is the second time Mr Pitt hasappeared in a period film with an idiotic plot SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS So Brad goes to Morocco on a secret mission, he is apparently FrenchCanadian but speaks like um Brad Pitt.He connects with a major french spy, an aging Ms Cottiliard, who he hasno photo of and has never seen ( why? ) - and they proceed to murderthe German ambassador in the most ridiculously planned operation of thewar.Fast forward and he marries her and then a year later ( after many airraids that take place long after the BoB ??? ) they are living wellwhen Brad is called to the office and told she is a spy for the Nazi's- well maybe, we'll know on Monday so take the weekend off but don'tinvestigate this matter! Oh - by the way, if she is guilty YOU have tokill her yourself ( um - why? ) So shockingly Brad investigates thecrap out of the matter and in doing so gets a fellow spy killed, blabsto his lesbian sister and eventually kills several Nazi spy's in London( no need to try to turn them, to get them to feed false info to theboys in Berlin, maybe save a few thousand lives in Normandy - no sirree- Brad shoots em! ) Then he tries to escape with the wife but isstopped at the airfield, when she shoots herself and then FIN Utterlystupid
