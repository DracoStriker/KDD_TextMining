A Franco/Canadian secret mission is an unusual twist for a WWII story.This and the setting of the first part of "Allied" reminded me of "TheEnglish Patient". Canadian Max (Pitt) is sent to Casablanca for adangerous mission. Marianne (Cotillard) is the French agent already inplace to help him.Out of the desert and in London, "Allied" moves into a differentterritory, albeit still with plenty of style. Max and Marianne'swartime romance in exotic settings turns into a real family, but doubtsarise about Marianne's identity.London during the war as the main setting for two thirds of the movielooked very realistic. I did not mind what could be the historicalinaccuracy of the Blitz, because the bombing added a layer of drama tothe story.I particularly liked the scene during the party, with Sing, Sing Singplaying in the background. It is a slightly menacing tune and itcomplemented perfectly the atmosphere of tension, suspicion and slightdesperation.Even if I have never been a Brad Pitt fan, he did a good job playingquiet Max, a man of a few words who sees his new world disintegrating.One can easily imagine him as a long-term bachelor falling for thebeautiful, brave French partisan. Cotillard was also convincing as theambiguous "femme fatale". Contrary to what some reviewers wrote, plentyof chemistry between the two, but also tenderness.If you like movies with a solid plot, linear storytelling, believablecharacters, difficult choices, great costumes and soundtrack, then youshould like this.P.S. couple of remarks: Pitt's French was not the best and no way hecould have passed for Parisian, but that did not bother me too much.The final scene is a couple of minutes too long, but again, not a majorproblem. However, what a relief to follow a good plot without the zig-zagging in time, overused but often useless editing style.
