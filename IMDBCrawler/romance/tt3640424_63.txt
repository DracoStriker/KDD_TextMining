Allied depicts historical events during WWII. Even parachuting intoMorocco. I am not disappointed with this film but enjoy its plausibility becauseI have studied clandestine operations conducted by the French andBritish. These characters roles ring true. Keeping ones cover is paramount-the romance and falling in love arepossible. Remember Pitt's character had flown to France to supply the Resistanceso he was involved with ongoing military interventions. Pitt is noHumprey Bogart but he's a definitive actor that maintains notability ineach of his films. Provided Marion takes the spotlight - remember a co-star down playingtheir role elevates these interactions. Many military attaches' were rotated in the European theater forpurposes of keeping their covers intact. The scene where Pitt kills the Nazi officer because his cover was blownspeaks to this. Marion's character has an excellent arch-being acounter spy blackmailed into continuing to protect their child.Sophie's Choice twist.The plot speaks to why spies ought not to fall in love, the risk andlies they live out catch up to the truth sooner or later. "Both people f' each other and now they're dead" Pitts line-referringto what happens when spy's fall in love-at the breakfast table. Script and plot points are in sync. Music is balanced. A seamless edit.In a world of SS Nazi suspicion of everyone - civilian men must actreserved to save their skin; beautiful women can be flamboyant.Especially when it comes to cutting the deck... metaphoricallyspeaking."Max, you're a bloody fool." Tag line.Allied accomplishes subtlety which is the spy game genre.
