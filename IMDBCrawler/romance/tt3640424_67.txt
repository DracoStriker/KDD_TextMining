I'm not a big fan of these WW-type films, any only decided to watch itas I'm a Brad Pitt fan. Well I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised!The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard was convincing asthey played their characters exceptionally. The winner here is thedirecting and writing - executed perfectly with great cinematographyand editing. The pace was a little slow but the excellent ending madeup for it! Very enjoyable and it's a 8/10 from me.
