Robert Zemeckis has mostly made audience-pleasing movies (I Wanna HoldYour Hand, Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump,Cast Away). He occasionally opts for more mature content, such as2012's "Flight". "Allied" is of the latter nature, although like theformer group it looks to the past for inspiration.Brad Pitt plays a Canadian intelligence officer during WWII who goes toCasablanca (where else?) to kill the German ambassador. While there hehooks up with Marion Cotillard's resistance fighter and they eventuallyget married. But once they move to England, he learns that there'ssomething that he didn't know about her.The movie makes sure to set the stage with the era's music andcostumes. But the most important part remains the moral dilemma thatPitt's character faces. It's not any sort of masterpiece, but theacting makes up for the movie's flaws. Much of the camera-work helpstell the story (notice the scene where Pitt looks at Cotillard in themirror).Overall, I recommend it.
