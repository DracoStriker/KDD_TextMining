Although at first it looked like a cross between "Casablanca and"Inglourious Basterds", "Allied" soon settles into an unusual andcompelling romance.To enjoy this film set in WW2 you just have to go with it. During anoperation in Casablanca, Canadian Max Vatan (Brad Pitt), a BritishIntelligence agent, falls in love with a beautiful French resistancefighter, Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cottillard). Back in England theymarry and have a baby. However, it turns out she could be a spy. And soit goes until an ending that leaves Brad about as desolate as he was in"Se7en".The film attempts to capture the feeling of those romantic adventurefilms that were actually made during WW2; films it must be said thatwere as much removed from reality as this one is. When Max fakes hisway onto a plane to pop over to Nazi Occupied France to prove a point,it's not too far removed from the sort of thing Errol Flynn got up toin war movies back in the 1940's.Brad is fine as the secret service agent although the script allows fora very cavalier approach to the supposedly secret stuff. However, alongwith Brad's style and charisma, Marion Cotillard's stillness andpresence give "Allied" that big movie feel that elevates it from otherWW2 dramas such as "Foyles War". Even if Max and Marianne don't quitereach the emotional heights of Rick and Ilsa, by the halfway mark wecare what happens to them.Director Robert Zemeckis' composer of choice, Alan Sylvestri,contributed an atmospheric and emotive score. It has a more modern vibethan the sounds of those films of the 1940's with their wall-to-wallorchestral scores by maestros such as Steiner, Waxman, and Rozsa.Zemeckis wrings every drop of emotion out of his films ? "Contact","Castaway", "Forrest Gump" ? and so he does with "Allied". Despite theimplausibilities, the powerful love story drives the film.
