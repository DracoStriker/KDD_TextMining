Brad Pitt could probably do this sort of film in his sleep, but fullcredit to the man, he does them well.This is a stylish and interesting film, that while isn't reallyanything we have seen before, is decent enough entertainment.The leads do their job, the script throws in a few surprises. I don'tthink anyone involved will say it's the best work that they've everdone, but it will entertain a lot of people.With decent films that aren't special effect heavy or part of afranchise in short supply, this film is a nice escape.
