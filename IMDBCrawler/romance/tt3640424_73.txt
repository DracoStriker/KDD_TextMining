The first half of the movie is rather dull and long, waiting for thechief interest which involves the relationship of the two maincharacters, both in the business of espionage. The second half, becauseof the anticipated denouement, is of course much more exciting. But thereal question is simply: can love overcome ideological conflict? Cansomeone spying for the WWII allies fall and STAY in love with a personspying for the Nazis? The answer here is rather hard to defend butgiven human nature, sexuality, family values, and sheer directorialinnovation anything could be true or false. I did not really enjoy thefilm, save for the exposed backside of Brad Pitt which was impressive!
