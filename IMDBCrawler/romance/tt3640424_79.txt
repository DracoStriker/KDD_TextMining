In 1942, a Canadian intelligence officer in North Africa encounters afemale French Resistance fighter on a deadly mission behind enemylines. When they reunite in London, their relationship is tested by thepressures of war. Allied stars Brad Pitt, Marion Cotillard and JaredHarris and it's a Spy film set on a time of War that has it's ownstyle, touch and a lot of romance alongside with some pretty goodaction sequences and at first i wasn't sure what to expect but i wasvery much surprise and except the two great performances by the 2 leadsthe movie also had a great 3rd act with some pretty good suspensefulscenes and a very touching and dramatic ending that i pretty muchloved. Now as far as flaws go the movie is 2 hours and 4 minutes andunfortunately it does drag sometimes within it's pacing and some scenescould probably cut out maybe? But other than that Allied was still avery enjoyable and great drama directed by the great Robert Zemeckisjust don't expect another Cast Away or Forrest Gump because you will bedisappointed. (7.5/10)
