The key to understanding and appreciating Allied is knowing what kindof film it is. The trailers made the film look like it was a genre film-- some hybrid of a wartime action and espionage film. But it isn'teither of these. It is simply a drama about two people in the contextof WWII, how they come to trust one another, and what happens when thattrust is put in question. In the same way that Flight (another goodZemeckis film) was made by its trailer to look like a courtroom dramainstead of a dramatic character study, the trailer for Allied misledthe public as to what the film was about, and that's never a recipe forcustomer satisfaction. If you take the film on its own merits, at facevalue, I don't think you'll be disappointed. The performances are good,the period sets and costumes are outstanding, the cinematography ismore than attractive, and the script is suspenseful and moving. It maynot be the world's greatest film, but I did not feel cheated by it inany way, and you'll probably be fine as long as you're not expectingsomething like one of the Mission:Impossible films. Like some of thefilms directed by Pitt's friend, George Clooney (e.g. The Good Germanand Goodnight & Good Luck), Allied hearkens back to character-drivenHollywood dramas of the 1940s and 50s. If you don't like Allied, youprobably haven't seen enough older films and/or have spent too muchtime playing video games (and expect your films to be like them).
