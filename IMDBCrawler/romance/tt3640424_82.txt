Zemeckis knows how to tell stories, and how to keep focus and all that.Yes, the cinematography is perfect, the rhythm is perfect and eventhere is chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. But Pittseems to be specializing himself in Nazi-killer roles, where he canshoot around just anyone with no moral implications, making the plot tolose most of its human dimension. I have no problem with going once andagain to those old good days where Britons win, so they can keep theirheads up against evil Germans at least in the dark of a movie theater,but I am personally growing sick of those trigger-happy macho-typedie-hard and would welcome some deeper plot where human lives count.All.
