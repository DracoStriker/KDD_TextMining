I loved the look & feel of Casablanca, I loved Winslet in her partbecause she was quite convincing. Brad however... cardboard! Dunno,maybe he was pining for Angie while making this but it would have beenJolie if those two would FIGURE OUT there's nobody else in Hollywoodgood looking enough for either of them to breakup over! NOT that Ireally give a sh|t... Pusey's Pusey! The crash of the German plane inthe backyard plus the AA fire leading up to that was a great visual, aswas the depiction of WW2 London streets. His obsession with getting tothe truth about her was also a good aspect of the story and needed.Overall.... EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE LOST $45M ON THIS ONE, it's a goodrental but NOT a car-starter. Gibson's "Hacksaw Ridge" was a muchbetter story, easily.
