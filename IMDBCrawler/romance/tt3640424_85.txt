I was really surprised by this movie, when i watched the trailer ithought it could be enjoyable bit I have to say that it's definitelybetter than I expected. Robert Zemeckis was able to put together aninteresting story between historical war drama and action. The movieit's well directed and the cast works very well. I was a fan ofZemeckis some years ago and i tough he has lost the touch in it's laterproduction but in this one i have really nothing to regret for. Thehistorical environment it's well reproduce and everything it's verybelievable. The movie moves between an historical war story in thebeginning to a drama in the middle to a spy action movie close to theend..and always keeping the viewer stuck in the chair. Well donephotography and visual effects ( just the Brad Pitt landing seems insome ways fake) add to the movie some more credibility but what worksmore it 's a script that create a very enjoyable entertainment
