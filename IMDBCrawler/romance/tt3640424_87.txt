1485/5000 I began to see her having heard that she was very bad. Iimagined the worst. Luckily, it was not so bad. Let it look even if youforget it soon.He has moments when you recognize Robert, but in itself, does not reachhis level. It goes very far in every respect. If somethingcharacterizes this director, it is how he knows how to put the camerato tell you the story with beautiful blueprints, without having to makea succession of close-ups and detailed plans. This time he does it atsome point but it is not the characteristic thing.The love story does not become, they are not seen in love at any time.I'd rather say it's a spy movie. The film has several parts, so tospeak.None of the actors are great, rather they are to cover file. But thewhole movie is like this. At no time is it seen in the film that it ismade with great seriousness, rather, it had to be done and done.The photograph is beautiful, without being an excellent photograph.Her direction at times, as at first seeing the cartridge and the car orthe moment we see paper on the table and she walking that are beautifuland spectacular. It does not get boring but in no time gets to get youdo not blink.The love scene is totally overpowering and I'm too prepared.The effects, while well-made, are not spectacular.I'll wait impatiently for Zemeckis's next movie, to see if it takesaway this bittersweet taste.
