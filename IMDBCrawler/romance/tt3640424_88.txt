The is a fictional drama. That's really important to remember, and withthat in mind, this is a great film. OK, there are a few inaccuracies,for the sake of entertainment, but all this film wants to be is anentertaining film about espionage set during WW2. The setting is almostirrelevant but gives it some context, so watch it with an open mind,and make sure your head isn't up your arse so you can enjoy it for whatit is.
