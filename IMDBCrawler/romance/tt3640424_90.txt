"Allied" is a film with the daunting task of attempting to channel oneof the greatest films in the history of American cinema: "Casablanca."While it is not entirely successful, there is nonetheless compellingstorytelling and great performances! Like Bogart and Bergman in"Casablanca," Brad Pitt and Marion Cotilard are the star-crossed loversin a spy drama with the backdrop of World War II.The film is essentially a two-act drama. The first part culminates in ashocking and perfectly carried out assassination by the dynamic duo ofMax and Marianne. Cotillard's character Marianne and Pitt's role of Maxare impersonating a married couple in Casablanca. Behind the scenes, they are plotting the death of the Nazi ambassador.This part of the film is somewhat anticlimactic because it turns outthat Hitler wanted to get rid of the ambassador anyway! The second andmore compelling section is the drama of whether Marianne, who has nowmarried Max and delivered a child during the London blitz, may be aGerman spy! Or...is she only being threatened and "boxed in"? Director RobertZemeckis is a veteran filmmaker who is an excellent storyteller. Thefilm is effectively costumed and includes interesting camera angles,especially through the use of reflections of mirrors.While "Allied" never matches the great appeal of "Casablanca," it isnonetheless a good yarn with two standout performances. Cotilarddelivers an outstanding voice-over in the moving ending of this goodaction/suspense film.Thumbs up!
