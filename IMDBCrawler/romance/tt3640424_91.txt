"We believe your wife is a German spy." While fighting and trying todefeat the Nazi's in WWII Max (Pitt) meets Marianne (Cotillard). Whilesetting up an ambush the two begin to develop romantic feelings foreach other. What starts off as a military relationship becomessomething more and the two get married. While in London Max is toldthat his wife may be a spy. He has 2 days to uncover the truth or hewill be forced to kill her. This is a movie I was excited about seeing.I love movies about spies and history so this was right up my alley.The first half hour is very slow so be ready for that. The movie thenstarts to pick up but never quite got to the point where I wanted it tobe. This movie reminded me of the Tourist. It was much better than thatone but had the same feel of a movie trying too hard to be importantand it came off feeling forced with no real heart. It could have beenmy high expectations but I was just really disappointed in this.Overall, not terrible but a disappointing that didn't seem to have anyreal heart at all. I sadly give this a B-.
