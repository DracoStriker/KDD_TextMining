So close to being something remarkable that the screen it plays on cansometimes fold out and reveal lush detail of romance and intrigue ofold that we folk just don't see anymore. The pacing is just gallopingon ahead when the actors need allowance to breathe and spread theirtalents into the cogs and springs of their characters. Alas, thecentral romance is a tad rushed, less Bergman/Bogart and more modernhack rom-com, which leads to suffering on-screen and off.I do appreciate the return of Bob Zemeckis, after his CG adventures atthe turn of the millennium. He's got some talent, but his screenplaysand their authors need to be allowed to insert a bit more life and witinto the works. That being said, the final suspense sequences withCotillard waiting for her husband in the car are so good, it comesclose to being forgiven for its horribly muddled storytelling. Worth awatch for the middle Americans who want a gentle throwback to thethrillers of WW2 and Hitchcockian/Watergate-era paranoia alike.
