It's hard to define the genre of this film, but it was a decent romanceand a decent thriller... Marion Cottillard makes every film a mystery.Some say there was no tension and they are wrong, nobody knew if she isa spy or not right until the end scene. I enjoyed every moment of thisfilm from action scenes right until the ending credits. Quite likelythe film will not get a single Oscar, but the story and performancewere stellar. I felt deeply emotional at the end of the film. It willbe sad if a fake romance of Lalaland will win anything over thissuspense love story...
