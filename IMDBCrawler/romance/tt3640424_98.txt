Firstly the goodies: This romantic WW2 flick brings back all thenostalgic memories of World War 2. Two gorgeous lead pair try and giveall to make it an emotional saga. Brad and Marion look to be a matchmade in heaven :-)...the most natural and attractive screen pair (weshould have many more flicks for sure). great visuals and SpecialEffects. Some obvious disappointments are: Brad looks surprisinglytired and no energy or passion in carrying out the required role...toorestrained.. and looks quite aged even though his body is quite slim..i couldn't see the vigor he used to display in his younger ones (heshould have shown more passion and response given the circumstances asthe role demanded). Marion's role is rather limited but dazzleswhenever she is on screen (her background could have been exploredfurther).. as the story doesn't have mystery or aura.. it all fizzlesout and the climax is rather timid and no twists and turns (since itwas not real and fiction, the story could have been tight and moreinteresting). Overall i felt the movie lacked that extra thrill andexcitement which i definitely feel whenever i watch "saving privateRyan", "the pianist" or even "enemy at the gates". Just for the sheermoments of the protagonists we can absolutely enjoy this uncut gem.
