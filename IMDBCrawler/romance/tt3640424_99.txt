Solid movie with a great performance by Marion Cotillard. It'sdefinitely a love story first and foremost, and a spy movie a distantsecond. Brad Pitt was a little hit or miss for me. Most of the time hewas fine, but there were a couple scenes where he was doing little morethan a table read of the script. It's probably a bit too long, but itdoesn't drag by any means, just could have been tightened up a bit.Great chemistry (obviously) and well placed tension kept me locked infrom start to finish. The emotion was there, but could have beencaptured so much better. This had the potential to be one of the bestdramas of the year, but comes up shy of great.
