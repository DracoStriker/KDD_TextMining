I have nothing against sex. I love it, I love watching it but this waspainful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. Ithink it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what thedirector was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind ofstory with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest TheDreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min toget invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way tolong for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like thetitle says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.Now for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflectingon a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in ahealthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you haveduring the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I wouldnot recommend this to anyone.
