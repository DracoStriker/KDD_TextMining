As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect. Kind of like a hybridof Enter the Void, Nymphomaniac, The Lobster and Weekend. You can feelthe love that has gone into this film.The sex is both beautiful and ugly. It's not porn, more like anaestheticized version of somebody's personal sex tape, but one designedto provoke contemplation more than any other response. To feel any morereal it would need to be in the style of a documentary, which wouldhave the effect of distancing you from the characters. I didn't feellike I was experiencing the story directly (as I do with good suspensemovies), but I did want things to work out well for the characters. Ifyou judge a movie by how much the pacing and suspense immerses you, youwon't enjoy Love. If you can be immersed into a movie's atmosphere andwant something to feed your imagination, then you will get a lot fromit.A lot of reviews and comments on IMDb seem to say it is not a thoughtprovoking movie, or that it is pretentious, yet the poster was moved towrite about their thoughts on it, so it certainly isn't empty. I foundtalking about it can result in the conversation going to some veryinteresting places.It has earned a place in the history of cinema, and is hopefully a stepaway from the feelings of shame people feel about sex, a step towardsgreater freedom in art, culture and cinema.
