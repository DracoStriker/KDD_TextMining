I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this... the IMDbdescription says Electra is unstable - sorry, nothing wrong withElectra... Murphy on the other hand is profoundly mentally ill. Themovie should have been called "Borderline Personality Disorder". Thewriting is pure high school and Karl Glusman is as wooden as any slabrider on CSI. There is essentially no plot and none of the charactersevokes any response in me - well maybe loathing for Murphy - what an(expletive) excretory orifice! His violence and his justification forhis mindless violence - "I'm an American an we fight for what's oursblah blah" - the police don't stick him in jail but befriend him -what? He's with hot Electra and they go to a sex club - he has fewwomen whilst there but loses his tiny mind when he finds her with a guyand a woman (a dream scenario) - hello stupid - it's Paris not DesMoines!! Why would you go/stay in Paris if you're a narrow mindedpillock? This reviewing effort is far more than this abominationdeserves - it's not even worth fast forwarding to the amateurish sexscenes (clearly directed by a 14 year old). In a just world this wouldbe a career ender for all involved.
