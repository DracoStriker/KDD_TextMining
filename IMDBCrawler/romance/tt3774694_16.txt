Had potential...but wastes it on cheap publicity stunts and a plot thatgoes nowhereA man, Murphy, is stuck in a dead-end relationship with a woman hedoesn't love. The couple also have an unplanned young son, adding toMurphy's feelings of being trapped. He starts to think of his previousgirlfriend - Electra, how perfect everything was, and how and whyeverything fell apart. Then he learns that she has disappeared...The movie had potential. The intrigue of the disappearance of Electra,the regret that their (perfect) relationship didn't work out, thesuffocating relationship he is currently in, his depression over whereeverything has ended up - these all made for some interesting potentialpaths for the movie.But, alas, it was not meant to be.None of these threads go anywhere. In the end, nothing is resolved andthere is no point to the whole long exercise. And, yes, it is a longexercise - 2 1/4 hours, with about half of that made up of padding. Somany scenes which add nothing to the movie, and just make you morebored.From the start you know it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair -the pacing is slow from the beginning - but you hope to be rewardedwith something profound at the end. No such luck.What the movie will be most remembered for is its explicit sex scenes.While not really that new anymore (Nine Songs, anyone?), many of thescenes are just there for shock / controversy / publicity value. Sad to see that Gaspar Noe has ended up making pretentious crap likethis. Irreversible was brilliant and heralded Noe as director to befollowed. However, since then he hasn't made a decent movie. Hisprevious movie, Enter the Void, was even more pointless and pretentiousthan Love. He is turning out to be a one-hit wonder.
