I went to watch this movie in 3d in Mexico based on some video reviewsI had seen that said it was an "experience" that had to be lived. Howfar was that from the truth.Love in 3d, which is the title the film had in Mexico, is a tedious,unnecessarily long film that has no real story, statement ormessage.Its a long porn video with a bad script. The film is supposedto pose a question about what love is, but never really addresses it ortakes any kind of position about it. Furthermore, it extends its scenesway past it should. The ending sequences, for example, are just endlessquasi-reiterations of the previous scenes that add nothing to the film.You think it is over, and boom! another sex sequence, and then anotherand another. The "cuts" the film uses are also poorly executed. I understand usingthe cuts for when you jump in time between the scenes but if you donot, why do you still use it? Half of the time the cuts are used, themovie does jump in time,but the other half is just an annoying blink ofthe screen to come back to exactly the same point.If this had been a 15 minute short then it might actually had madesense, but a 2 and a half hour long movie was definitely way more thana stretch. Save yourself the time and money.
