Was this movie made for gays and women only? Love is one of the worstever, if not the worst, for the DOUBLE STANDARD against men. If youread the" view content advisory" Here is what you will read. From the opening frame, there are several graphic sex scenes with lotsof nudity.Female nudity; breasts, bottoms, and pubic hair are often shown,however there are no direct views of the vulva/vagina. Male nudity;full frontal and quite often very explicit.The film graphically deals with a past love affair that lasted for twoyears and saw the two main characters engage in all sorts of casual andless casual sexual practices, including an attempted threesome with atransgender person. Many of these practices are shown in graphicdetail.All the sex is un-simulated (meaning the sex is really happening).In one scene two females and one male engage in a threesome.An erect penis is shown many times throughout the film.Two or three times an ejaculation is shown, including one scene where awoman's hand is scene masturbating an erect male penis (which is theonly thing on screen), before the male ejaculates directly at thecamera lens.Quite a lot of sexually-related talks throughout.So what could possibly be the reason for this except that it was madefor gay men and straight women. The Double Standard is alive and well,even in NC-17 and NR and unrated movies.If anyone has a clue as to whyit was done this way, please respond.
