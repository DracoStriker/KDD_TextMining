While I didn't try to think of the song, the line "Baby don't hurt me... don't hurt me no more" came to mind. And it's not like it doesn'tsuit or fit with the movie (if you excuse the pun). And let's get thisout of the way straight ahead: If you didn't or don't already know,this movie has scenes of explicit sex in it. And it begins with amasturbation scene, to shock you right out of the gate (or those whowill be offended by it of course).It goes without saying that this is full of nudity. You may not haveseen this actors before, but you'll see everything of them in this.It's not only being naked physically, but also mentally. Layingemotions out there and going through motions (literally andmetaphorically) is draining. Both for the actors and the viewers. Thestory is simple. It's about love or the idea of it.Which brings us back to our initial question. Are we able to appreciatewhat we have? Or do we long for things we can't have? Can we be happywith the person we spend our time or is the temptation for somethingnew too big? Obviously that depends on the individual and their "world"view. Also their emotional state. The movie is as you can tell not aneasy watch ... for multiple reasons. The message is clear though ...
