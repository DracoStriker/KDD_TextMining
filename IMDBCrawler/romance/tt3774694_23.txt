...not just to film-making as an art, but also to porn. This is by farthe most deplorable excuse of a motion picture I have ever seen. Thescript is what a 9-year-old living in a cave without an Internetconnection imagines sex to be like. I've seen better acting inBrazzers. BRAZZERS!!!! The scenes are making 80's porn look like amasterpiece. And the music?!?!? Hahahahah!! Yo, like, how old is GasparNoe, mid-50s? I saw he's married, but I don't think he's ever bangedhis wife in over 20 years and this is the closest thing of ever seeinga naked person on screen. Honestly, after seeing this, I would giveTwlight an Oscar. Damn, I would Gigli one, because at least that was sobad that it was hilarious. This is just pure cringe. Don't get mewrong, I've seen Nymphomaniac, Salo, Fat Girl, Last Tango in Paris,Shame, and probably a dozen more 'art films', all good. But this isjust cheese-balls central. I honestly don't see how this got Cannesrecognition...
