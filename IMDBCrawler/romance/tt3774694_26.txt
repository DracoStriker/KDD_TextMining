First of all. I'm a huge fan of Gaspar Noé, so my review may be biasedsomewhat by that. Still, this movie delves into subject matter veryunlike Enter the Void, and differs greatly also in its flawlessexecution. There are many silent moments, as is Gaspar's style, butthey aren't empty and vacuous, like in Enter the Void, meant to renderin the viewer a sense of aimlessness and confusion, and they're notmeant to give you a respite from the vibrant sexuality of the filmeither. Instead they suffuse exactly the tender sentiment Gaspar was seeking tomeld into his project. The film is a tremendous achievement, hissomatic style vibrates from the screen and seduces you into thephysicality of love. You feel aroused, no doubt, but it's an envelopingarousal, not the two dimensional kind of appeal one would expect from amovie with this caliber of sexuality. No, this is four dimensional;indulgent and honest and raw and desperate and human. The spectacularperformances by the relatively unknown actors deliver aching, intimateand haunting sensations. You're there with them. That's the director'stouch and it's not easy to achieve. The story is very deep, its foreground tragedies very sharply felt andyou're left sad, vulnerable, full of regret and yet also gratitude thatyou were able to experience love of that magnitude, with all its divineglory and cruelty without actually being stuck in the characters lives. And yet it was a just a movie. And yet it wasn't.
