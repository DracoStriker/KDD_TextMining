Gaspar Noe at his best. I love this film, watched it twice. It takes alot to make me watch a film twice especially a new released. It's anarty and very well made film about love. It's not always rainbows andbutterflies. What I love about Gaspar Noe is he takes risks andexperiment with the films. Most of his films are controversial thenpeople start liking it as no one likes a change in the beginning and Ilove creativity. This film has a very simple plot, simply made withsimple acting if you want to watch it expecting some unrealistic cheesyrom com Hollywood commercial film because name of the film is LOVE thenthis is not for you. Reading people reviews here, repetition of theword "PORN" because of unsimulated sex scenes and a lot of sex scenes.There is a good story to the film and the sex scenes compliments withit. I have always been in favour of unsimulated sex as it is one ofnatural act which every adult goes through. It's about time when peopleshould watch sex scenes without feeling uncomfortable and without theidea that every time you watch unsimulated sex scene you have to playwith yourself. I just find it ridiculous, it is just a natural act. Getover it and fix your brain. If people feel uncomfortable with that dosome research before you go and watch a film if unsimulated sex makesyou feel uncomfortable why did you go on the first place to watch it?A great film !! must watch !!
