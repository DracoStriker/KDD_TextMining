I haven't quite made up my mind about this film. I don't think I'veenjoyed it, however I believe it's a great film to analyse.You can definitely feel it's a Noé film, the cuts, the speed, thecolors, the characters, the extra 15 min that weren't really necessary,etc.. Love - in my opinion it's a good title because I felt the couple was inlove, and that this film was about love and represents a real couple,like in Blue Valentine.Sex scenes - I kind of understand it, you don't often see real couplesmaking love in films, you just see actors compelled to look hot as hellso that everyone else that's watching feels bad about their bodies anda sexual desires. Despite all of this I think there are too manyexplicit scenes which add nothing to the story.Murphy - I'm not a big fan of analogies, mainly the ones that areforced just because. That said, I didn't get the analogy in thebeginning, in my point of view, it has no logic. The same goes forElectra. - I felt Murphy was really in love, what I didn't get was, inthe midst of almost 2h of love, why does he keep cheating. If you lovesomeone, which he apparently does, you don't have room for some randomgirl, to whom you speak at a party for 5 min, that agrees with yourideas, exactly the ones your girlfriend doesn't. I didn't feel this soI don't understand his need for cheating.Voice over - I see a lot of people complaining about this, well I likedthe emotion and reality it expressed, mainly when his at home with themother of his child.There was a little annoying thing, I started feeling that this was sortof a biography of Noé, it had to many obvious details about him like itwas an Ode to Noé...didn't get.Once again, I think it's a good film to analyse and think about if youhave the time and interest.
