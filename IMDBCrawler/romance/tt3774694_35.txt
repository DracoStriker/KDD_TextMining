I often joke with friends about the fact that if you film it, it's notprostitution, and this film is exactly that. I guess it is creative,but boy, a money shot within the first moments of a "film"? WeAmericans are often considered prudish vs our European counterparts,but this film has more in common with porn than with an art film. Howmuch does an actress get paid to swallow on camera? Compared to Irreversible in the description, in which a BRUTAL rapesequence that goes on and on, makes me wonder what people won't do onfilm. Surely there are redeeming qualities to the camera work and lighting,but where does the line get drawn? Snuff films?? I'd never be one to stifle creativity, but this just seems tasteless,though I'm not sure that's what she said.
