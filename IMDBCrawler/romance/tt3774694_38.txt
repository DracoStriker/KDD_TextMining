Yeah, the sex is uncomfortable to watch, but the fact that it is shownlike it is in this movie is not what you end up walking away with ifyou became emotionally involved in the plot and the characters - themeaning.It illustrates pretty well how destructive uncontrollable sexual urgescan be - something that someone magnifying the mere fact of theporno-ness might miss. It's not glamorizing sex. It may look glamorousto you on film, but then you watch the characters suffer horribly fortheir decisions, destroy their relationships, and their lives.If anything, this movie really illuminates the lesson of "you don'tknow what you got till its gone"- you might not realize how much youactually love someone until you've hurt them so much that they neverwant to see you again, or even drive them to their own destruction, andyours.Good lessons. It's not all about the sex. If you can get past watchingpeople having sex which I'm sure most of the people watching do anywayson the regular, and watch it like there's a message in there somewhere,you might get something out of itOf course the premise at face value sounds like such a sad money grab -but if you've already watched another Noe movie like Enter the Void andare expecting to be moved, there is a similar payoff or take-away
