This film tells the story of a man trapped with his wife and child, yethe keeps on thinking about his ex-girlfriend who is not contactable.The story then winds back in time to tell how his relationships withhis ex-girlfriend and his wife come about.I have heard about the gratuitous explicit sex scenes in the film, andindeed there is a prolonged sex scene every five minutes. The story isquite interesting, as the man reflects and reminisces about Elektra,who is so adventurous that she becomes increasingly unstable. Theproblems encountered by the man are quite real life, and viewers caneasily relate to his situation. What strikes me is that the lightingeffects of the film is very remarkable, the use of focused lightingenhances the mood a lot. The slow strobe effect in the swingers' clubis captivating. Overall, "Love" is worth a watch as it depicts reallife relationship problems.
