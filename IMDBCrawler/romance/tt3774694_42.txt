Love is Gaspar Noe's latest film. It's essentially porn. Long, drawnout sequences of sex throughout. But there's a story, and that's whatcould be interesting about this film. Not since the early 70's haspornographic films experimented telling actual stories instead of justgetting straight to business. Nymphomaniac is the last film of themodern era that attempted this, and it absolutely blew me away. Thiswould've been fascinating, but instead, it's PAINFULLY boring. Thestory line and dialogue sucks. I didn't feel for anyone in this film.The acting was extremely stilted, but in porn films that's pretty muchthe norm. The cinematography is the only standout. It's beautiful tolook at, as most Gaspar Noe films are. However, I despised the blackscreen that would appear every time there was a cut. As well as themany shots of the main character standing inside a doorway with hisback turned to the camera, listening to an annoying voicemail. Why didhe do that? Why would he think that would work? If there's a profoundreason for those two editing decisions, I'd like to know.. not that itwould make me feel any differently, I still hate it. Love is not only amissed opportunity, it's a film I'll never remember, or want toremember.
