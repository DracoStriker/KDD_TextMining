This is definitely not a film that will appeal to all. Some of thescenes are in fact very graphic but what they portray is not porn....For anyone that has lived through some of the scenes in this film itwill be very easy to understand why they were included. This filmportrays life as it is for some. Those that have not lived thesemoments will have a very hard time understanding their necessity..This film portrays much of the torment that flows through the minds ofthose that have been caught up in the intimacy of a profound mental andphysical relation that goes beyond the stereotypical roles thatcontemporary and politically correct society likes to show.The film is dark, full of anguish, torment, fear and pain whenconfronted with the elation of powerful love and sex.It is a film about emotion, from a darker point of view, it is a filmabout those on the edge, about real people, living real lives.The director, with an obviously limited budget, has taken a very deepsubject and, in my opinion, successfully portrayed the moments andsituations which arise through such a period in one's life.This film does not make you smile, it forces you to look at anotherlevel of this mortal coil...Not for everyone, as it requires an open mind and a minimum ofknowledge of one's feelings and thoughts.
