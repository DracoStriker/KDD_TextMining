I did not expect to like this movie as I had seen Enter the Void, andwas not impressed. But of course i love European cinema, and this moviereminded me of my love for European Cinema and Tragic Love Stories. Thestory may not be completely original and not different from so manypeople, but the feelings are real, so many can identify with this pain.Both characters had their issues. And a lot of misconception here isthat these characters don't love each other, because of the amount ofsex and with others. I find this movie very real very relatable to allof us. This movie very much reminded me of how you never stop lovingwho you once loved. And in reality you never know what you have untilits completely gone. Great scenes, great soundtrack, makes you feelwhat the character is going thru! Love it
