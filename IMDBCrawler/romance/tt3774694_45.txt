This film is overrated. It is nonsense nonsense , the perniciouswriting, children absurdly long dialogues and scenes that add nothing .Worst of Love is not that it is a bad movie, the trouble is that thereare people who think it's good . I love movies of this genre , but thisfilm is extremely boring and want to idealize the abuse, but in aboring way. The only thing I liked is photography, soundtrack andvisual effect.Personally I think the manager wanted to send a message but did notknow how to summarize this story is long and falls into theunnecessary. Do not understand how some people might like this kind offilm , I think they are visiting a lot tumblr. It is my humble opinion.
