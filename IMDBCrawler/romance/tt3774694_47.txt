'Love' by Gaspar Noe doesn't show what love is and still it is aboutlove. In fact, it is a strong warning. A young girl and a young manknow that they love each other and promise to care for each other butwhat they do destroys them and damages their love. Electra wants tocommit suicide (and might have done it), Murphy is lost and doesn'tknow what to do. There are no more them as they were when they met buttheir love is - wrecked, twisted, unable to shine it lives in theirhearts and in their memories.There's a scene in which Murphy says that what he would like is sexwith love. He knows the difference between casual sex and loving.Eroticscenes though too abundant in the film are beautiful. Finally the youngcouple realizes that they do harm to each other by satisfying his orher crazy wishes and decide to stay apart for some time. What abouttheir love? Do they care for it? Nothing of the kind. Each of themcares for oneself having sex or drugs nonchalantly. Love lost its home.Surprisingly enough but a truly loving relationship makes a triangle:you, me and Love. Is that the message of Gaspar Noe?
