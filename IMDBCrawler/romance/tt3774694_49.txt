I understand that my comments will come off as condescending but thereality is that after reading the negative user reviews, it is obviousthat the people who failed to enjoy the film are not sophisticated filmenthusiasts and likely just watched because they were looking for greatsex scenes. There is so much more substance to "Love" than sex. It is afilm about complex human personalities, regret, consequences and mostimportantly, the complexity of human emotions and impulses. I know fromthe first few scenes that Elektra was a damaged person. Noe did such afantastic job of getting the very best out of talent with limitedexperience. Perhaps that was the magic. A group of people who wanted totell a story and didn't come to the project with baggage or egos. Ifyou enjoy human stories and you are not uptight about the dark natureof the mind, "Love" is a must see.
