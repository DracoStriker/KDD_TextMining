I guess I fell for the marketing, and I have to admit the idea behindthe film still seems OK. The 3D effects were good & not overdone. Onthe other side: I found the script / plot to be thin, and the actingand voice overs were terrible. I got the idea this was a movie made byan American director who was trying to make a 'european' style moviebut didn't succeed. Afterwards I read the director is French (born insouth America).The movie lasts more than 2 hours, but there is no suspense, nobuildup, etc. Karl Glusman (the lead actor) is not credible in thisrole, the emotions don't seem real and his voice-overs are even worse.His character begin a 'movie director' or something of the kind seemsalmost irrelevant and implausible.After an hour, the movie started getting tedious as it was obvious this'wasn't going anywhere'. I don't recommend seeing it, unless you'reonly interested in the raw sex in 3D (but remember... it's more than 2hours you have to sit through).
