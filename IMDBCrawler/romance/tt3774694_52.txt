I think the director is really a frustrated porn aficionado but hasn'tgot the guts to ply his trade in the San Fernando Valley. Instead hewants to dress it up as a deep, introspective art form but he's a not agood enough director to pull that off.This is porn for all those who think they're above that sort of thing. The sheer length of the sex scenes (way beyond what is necessary toestablish the feeble gist of what scant plot there is) tells you allyou need to know.A CCTV camera in a college dormitory would produce a better film.Having said that, the filming and lighting is good for the most part sokudos to the technical team.
