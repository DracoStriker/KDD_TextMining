I waited a long time to see this movie and it totally fulfilled myexpectations. Noe has done it again; not in a violent, kind ofpsychedelic way but he has beautifully showed us how deeply connectedlove and sex are. I felt totally identified with many parts of themovie; aggressive after-fight sex, promises of eternal loyalty, thatdreamy state of mind that we are put on when we fall in love. Istrongly believe a director can transmit a message without giving usthe whole scenario. We don't know much about the main character'slives, but I felt like it wasn't necessary at all. What Noeaccomplished to show us are those profound feelings of despair, need,violence, tenderness and connection with another person. Thephotography is excellent, the colors are so beautiful and the music sowell chosen (and, a very important fact, selected/composed by JohnCarpenter) that in many scenes that show explicit sex you get botharoused and amazed. Enjoy this movie without prejudices, and remember,this is not Hollywood.
