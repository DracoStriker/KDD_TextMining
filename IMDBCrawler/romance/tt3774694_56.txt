This had potential - I like Gaspar Noe, I'm not easily shocked, Iappreciate risk-taking and sexual freedom in film and "Love" definitelyhad lots of both. Unfortunately, I echo what a lot of the other reviewshave said, that it needed a better script and a better male lead actor.The main female lead, Electra, outshone her male co-star to the pointwhere I was left thinking "Why so much trouble for this guy?". Hisacting felt forced, hollow, just...uninteresting. I actually think themovie could have even lost a bunch of dialogue and would have beenbetter...because the photography, cinematography, music and editing wasactually quite cool and kept it feeling alive...where the script was sopoor that it made me laugh at moments which I'm guessing was not theintention:)Anyway, I'd say worth checking out/experiencing, if only for the superhot sex scenes that make up about 50% of the movie!
