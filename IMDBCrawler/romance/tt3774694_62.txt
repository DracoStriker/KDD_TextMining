One of the greatest movies of all time! After "Irreversible" and "Enterthe Void", I thought director Gaspar Noe would have reached his peak. Ithought either that, or maybe he would have nothing left to show, butthis movie satisfies what the characters in the movie are looking for.Towards the end of the movie, one character bemoans the completeabsence of "sentimental sexuality" in cinema, and proposes to supplyit, and earlier, one of the characters challenges another: "Show me howgentle you can be." This movie is Noe's offering to that challenge.This movie continues in the recent history of French movies that seemto keep erasing the boundary between pornography and art. And yet thismovie seems to be one of a kind, thanks to how personal and vulnerableit seems. It seems to be a magnum opus, as do all of Noe's works.That's part of what makes them so thrilling to watch: they all have adistinct spirit of desperation infused in them, a hunger to be great.This movie seems to be ground-breaking in its camera-work, in its storystructure, in its handling of nudity and sex. And it's very beautiful.It soars where the latest movies of many formerly great auteurs seem tostrain and miss. The cinematography and editing are top-rate, and thereare no more devoted actors than these. The soundtrack alone deserves tohave a substantial essay written on it, the way it sounds 80s yetcontemporary yet futuristic, the way it sounds menacing yet romanticyet hip and yet like the soundtrack to a porno. Perfection!
