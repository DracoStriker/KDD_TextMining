There is love. There are good .rooming people, sex, yelling,abuse,ranting and swearing, but no love. The flimsy story is used topromote abortion and infidelity, selfishness and meanness. The actorsare used to advance classic leftist notions like if you eat meat youshould support aborting babies. This a very dull lecture interspersedwith unnecessary but well filmed sex.
