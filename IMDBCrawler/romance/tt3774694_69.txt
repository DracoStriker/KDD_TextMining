This is probably the most erotic film ever made.I didn't expect such anachievement from the director of Irreversible(a movie I hadn't liked atall).Oshima had tried to do something similar-and was given more creditto his effort than Noe-but I believe Love is better than The Empire ofsenses. It is filmed as a hard core movie, only with the exception thatit is about love and people who are in love and have sex all thetime;there are all kind of perplexities in the relations stemming allfrom the very nature of human feelings and human sexuality, but thefilm sticks to the theme of love in a way we have never experiencedagain in cinema.There is also a stylistic approach that reminded me ofKubrick(I do not think that it is irrelevant that the main malecharacter says that he chose to become a director because of 2001). Andlast but not least, in an extraordinary soundtrack you encounter- amongothers- the theme from John Carpenter's Assault on precinct 13 duringan orgy which can be considered the climax of the film(and I assureyou, as a die-hard Carpenter fan, there is nothing ridiculous aboutthat).So, the film may not be for everyone, but is a unique experiencethat does what others pose of doing, a perfect antidote for pretentiousrubbish-like The Lobster-and a romantic, sensual, original andtouching-if not a little too long in some parts- film that breaksthrough with more courage and devotion than the Warhol movies that itis referring to .A film about love in its purest form , about love asthe most rewarding and torturing experience of humans.And, of course,about loss as well.
