Having just come back from the UK Premier, I can honestly say, that wasquite simply appalling. Only Kill Your Friends is a worse film of 2015.I absolutely loved Enter the Void with a passion, the poster has beenmy iPhone screen saver ever since. It was slick, stylish, sexy andtrippy.Love, however fails to deliver on so many levels. I get what thedirector was trying to achieve here, but it just doesn't work due tothe appalling acting from the very unlikable main character. Where onearth did they get him from? Was he the only actor who was willing toshow his erect cock on the cinema screen? His lines are delivered withsuch a flat misanthropic moribund tone that you can't believe anythinghe says. The voice over just adds to the car crash. Its a film whichlacks any real emotion or chemistry.If you want to watch a gritty film with real emotions watch Blue is theWarmest Colour and 9 Songs. Caspar Noe, you have let us done badly here. Go back to making in yourface trippy films.
