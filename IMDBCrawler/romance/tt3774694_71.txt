If there is one thing that i can say with certainty about "Love" isthat I can safely recommend it to anyone that is interested in EroticCinema. Watch it at the theater, in 3D if possible."Love" is very much unlike any other film going experience that I haveever had, and I am not a stranger to films that show nudity and sex.Applying 3D to this picture was an excellent choice. It makes bothwatching the "action" and experiencing what is going through the maincharacter's mind more immersive.I have not seen such a powerful portrayal of a troubled young man since"Taxi Driver", one of my favorite movies."Electra", the main character's love interest, is also well written andacted. The depth of her character and her flaws are also deeply rootedin the story and its themes.There is a poster of "Taxi Driver" hanging on the wall of the room ofthe main character and I think that "Love", like "Taxi Driver", has thepotential to become a film that will be studied for the ages to come.The 3D was good but I think it could have been slightly better.The only negative aspect that I can think of are that the sex scenesdid occasionally become repetitive somewhere halfway, but onlysometimes.
