Now most people will not like this movie and I totally get it. I amfortunate enough to have seen it in 3D which I truly enjoyed dodgingseaman was quite interesting. But for me this movie was excellent. Thecast and acting was absolutely delicious. Like the Noe films I've seen,there are some great artistic shots and uncomfortable moments but Iwent in with those expectations and part of the joy is seeing how muchyou can endure watching. For me, what really caught my attention wasthe lead actor's emotional acting around heartbreak and regret, I knowthat feeling and I can almost feel his pain...the sex scenes becomesecondary after a while if you can find yourself connecting to theemotions of the story...and if you've watched enough unsimulated sex infilm as I have, it actually isn't quite a big deal. I think Noe didmake it his purpose to oversexualize the film a bit which at somepoints I found unnecessary but all and all, excellent film and just asgood if not better then Irreversible
