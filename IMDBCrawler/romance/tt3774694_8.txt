This film is literally a 90 minute porno hiding behind a 2 hour artfilm. Everything about it is bad. The editing is horrific, every singleshot is separated by a half second of a pure black screen. The scriptis bad. BAAAD. No one has anything resembling a likable personality,there is no plot, the dialogue is stupid at best. The acting... well,these people weren't hired for their acting talent. They were hiredbecause they were willing to get naked and have unsimulated sex onfilm. This film shows random sex scenes every chance it can. Also it'shomophobic and transphobic, there is a scene played totally for laughswhere the main guy freaks out over a transgendered woman. OH and ifyou're an epileptic, avoid this because the director seems to enjoygiving people seizures with random flashing lights.Literally the only thing about this that's in any way well done is thesex, and you can see better sex in actual porn films. Just go rent aporno, you'll get more enjoyment out of it and you won't have to dealwith this horribly made 'film'.
