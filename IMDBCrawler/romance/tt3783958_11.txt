While looking forward to seeing this film but having no realexpectations, the film was excruciatingly painful to sit through and Ilike musicals. Being a former film student,I found this film slow,boring, uneventful and at least an hour too long with unappealingcharacters. At a point in the film, Ryan Gosling's character looks outover L.A. and says "not much to look at". I said to my wife, "mythoughts exactly" (referring to the film-not L.A.). This made musicalslike 'Lost Horizon' and 'At Long Last Love' look like cinematicgreatness (and I enjoyed those). They certainly don't make them likethey used to.
