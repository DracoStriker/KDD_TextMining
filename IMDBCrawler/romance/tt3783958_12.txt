Tone of the movie wavers between serious and quirky, never making adefinitive choice; as such it succeeds at neither. Far too many"homages" to other movies to stand on its own. Tries to play on LAstereotypes, but the commentary on them only comes across as "makingsure each cliché is thrown in the movie somewhere," thereby ensuringthat the movie itself exemplifies the most prevalent LA stereotype:style over substance. Liked the "alternate reality" sequence if only for the fact that it wasthe one moment in the movie where it tried to say something interestingabout life and because I could pretend to be in some other realitywhere I wasn't watching this movie.
