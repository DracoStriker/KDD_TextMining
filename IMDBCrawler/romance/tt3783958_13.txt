Do I like musicals? Not really... but damn, 'La La Land' is anostalgic, colourful, joyful marvel!Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from hismasterful drama 'Whiplash', what were the chances that he could pulloff similar success two times in the row? Well, if 'La La Land' isanything to go by, then I'd say he did the job. With just three filmsunder his belt as of 2016, Chazelle is slowly becoming the next bigthing this movie industry has seen. His passion for classic movies andmusicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from filmslike 'Singin' in the Rain', 'The Umbrellas of Cherborg' and even 'RebelWithout a Cause', the latter of which is one of my favourite films soseeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about.The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least,after two previous collaborations, their already-strong bond helpedthem become one of modern-day cinema's finest couples. The music isbouncy and toe-tapping catchy, the cinematography is utterly stunningwith gorgeous colours and impressive long takes, and the locations sumup the American dream and the passion the characters hold for LosAngeles. 'La La Land' is by far one of the finest cinema experiences Ihave had in the past 5-10 years, and although this isn't a film I wouldtypically enjoy (genre-wise), Chazelle has instead crafted one of myfavourite films of this decade. A film I would recommend everyone seein the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic.
