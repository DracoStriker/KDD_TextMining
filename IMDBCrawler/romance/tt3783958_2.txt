I love musicals, but I must have missed the stand in the theater wherethey were handing our the kool-aid for this one. Based on the hype, I had high expectations. I went in thinking "La LaLand" would be like "An American in Paris" or "The Bandwagon," but onceit started I realized it was more like "One From the Heart," or"Everyone Says I Love You," although both of those dismal failures hadbetter music. In this film, Ryan Gosling plays a supercilious piano-playing bore whoendlessly pontificates about "jazz." Emma Stone plays his vapid loveinterest, a star-struck barista who thinks she should be a movie starbecause she has a home filled with movie posters and her aunt onceshowed her "Casablanca." Once these two ciphers meet, the audience issubjected the kind of dreary conversation one flees from in real life.The musical score is deeply uninteresting. Emma and Ryan's hilltopdance is supposed to be reminiscent of Fred Astaire and CydCharisse/Ginger Rogers, but comes closer to Teri Garr and Raul Julia inthe aforementioned Coppola disaster. By the way, the film completely fails to capture L.A. in any way.Kudos to Emma and Ryan for trying to sing and dance, unfortunatelyproving that it takes MORE talent than they or most other Hollywoodcelebrities have to perform in a musical. However, I think that DamienChazelle should be prevented from ever making another film musical. If you insist on subjecting yourself to an excruciatingly bad musical,try "The Apple," which is a lot more fun and has better music. To checkout good-to-great musicals, see the movies that "inspired" La LaLand--the RKO Fred & Ginger movies and the MGM musicals from the 30'sthrough 50"s. Even the recent straight-to-video "Lucky Stiff" leaves"La La Land" in the dust.
