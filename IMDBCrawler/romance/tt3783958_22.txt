I'm sorry but I just don't get the adulation for this very bland, veryboring musical. I watched it with a lot of anticipation with my partnerand both she and I were bored enough to consider giving up.The opening sequence was like a James Bond opening sequence. It hadnothing to do with the actual film and was the best part.I'm a very big musical fan and it's difficult to think of one I haven'tseen. This one has an original score and isn't a film version of aBroadway musical so should not be compared too closely to films likeMamma Mia or Les Miserables but can be compared to Singing in The Rain,High Society and to a certain extent Sound of Music, My Fair Lady,Cabaret, etc., which were produced in an age where Theatregoing was arich persons pastime.In every comparison, this film fails. The music is insipid and totallyforgettable. The acting is OK but the main characters dancing would nothave got them past week two of Strictly Come Dancing. The biggest fault with the movie is the complete lack of supportingactors to flesh out the story. The two main characters are just notstrong enough to carry the movie for more than two hours without help.I'm talking about actors like Anne Hathaway (Les Mis.), Joel Grey(Cabaret), Stockard Channing (Grease), George Chakiris (West SideStory), Donald O'Conner (Singing In The Rain). The list goes on and on.In this film all we got were cameos by John Legend and a totally wastedJ K Simmons (would love to have seen him sing and dance!!).So! Sorry for being a spoilsport but I just cannot see what all thefuss is about
