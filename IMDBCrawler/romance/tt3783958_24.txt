Bottom-line: Once upon a time there was the American musical whichcould inspire the world by wielding great visuals, music, story andcharacters. Today we have the perfect lobotomy instrument called La LaLand. I began theorizing that it would only be possible to understand thepraise and delight of the general populace if lobotomy would have beenperformed on a universal scale. I know not of any such undertaking andI'm no fan of conspiracy theories. Alas, I have to assume that thereare shortcomings of mine which do not let me enjoy this so called jewelof a movie which purportedly restores the glamour of the Golden Era ofHollywood.Plus points: 1) Pretty Emma Stone, who can actMinus points: 1) Emma Stone can't sing, 2) Emma Stone can't dance toowell, 3) Ryan Gosling can't sing or dance, 4) Weak plot delivered in aunbelievable manner, 5) Silly and overused musical score, 6)Uninteresting dialogue, 7) No character depth and actually no chemistrybetween the two protagonists. Overall feel to the movie was that of silliness beyond measure. Mypersonal reaction was that of uncontrolled, roaring laughter. It isstrange indeed that while I cried at the "funny" moments, I laughed atthe "sad" and "serious" moments. I have to admit that rarely have Ilaughed this way during a movie. The ratings and nominations areoftentimes so unfair to real cinematic talent that I had to give a 1(one) mark for the balance. It is really sad that the Renaissance ofthe American musical is trumpeted by this hollow shell of a movie.
