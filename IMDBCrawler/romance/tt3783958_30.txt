I've never been more disappointed in a film than I have with La LaLand. The trailer had me completely sucked in and I couldn't wait tosee it at the cinema. However, this film is an hour too long, hadpractically no story and was so boring to watch, my Mom was asleepafter 10 minutes. Not just that but all the 'singers' in the film werefar too weak, Gosling and Stone didn't have powerful enough voices tocarry off the lead parts. John Legend had the best voice by far, buthis part was so small it didn't make a difference to the film as awhole. Not good at all, if you do go to see this, don't believe all thehype and go in with low expectations.8.8 on IMDb, what a joke!
