When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were sethigh. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writerwere enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when itcomes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Notin this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic andloving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LAand worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of thisfilm's endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyonewho's ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true lovewill also easily connect with this film's gargantuan heart. I'm a selfproclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see,but La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend thisfilm enough. It's the kind of film you leave and you don't want thebuzz, the tickle, the movie-high to end. I can't wait to see it againwhen it's in wide release. The artist in me is inspired again.
