I went to see this movie only because of all the Oscar nominations, butwhen it turned out to be so cheesy that I would send it back if it wasa pizza I'd ordered, I read the fan reviews, hoping somebody wouldexplain what I had missed. None do, but I've learned something I hadnot wanted to know about IMDb reviews. Musicals like Annie and Greaseunderstood that there needs to be a plot line between the songs, andsome songs should be decent enough to not need a movie to sell them.Unfortunately, La La Land was only created to prove Mel Gibson'sparanoia about Hollywood correct. The racist screenwriters wanted toensure we all knew that they thought the teacher in the movie DangerousMinds was too nice (they hammer on this twice in the movie). They thentry to hide their racism behind portrayal of the main character havingblack friends and liking jazz, but only long enough to end the moviewith a drawn out scene about this same character deciding he was wrongabout those choices and regretting that he ever made any black friends.Somehow, Hollywood's elite thought this message was more important thanreminding Americans about a forgotten war hero who singlehandedly savednearly a hundred American lives on the battlefield in WWII, or the truestory of an Indian boy's struggles to find his family.
