OK it is a 6ish Movie. But Look at the ratings. The rating totallymisleads the audiences and I don't think a good movie maker should dothat. If you want to make a 9-star movie. Make it not fake it.The movie has the unbelievable boring start and this lasts for 2/3 ofthe movie. The whole movie hardly has any story so don't expect anyamazing story or something, there is none. Just couple fall in love hadone fight and separates. The movie deserves a 6 because it is reallygood at sharing the lovers' feelings. But one good thing doesn't makeit a 9 star for sure.Please do not cheat the audiences.
