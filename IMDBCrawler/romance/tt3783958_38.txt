I have an eclectic taste in films, so am not averse to a "good" musical- especially with impressive dance routines. West Side Story is one ofmy favourites, with brilliant songs, choreography and a powerful story.Mama Mia was superbly acted and sung and loads of fun. But Lala Land isso stale, dated and tacky! OK so there are some talented performers init but the story line is shallow and trite and the music is so dated -they deserved a much better script than this! It might be considered tobe a tribute to Old Style Hollywood by some but Singing in the Rain itain't! It's not even close to that standard. I was bitterlydisappointed and have no idea why it has won so many awards. I trulyregret the time and money I spent going to see it!
