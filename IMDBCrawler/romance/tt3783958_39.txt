Sorry, I had to give it a 1 to counter the people who gave this a 10.My wife and I went to see this movie based on ratings. It isn't reallya very good anything. It had no memorable songs. It didn't have anysingers to mention. Sorry, the main actors are not singers.The drama part may have been the best where we find that following yourdream takes away from REAL people and real relationships so in that wayit was sad, so sad.Calling this a comedy is wrong. Only once in the theater did I hearothers laughing and that was only for a brief moment. Maybe is was thekind of people in the audience. My wife and I were talking about whereis PeeWee Herman and the two guys in front of us told us to shushduring where Ryan was whistling on the pier. Really? Did we take awayfrom the whistle sound track that much guys? Don't think I missed thetwo times the piano was not played correctly either. However one of thegrand's was nicely tuned. That may have been the best part of themovie. You got to hear the difference between a real piano and anelectronic one. The real is always better as is real relationships arealways better than following your own desires.
