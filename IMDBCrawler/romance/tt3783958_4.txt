Writer/Director Damien Chazelle, who already had a nice career goingfor him, explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful, mesmerizing,and completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown.The opening sequence (satirized on the Golden Globes) really does notdo the rest of the film justice. It is as if the cast from the FAMEremake grew up, had children of their own, and then those childrenhijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash-mob dancesequence.From that point on, the film is hypnotic.We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas ofthe 1940s. If the film had been in B&W, you would almost have expectedto see Bette Davis in a 3-hankie tear jerker.Except for the musical interludes, of course, which are pitch perfectand totally wonderful.Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance,but he delivers the goods. Stone, who was supposed to be "the next big thing" after Easy A (2010),steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well. Theawards should flow like water, and she will deserve every one.As I said, deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood. The filmindustry has always had issues with endings -- back in the day theywould film several different endings per picture -- and then decide atthe last minute which to use. Here Chazelle pays homage to that bygiving us an alternate ending, along with the "real" ending, along witha closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing inHollywood is actually real, but everything still can be really fun.Destined to be a classic. Recommended.
