This movie won awards and praised by some, so the chances are that youare going to see it eventually...As a musical it lacks good music and good choreography. It drawsinspiration by classics like Singing in the rain and West Side Storybut it can't compete with any of these masterpieces and it doesn'toffer anything new in the genre.In terms of acting Emma Stone is very good, showing seamlesstransitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from RyanGosling who adds to the sad tone that the movie will eventually reach.The plot it starts as a satire of todays (and past and maybe future)Los Angeles, which is full of waitresses who want to be famousactresses and struggling musicians who have their own dreams to make itin a very competitive world.Later it becomes a romantic story (not only for relationships but alsofor dreams and wishes) but in its final act the movie takes a seriousdramatic turn where the two "happy" endings are combining to adepressing conclusion, that even the final two reassuring nods can'trepair. Add to this an alternate timeline flashback that thedirector/writer wanted to incorporate to his vision, and you end upwith an overall depressing movie that actually ruins the optimisticfeeling and the romance that initially had.Overall: Depressing. Mediocre forgettable music. A classic story thatends up in a melancholic, yet pragmatical, way..
