I really wanted to like this movie... It had so much potential but it'sa lack of everything it wanted to be... First, I like both actors, Ireally do..But I don't think they did justice to dancing or singing.Itsimply didn't look real or serious enough.Either they're not talentedenough or they should've work harder and longer for it...I'm not aprofessional dancer but you can see from the sky that the way they movetheir feet isn't real dancers alike! Idea of bringing old Hollywoodstyle, step dancing and singing is brilliant but there is no muchstory..Scenario is somehow cheap.John Legend I love your music..Butcasting him was more desperate than necessary..The buzz over this movieis just so over-hyped, they're even mentioning Oscar nominations whichit obviously doesn't deserve..You simply can't put this next toTitanic,The Lord of the rings or I don't know... Brave Heart orGladiator category...It takes a better story.It needs to be moreoriginal,more breathtaking..It needs to to give you goosebumps and besomething to remember! There isn't much to tell about this movie,causeeven tho it wanted , this movie simply doesn't give enough! I'm sorrybut it's six from me!
