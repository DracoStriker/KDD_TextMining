What are they thinking? How is it possible that this crap movie got 14( ! ) Oscar nominations ? Did they really see it? It is bad from thebeginning to the end. Saccharine-style and no substance. You see bettermusical numbers in commercials. The opening number was cringe worthyand then it got even worse. The singing and dancing is absolutelyawful. The storytelling is so poor and predictable. It is an insult tothe intelligence of every three year old. And even worse; the movie isso terribly terribly boring. ( I should have been warned althoughbecause the over-hyped movie Whiplash of the same director bored mealmost to death before... ) .The only reason I did not leave the cinemawas the beautiful and charming Emma Stone. Even she could not rescuethis wreck of a movie. In the end it was a bitter disappointment. Isthis the best what we can expect from Hollywood ? It is the perfectfilm for the Trump era. Thumb, hollow and a big nothing. Lets hope thisera is short!
