This piece of garbage actually exists! Like how did this get a BestPicture nomination for hole Finding Dory did not? This fathoms me.The songs in this film are so pretentious and boring and I checked mywatch every five milliseconds, thinking about how I could be watchingFinding Nemo or Finding Dory for the 576th time. The songs are just sobad, much worse than quality music like "Just sleep Swimming" fromFinding Nemo, a beautifully written melodramatic piece of awesomeness.The music here is awful and nowhere near that level of musical power.If the two leads were played by Albert Brooks and Ellen Degeneres,maybe it would have been an OK movie but they are played by otheractors who are very bad. Their clothes were ugly too. The costumedesign in Finding Nemo is much better.Avoid at all costs! Finding Nemo is better!!!
