I usually don't write reviews, but i felt in this case I had to. Havingseen so many reviews and people raging about how wonderful this filmis, I truly hate to say it, but oh how wrong they are. Firstly, asactors and people I enjoy Ryan and Emma's work, I think they are bothincredibly talented and work well together. However, their styles andtalents were not suitable for this movie, this was a musical-I wouldexpect the actors to be better than sub-par singers. The dancingelement, albeit abrupt and highly unnecessary in many cases, was welldone, the routines were quite abstract and I enjoyed them. The storyline was nothing more than predictable and in the end ratherdisappointing. I saw this movie with friends and the only reason why wedidn't walk out was simply out of worry that one of us was enjoying it.(We weren't). There are no words I can use to recommend you to see thisfilm - as I would be lying if I did.Please don't waste your money - It is a cross between a low budget MamaMia, and a rather terrible Hallmark movie.
