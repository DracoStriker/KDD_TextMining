I went to this movie with reasonable, but not overly high expectations,and in the end it was a pleasant enough time. But to suggest this is agreat movie is astonishing!It is a musical that looks back nostalgically to earlier greatmusicals. But the leads can't sing, can't dance, can act a little!(pardon the reference - it seemed in keeping)Equally bad, there are no songs of any worth in the whole movie.The lead actor is a jazz purist who is willing to put put his life inturmoil to live out his dream of playing real jazz. Instead, everyonearound him plays excellent jazz, and he plays nothing but a veryundernourished pop song.On a positive note, the opening scene was a gas. Superficial, yes, butreally fun and impressive with its long tracking shot. It gave me hopefor the rest of the movie, but that was the end of anything of anyworth.The complete split of opinion between this being a great movie, and itbeing a very ordinary one is bizarre. Best Picture? Really? Have peoplenot been going to anything else this year. There have been someabsolutely wonderful movies this year.I do not understand at all. Perhaps it is because I love musicals andwatch them a lot that I have something to compare it to. I don't know.But I have never been more confused.
