Saying that this film is a Musical is like saying The Martian is acomedy. I found the film extremely slow moving and it did not hold myattention. The story line was weak and it had me hoping it wouldimprove. It did not improve and I walked out with about 40 minutes ofthe film remaining. Considering the exceptional reviews and ratingsthis film has been getting I was sorely disappointed. Films likeSinging in the Rain are musicals. This is not even a fraction of amusical. I am an avid film goer and consider that I have enough musicalknowledge, coming from a musical background, to give such judgments. Inotice one other reviewer stated this could be classed as a poor man'sWoody Allen film and I totally agree. Last year I saw The Cafe Societyand this had far greater costumes, acting, depth and music .
