My summary basically says it all. I had so been looking forward toseeing this movie particularly as l love musicals - but am sad to saythat I was hugely disappointed. It started brightly enough with thetraffic jam dance scene - but from there on in it was all downhill forme. I felt the whole film was terribly disjointed and it felt like theywere trying too hard to recreate the magical musicals of years gone by.The singing was poor - and the 'dancing' - if you could call it that -equally uninspiring. Some reviewers have even gushed about this beingone of the 'greatest musicals' of all-time. What?? Have they never seenWest Side Story, Grease, or any of the old Hollywood greats? Obviouslyno, otherwise they would never have made such a stupid statement. Forme this was 2 hours of ZZzzzzz.
