I wasn't' expecting much from this movie but to my surprise, it waseven worst than I would've imagined!I mean musicals aren't really mytype of movie but still... and don't even get me started on the actingI mean... Let's just say that if Emma Stone wins an Oscar I will notlonger respect the academy. I've seen better acting in TV commercials!It was so bad that I felt that I was watching an actor playing acharacter playing another character (and not in a well down way). Also,the way that the story was told it was really hard to connect with thecharacters and the somewhat romantic story of the movie. I think thatthe story had potential and it could've been a great movie it was justbad casting and too much musical, they should've toned down a little.
