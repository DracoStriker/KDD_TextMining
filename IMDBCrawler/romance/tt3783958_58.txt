This flat, poorly scripted movie clearly draws from (read copied) "WestSide Story", Singing in the Rain", "Funny Face" (the balloons), "MoulinRouge", "Top Hat" and actually succeeds in failing. We even hear Kermitthe Frog's Rainbow Connection in Emma's song about her aunt.When the screen said "Five Years Later" I sighed with relief. Thank GodI did not have to sit for five years in front of this disaster! I canwrite a better script than that, many can. And with all those moviesthe writer/director copied from, he should have delivered a productthat was at least watchable. Not an Oscar contender at all! Don't wasteyour time or your money.
