I must be missing something here. I went to see this expectingsomething fantastic given that it had 14 Oscar nominations - includingBest Actor and Best Actress. I left feeling very disappointed andwondering what all the hype was about.A song and dance movie, with stars that could neither sing nor dance.How does that work? The answer is very plain - it doesn't. The bestdancing in the film was the one where the dancers were in silhouette.There was a nice flowing movement to it and the two dancers movedgracefully. This was meant to be the two leads dancing, but I suspectthat this dance was performed by 'proper' dancers - it was so differentis class from the dances where Gosling and Stone were visible.With competent performers, it might not have been half as bad - but Istill don't think it would warrant all the accolades it has been given.The story was a bit predictable, and the whole film about 20 minutestoo long.
