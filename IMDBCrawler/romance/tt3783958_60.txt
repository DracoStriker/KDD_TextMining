After rave reviews and the Golden Globes there's now an Oscar/Baftabuzz attached to LA :LA LAND. Sorry to rain on the big parade but I wasnot blown away. Yes, there's some charm here with all the homage to theGolden Age of romantic musicals, and Ryan Gosling remains the mostcharismatic of today's young stars, but the music simply isn't musicalenough. Gosling and Emma Stone can just about carry a song and do a bitof amateur hoofing, but really the singing is nearly as ragged as itwas in the screen version of LES MISERABLES and the dancing is about asfar from Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly as the first round of 'DancingWith the Stars'.OK, Kelly and Astaire (and Ginger Rogers and other co-stars of theirs)did not have great singing voices, but they were fantastic dancers andthe song-and-dance numbers in their movies were never less thandazzling. The closest LA LA LAND comes to dazzling is in the finalroutine, a low-rent tribute to AN American IN Paris, but it justdoesn't have enough dazzle. As musicals go, fings ain't what they usedto be. The jazz club scenes hit the only high spots. Gosling really looks asif he's creating magic on the piano, but there's no magic in hissinging or his dancing ? nor in Stone's, who alas doesn't have herco-star's redeeming charisma. The love-story has a certain amount ofcharm but, like the music, it could do with a bit more 'zing'.The Golden Age nostalgia also extends to a clunky tribute to REBELWITHOUT A CAUSE. But nostalgia just isn't enough and there's too muchclunkiness on display here. They say there isn't the money to creategreat musicals like we had in MGM's heyday. Surely it would take only afraction of the budget for a CGI-heavy action movie or space opera tohire some first-rate dancers and singers who can act - or, if we must,actors who can sing (or mime to a better singer)? SINGIN' IN THE RAINcannot have been a big-budget production, but it's still the greatestof the greats.
