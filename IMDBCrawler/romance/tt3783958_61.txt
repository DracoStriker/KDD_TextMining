To boot, I loved almost all the separate components of the filmindividually but I didn't love the resulting bundle.Aesthetically, my eyes were gently caressed with beauty for the fullduration of the movie and for that I'm most appreciative.Ryan Gosling is his usual, immaculate self, succeeding in gracing uswith yet another stunning performance -- stylish, suave and utterlycharming.Emma Stone has her ups and middles but never a down, and she gave meone of the sole two scenes that made my breathing falter against anemotional hiccup; another win.Now, on the musical side of things...Meh.The songs left me disinterested, the overall sound dress of the filmrang uninspired and repetitive, only resonating with my pathos during acouple of instances, while the rest lagged tiredly to the request ofthe more instinct-driven scenes.The story itself... a bit silly, no? Simplistic almost, benefiting froma strong start, a fantastic ending and the sparking chemistry betweenthe protagonists, on the other hand, lacking any sort of actualsubstance past the forced demand to fall head over heels with thekitty- cuteness that we are being presented, no questions asked. Idon't like having my arm twisted into feeling, and this is where thisotherwise whimsical tale of sensory affluence hit another miss for me.To sum up. I acknowledge the individuality of the project, felt thestrive and artistry that is so craftily weaved into the seams of thisaudiovisual extravaganza and I was, without a doubt, entertained. Onthe flip side, the way it all translated to my reason, the shortcomingsof La La Land make this a middle-tier effort, only edging ahead onaccount of the fact that along with the glossy couple, I got to glidewith effortless elegance through a Starry Night, brush shoulders withMonet, journey into the colourful and the capricious.For that fact, I will accept defeat, bump it up another star and humblytake off my fedora to it.
