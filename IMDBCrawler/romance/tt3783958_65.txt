This film starts with a great promise. We follow a musician and anaspiring actress who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles. The film'stitle is a reference both to a nickname for the city of Los Angeles andto the idiom for being out of touch with reality. But where it fails itall the rest. The movie is well acted no doubt, but the subject, youcare less and less. And even if you want to, this film is a 90 minutesromantic comedy that turns out to be 130... even Woody Allen will thinkit's too much, i want the shorter version. I was bored to death and i'ma huge fan of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Work... here I try, but can't! It's just too long !
