Telluride by the Sea (Portsmouth, NH) led off its 2016 weekend filmfestival with La La Land, a captivating film that hearkens back to thegolden age of Hollywood cinema yet remains firmly embedded inpresent-day Los Angeles life. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring astartling depth and nuanced feelings to what could easily have beenanother trite variation on the theme of falling in and out of love. Thefilm impressed me on so many levels, for the quality of the directionand cinematography, the seamless transition between musicalsong-and-dance numbers with a powerful narrative, the inventivechoreography, the authenticity that Stone and Gosling brought to theirportrayal of their characters, and the amplification of the intensityof their romance enacted through their singing and dancing. This filmis not-to-be-missed by anyone who loves the classic Ginger Rodgers-FredAstaire movies and who longs for a modern re- invention of this genre.
