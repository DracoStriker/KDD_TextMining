Well done the marketing department for creating a buzz around thisfilm. The first comments I read in the newspapers said this was anuplifting life affirming experience. So how come my husband and I leftthe cinema feeling thoroughly depressed with the ending. The film wasslow, boring and didn't have much to say. The opening sequence lookedpromising but turned out to be an unconnected piece of entertainmentthat wasn't repeated in the movie. It was left to Stone and Gosling tostumble along with short bits of dancing and very shaky vocals. Didn'tdetect any magical reaction from the audience who shuffled out insilence. Don't believe the hype this is a just OK film probably a 5.4rating would be nearer the truth.
