I'm sorry but Gosling's singing was atrocious. Unfortunately, he wasn'tthe only person in this movie whose singing was not good enough for amusical production. Right from the opening scene you are confrontedwith actors who wouldn't make it past the first casting round of aBroadway show. Don't get me wrong....I like Emma Stone but she doesn't fit the role of"young, aspiring actress" anymore which makes her something of amiscast. The story is plain boring and the dialogue is bland. Who wantsto see Gosling agonizing about the nature of Jazz music in long scenesdrawn out like old chewing gum followed by semi-neurotic "love interestscenes" which seem to pass for convincing romance these days? I guesstwo people who qualify for couples' therapy sessions after just havingmet is the new normal. The cinematography is great and the director really knows how to"paint" moving pictures but it's all form and no substance making itthe musical equivalent of a Michael Bay action movie. In my opinionthis is one of the most over-hyped and overrated movies in many years.
