I cannot remember being so bored in a theater. My wife, who lovesromances, told me later she considered leaving after the first 30minutes. Which is sad, because there are many good elements in the filmand the story line, though thin, could have given us more reason forcaring about the characters. Two young struggling artists meet, fall inlove, but choose fame over love. Okay. Except there was no struggle.Unlike the thousands of people who do struggle to live a life in art,these two must have had trust funds. Every sequence that could havegiven the characters more depth was swept away in a song. Which bringsme to the other problem. Great musicals have great songs, but the filmhad none (though the jazz scenes were very entertaining). The film didattain a level of excellence in the final scene sequence - a wistfulmusical imagining of what could have been. If the film as a whole couldhave reached this level, it would have been an excellent musical.Unfortunately it took an hour and a half before the film createdsufficient context for the music and dance to have this level ofrelevance. Perhaps the film's popularity can be accounted for byunfamiliarity with the genre. Music Man or Cabaret it was not.
