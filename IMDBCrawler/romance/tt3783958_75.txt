In a word: turgid. Given the hype, I had expected an up-beat colourful,all-singing & dancing romp. Boy, was I disappointed! Save your moneyand take your loved one for a couple of beers instead.The opening traffic jam song-dance sequence was a nigh-onunintelligible uninspiring mess that added pointless minutes to whatturned out in any case to be an over-long film. From there on we limpthough a lacklustre passionless "romance" until we reach an ambiguousending. There are a couple of cute songs along the way. The dancing isdisappointing, especially if you're thinking of something along thelines of Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers. Ironically the high spot for me was the sequence where Ryan Gosling'scharacter is playing keyboards in a pop band, something that conflictswith his jazz-based musical values. Gosling's character seemed mildly depressed throughout. which is notappealing. And although Stone can act convincingly, there's a limit tohow much big eyed gazing I can take. When good films end, an audience will be buzzing with conversation,with smiles on faces. This one ended with silent shuffling. There was apalpable sense of disappointment. Did wives feel guilty for draggingtheir husbands to such a turkey? And did husbands fume at losing 2hours of their lives, which could have been spent watching "Homes underthe hammer" on TV?
