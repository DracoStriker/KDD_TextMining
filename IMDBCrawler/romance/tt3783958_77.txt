SPOILER ALERT This review details the end of the film so best avoideduntil after viewing (or not bothering to view) the film.The problem with La La Land, as I see it, is exactly the same asArrival.I spent a couple of hours getting into the film, only to discover thatthe ending made the rest of the film completely irrelevant, which sortof abuses my trust in spending money and time on the picture.In all honesty, who would make a film about their relationship withtheir EX? Most people have a past love who went on to happily marrysomeone-else. Would you really want to celebrate that fact in film? Idon't think so.I left the cinema thinking that Sebastian had thrown away the bestthing that ever happened to him. A reason to celebrate? I don't thinkso.Also, five years later Mia has met, courted and married someone-elseand had a baby who looked two years old. She can't have missedSebastian that much then as she was supposedly spending the first ofthose five years making and publicizing a film. That gave her just overa further year before getting pregnant for nine months. Hmmm."10 years later" would have been more realistic.All in all, a well made film but a waste of my time, money andemotional investment in the characters.
