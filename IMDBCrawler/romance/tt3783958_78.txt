Nothing good but the cinematography. The story is so dull, I don't knowhow this has a high rating. After the way too long opening song, I wasbored already. It did not get better. I would not waste your time unless you love musicals so much that thelack of engaging plot or characters, will not bother you. Or you justwant to see if for the cinematography, that was great. I like both ofthese actors but I don't see how they got awards for these roles, justbecause they danced and sang?? This was definitely hyped by the right people, but there is not muchthere.Ryan's piano playing was splendid, tho.
