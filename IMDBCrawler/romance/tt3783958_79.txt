The story is as thin as it is simple-minded and totally banal. Themovie would likely be a total flop without the two main actors - andwithout the giant hype and marketing campaign that has obviously beenunleashed. The soundtrack is largely uninspiring. The dancing andsinging of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is OK, but far from exceptionalor ground-braking. I have no idea how anyone could spot magic orauthenticity in this highly superficial, totally overrated movie. Theonly really authentic about this over-hyped piece is, that it is a truereflection of today's Hollywood: self-absorbed, totally superficial,full of hypocrisy and unable to even consider any other view than thatof their own echo chamber. There are, obviously and luckily, somenotable exceptions to this among the myriad Hollywood stars andstarlets, but they are far and few between. It says a lot about theGolden Globes that they have been awarded in bulk to this movie. Maybethe competition was even worse? If this film gets Oscars as manypredict, it will simply be fitting. After all, a Hollywood in theircastles and mansions being totally detached from reality, from the lifeof ordinary people in this world, from ground realities, they willlikely love what they see here. Even though it is just praising andcelebrating its own echo chamber. This movie is Hollywood-narcissism atits worst. Oh, and btw: these are the same people who mock Trump forhis narcissism? Go figure!
