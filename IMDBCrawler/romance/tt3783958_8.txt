Wow, I just cannot believe all the accolades this movie is getting. Theonly reason why it must be getting all these awards is that is is amovie about Hollywood, and Hollywood loves itself very much. The actingis vapid, the dancing mediocre, the songs forgettable, the singingabysmal. Everyone sounds like a bad choir audition-- weak, breathy,without focus or "ring". No legit Broadway-style singing technique. Icannot imagine what real Broadway singers and dancers must be thinkingabout this travesty.I think it must be an exercise in navel-gazing, as the awards bodiessee themselves in these two characters. Haven't they all struggled toget auditions? Haven't they all had screen tests? Haven't they alltried to "make it" in Hollywood? of course they have. The awards giverslike looking at themselves in the mirror. Personally I do not like whatthey see. Don't bother wasting your energy, or you will quit halfwaythrough, as I did. 0 out of 10.
