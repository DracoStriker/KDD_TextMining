Not written a review for a while but this overrated bore fest promptedme to warn others. Honestly I haven't been so bored in a long time, itsway too long, hardly any dialogue and hardly any singing to push thestory forward. The story really isn't interesting either and therelationship that develops in it is just isn't believable a couple ofconversations and a dance together and suddenly they are a couple andwe are supposed to care!? I haven't paid to watch a film in a long timebut took the wife because she heard it was amazing but even she screwedher nose up at the end and she loves musicals. Pearce Brosnan singingin Mama Mia was more entertaining than this entire film.
