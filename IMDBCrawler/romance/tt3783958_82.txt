Positively one of the worst movies, never mind musicals that I haveever watched in my entire life and I am now almost 64.I am not only amazed at the mediocrity of the movie but also by theresponse from those movie goers who see fit to rate this production as10 star.One reviewer suggested that it was the best movie they had seen sinceStar Wars when they were a kid. What planet is this reviewer now livingon? He/she could not possibly have seen the same movie that I enduredjust a few hours ago. It lacked story-line, pace, memorable songs. It had one simplistictune, melody or whatever which was constantly repetitive. Thecharacters lacked depth and credibility. And the actors were poor inthe art of song and dance. The backdrops and sfx were abominable and B-movie like in execution.If this movie succeeds at the Oscars, it is further proof of how out oftouch America is with the rest of the world in both politics and thearts. The only saving grace is that neither can get much worse and that inthe spirit of hope great things will arise from the ashes.
