I am usually mistrustful of over-hyped movies but, on this occasion, Iwas in the mood for a feel good musical with an upbeat message - notsomething I am usually drawn to. The Sunday Times reviewer said that"Hating La La Land is like hating a puppy" and gave it 4 stars. Well Ilike puppies very much but this movie was a massive disappointment. Badsinging; bad dancing; and a mediocre script, made this movie, in myopinion one of the worst movies of the last 12 months. How this can beconsidered as Oscar material is beyond me but then clearly I am in aminority - although judging by many of the reviews on here - not thatsmall a minority. The second half, in my opinion, was better than thefirst half. And, yes I did get most of the symbolism and the attemptsat pastiche and various homages to the past. This definitely won't beon my 'best of' list.
