What an awful movie. Are the rating a joke? The movie cinematographywas so tight and out of balance that it was disturbing. Talking headsthat themselves get cropped off from time to time. People bumping intothe edge of the screen or looking off the screen. It was out of balanceand dizzying as they panned between the characters.Then the story is supposed to be about love but ends up being aboutnarcissism. Achieving maximum career success is better than true love.In the real world love is about compromise and working towards mutualsuccess. Of course this movie is about Los Angeles and Hollywood somaybe that is the way it works there looking at the divorce rate forcelebrities. But this is not the reality that exist in the other 99% ofthe country so I do not get the appeal of this movie.I did bump the rating to 2 because there is a good scene with JohnLegend singing in a night club.
