This is a film for those who like predictable and corny song and danceromance plots. I saw the high rating and, since I love Emma Stone andRyan Gosling, I had high hopes for this flick, but . . . alas . . .Icouldn't even stomach it after the first 15 or so minutes and gave up.I'm surprised I lasted that long. What a crashing bore.West Side Story or Oklahoma this ain't. I live in CA and resent thefact that this film tries to transport its inferior East Coastlet's-dance-our-way-down-Broadway type schlock to our sandy shores.I honestly got the feeling that while Emma was enjoying her stint as asinging dancing out of work actress, Ryan was a complete fish out ofwater. Bless him for trying----I guess.There must have been a lot of theater goers who loved this film. Itjust goes to show that de gustibus non est disputandum. There is noaccounting for taste.
