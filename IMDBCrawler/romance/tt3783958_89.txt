I see the universal adulation this film has had, and there's much toadmire. To my ears, though, it's sadly lacking in the one key elementevery musical needs: great songs. With the possible exception of"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)," there's not a memorable tune orsoaring line to be found. It doesn't help that neither of the two leadshas a strong singing voice, and as for dancing -- the steps arelimited, and even within that scope, not particularly well-executed.Dancing, in a musical, has to be over-the-top good to carry the energyof the film.But the worst thing, really, is the lack of structure. Musicals areselective in the parts of the story that they take to build thethree-act structure; the characters have to be established before wecan care about them, have to face an obstacle so that we care more, andhave to overcome it or die trying, at which point the big numbers comeout. Here, we start with a big number -- the dance on the LA freeway --but there's no reason for dancing as of yet. The love-not-at-first-sight motif is a good old one, but here it's so choppilypresented that we're not sure whether we should care or not. It couldbe a slow-motion screwball comedy, or a musical revue punctuated bylittle life-dramas -- but to be a musical it must soar. This one isleaden, forced, and was painful for me to watch, despite much admirableproduction work and cinematography. After I got home, I watched "Singin' in the Rain" as an antidote, andfelt much better. It's not impossible to revive the moribund musicalgenre -- it was done in 1981 with Pennies from Heaven, and severaltimes over by Baz Luhrmann, who even managed to make some of his non-professional singing stars sound pretty darn good (see Moulin Rouge).But despite all the hype, this film, to me, felt like seeing an oldfriend imperfectly resurrected from the grave, with none of the oldlively exuberance for which -- once upon a time -- he was known theworld over.
