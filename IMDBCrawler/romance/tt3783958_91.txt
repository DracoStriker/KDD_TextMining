This is simply the worst 'musical' I have ever seen. It was clear to mywife and I, about 30 minutes into this, that the actors, director andcomposer where too young to remember, or too young to understand theold musicals, and just how much talent went into those productions.The music was dreary and unmemorable, the story was uneven and madelittle sense. I think Emma Stone is a delightful actress, but this wasa huge overreach for her. Ryan Gosling was stiff and bland (as he ismost of the time).My advice to people who gave this a 10, please go watch:SINGIN' IN THE RAIN -- WEST SIDE STORY -- THE WIZARD OF OZ -- THE SOUNDOF MUSIC -- CABARET -- MARY POPPINS -- A STAR IS BORN -- MY FAIR LADY-- AN American IN Paris -- MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS -- ON THE TOWN -- THEBAND WAGONStart with that line up - then come back and watch this rubbish, andsee if its still 10 stars.
