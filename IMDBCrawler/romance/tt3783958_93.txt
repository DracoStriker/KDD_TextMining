Did someone say last year's Oscars were too white ? So let's award mostof this year's Oscars to something that looks like an explosion in apaint factory where every primary colour is splashed across the screen. LA LA LAND was being touted as the film to beat even before most ofthe other contenders were announced and its domination at the GoldenGlobes confirmed everything . Looks like the 2017 Oscars will be themost predictable event of this year Romantic musicals aren't my thing so my dread was realised in theopening scene with a California highway turning in to a song and dancescene so camp I thought I was watching a forest of pink tents whichhints at what you're going to get - feelgood factor whether you want itor not . It was at this point I seriously considered giving up on themovie and going on youtube to listen to proper love songs by the likesof The The and Joy Division As the film continued the narrative did expose itself to being what youexpect , two young people , a man and a woman , who are embarking onfulfilling their careers in respectively jazz music and acting .There's not a lot here we haven't seen before but what sells this movieis the visual work director Damien Chazelle has put in to it . Thelanguage of cinema is very much to the fore especially the stunningcinematography and my abiding memory is the scene where the twoprotagonists meet and an impact aesthetic is instantly created by theway the lighting changes . Many scenes are similarity beautiful but ifthere's a fundamental problem remains that no matter how well made afilm is if you've no interest in the genre then you won't become aconvert . As it stands LA LA LAND will dominate the Oscars like theFrench film THE ARTIST did five years ago then become quickly forgotten
