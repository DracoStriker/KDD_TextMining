This film is a bit over-hyped. 14 Oscar nominations, seriously?I saw this film yesterday, and I'm pretty sure it won't stick with mefor a very long time. The story is too flimsy. It misses edge, plot,drama... It misses depth.I was tricked by the beautiful and inspiring trailer, which summarizesthe film actually. I was also tricked by the misses who really reallywanted to see this film (which she didn't like as much as she thoughtshe would)To go short, positive aspects of Lalaland: theme song, performance ofEmma Stone, scenery and colors.Negative aspects of Lalaland: flimsy scenario without much edge,inconsistencies, sappy songs (besides theme song) and average film allin all.I wouldn't even call this film a musical, because there isn't that muchmusic in the film... And definitively not enough jazz...Three people walked out of the cinema yesterday (out of 15 people).Hardly a sign that this is a must-see movie, no?
