This movie is awful. The husband and I sat down to watch this highlyacclaimed film for the evening... and it's dreadful. We finally came toour senses and stopped about 45 minutes before the end (when the smokealarm goes off). It lacks plot and substance; it centers aroundbrittle, superficial characters who show no growth, and talent couldhave been put to use better in another medium where their talents wouldhave shined (vs. a pseudo musical). The only explanation for the awardsit's received is that it's a movie about Hollywood being voted on byHollywood. Save yourself the time, money, and headache - avoid it.
