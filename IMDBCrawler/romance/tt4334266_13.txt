Anyone rating this over a 4 is involved with the film. It's just not agood movie, the acting isn't acting and the script was most likelywritten on dennys napkins at 3am. People claiming there's an agecorrelation, saying the younger viewer explains the terrible reviews.Much like your fat body is what makes u look fat and not the dress('you', in a general sense), it's just plain a bad movie. Age has zeroto do with it, taste however is a factor. This just another nonsensicalself indulgent rubbish where hipsters claim "if you don't like it thenyou don't understand it". No, no, we fully understand it and weunderstand it's terrible lol. I'm sure the writer and director is agreat and talented person and hopefully her next venture will bebetter. I'd be extremely surprised if the director or any of the actorsbelieve this to be a quality film. This is the type of film where in afew years actors will magically not have it listed on their IMDb page.Take Carry for instance, do you think he'd be rolling the same if themovie was actually good? If it was even mildly good he'd be all overthe show making sure everyone knew he was dbag#13 in the film. I meanthis is one those films that's so bad in every single aspect thatanyone giving marks above 3-4 is related or a part of the film. It's sotransparent it's not even cool. Please, we the community of actualviewers beg you to stop skewing the stats for personal gain. To be thebest you have to beat the best. Fake reviews, not cool man. Not cool atall. P.s. I do subscribe to the reality that one or two of the positivereviews are legit but c'mon, let's get real here. That is all, pleasecarry on.
