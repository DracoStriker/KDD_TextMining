i love writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour's debut film A Girl Walks HomeAlone at Night. slow-paced, visually-oriented and highly stylised, itreminds me of the films of Jim Jarmusch. this one, on the other hand,feels more like an homage to Jodorowsky's El Topo. set in apost-apocalyptic desert wasteland, it features all of the drivingcharacteristics of A Girl Walks Home, but with added emphasis on adiverse assortment of characters and relatively sparse but memorabledialogue. i wouldn't necessarily describe it as philosophicallyprofound, but it certainly inspires contemplation the film is categorised as horror on both IMDb and Wikipedia. asidefrom a brief scene involving cannibalism near the beginning, there'snothing really horrific about this, and viewers expecting there to bewill likely be disappointed in that regard. it takes a while to getinto; each scene is drawn out to the max, with the camera repeatedlylingering on characters' facial expressions for 5 - 10 secondintervals. i'm not good at reading faces, though, and if there was somemeaning being conveyed thereby, i had difficulty interpreting it andfound it tedious to watchon the whole, it's an enjoyable and thought-provoking film that i lookforward to watching again, even if it's a little slower than seemsnecessary at times and doesn't quite measure up to Amirpour's firsteffort, in my view
