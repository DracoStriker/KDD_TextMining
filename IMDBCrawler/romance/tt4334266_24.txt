VICE TV had a hand in this which fit nicely with their alternative teleclientele. Nothing was believable in this film beginning with a girlwalking across a Texas desert with about a half gallon water, reallycut off shorts and a tank top (she did have a hat). Next we have a notexplained well, if at all, two different nearby walled in communitiesin the desert at odds with each other. One likes to capture people andcut off limbs to munch on (while still keeping what remains of themalive) the other likes to drug their members. So our female strollergets captured and loses a couple of limbs to the one group, but escapesto the other then returns to the first group of munchers. Stupid andpointless and a waste of viewing time. Was there a theme about humanity- only if you're a cannibal.
