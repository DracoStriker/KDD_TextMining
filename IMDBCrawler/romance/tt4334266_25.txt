I'm very liberal when it comes to rating movies. Not everything can be"The Usual Suspects" - I understand that.Holy crap, does this thing drag on and, man, is it trying desperatelyto be hip, edgy, cool, or something. It's like it comes up to the edgeand I think, "Ooh, it might happen here!" and then it doesn't.Dang. It's not fun. It's not even really fun in a bad way. It's just ... bad.
