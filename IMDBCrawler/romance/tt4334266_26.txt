Let's start by saying that I'm usually a good public for this kind ofslow paced, contemplative movies. That is, as long as there's somethingbeneath the surface. And here's where The Bad Batch pretty much fails :it doesn't have much to say, and tries to hide it behind a few vagueand pseudo-philosophical dialogues and nice images (one redeemingquality of the film is its photography, the other being thesoundtrack). The symbols and references keep flowing through the entiremovie, but they're always so shallow or obvious that they don't hittheir goal. At the end, all that's left is a visually nice, artsy moviewith no substance and a few known actors lost in the middle. In otherwords, a waste of the spectator's time.
