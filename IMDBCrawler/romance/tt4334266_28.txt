SPOILER ALERT! I would like to know if anyone have seen the symbolicmeaning of the movie. Is this movie speaking about EDEN, the beautifulConfort garden told in the holy bible? For me the analogy is prettyclear and obvious. Brave concept, pity that has been realized in a poorway. Except for the photography that has nice shots.
