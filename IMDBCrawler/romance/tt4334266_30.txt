The movie attempts to drive home a lot of transparencies that societiesprovide with safety and comfort and can become a detraction to life.The bad batch consist of individuals who where labeled unfit forsociety and released into an open unlawful land. It was refreshing tosee Arlen reject the area called "Comfort" and continue to wonder thedesert. The man called "The Dream" said Arlen was a sailboat at seawithout any wind because she was not happy at "Comfort". Essentially, death and survival was more probable than behind the wallsof "Comfort". The wide open of nothing. But, the individuals labeledthe "Bridge People" appeared to have a different perspective than the"Comfort People".I watched the movie twice. Not because of entertainment purposes, butbecause it reminds me of the illusions that the American society hascreated. If everything was stripped away, no food, clothing, orshelter....then the reptilian brain wakes up and survival instincts arere-enabled. Each day would consist of finding food and survival.
