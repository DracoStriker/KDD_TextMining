This seems like the result of some bad planning, they put all theirmoney into hiring actors and building the post-apocalyptic setting andtotally forgot about writing a script. Basically nothing happened, thenumerous questions that were posed remained unanswered throughout thefilm, they walked and they walked but never got there. Is that themeaning of the film? Never getting there? 0,5 out of 10, complete wasteof time.
