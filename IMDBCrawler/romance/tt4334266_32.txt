This review contains a small spoiler. The script was weak and without clear center. Coupled with thedirection, It lacked a clarity of what if any the desert society'smoral or ethical base base might be. Given that the environment is apart of the story, I felt it was under emphasized. The direction andshooting of the main characters emotional content was good, Thedirecter did establish 'connection' with the characters. I felt theinterplay of the characters themselves could have been better. Iattribute that the the script. Suki Waterhouse did a great job for the material she had, i.e. wordsput in her mouth, or lack thereof. She was very good given thelimitation of a less than developed script. She displayed the subtextof emotion well. But a few words more would have elevated the part.Jason Mamoa,I thought did a first rate job. He is very adept as thedangerous giant, who even as he carries an aura of death, silently sobeautifully conveys complex and deep emotion, even compassion. KeanuReeves played the philosophic opportunist who rationalizes hisexistence and flexible morality with an air of caring, yet adeceptively dangerous indifference.One flaw sticks out. Alert, this may be a spoiler. There is a scenewhere three characters sit around a fire cooking and eating the eveningmeal. The fire ring, is common to all of us. Some stones stacked in acircle ring, and the fire burns within. What is wrong with that? Well,they were sitting in the mid of what appeared to be a salt flat, or drylake. Flat for hundreds of yards. No foliage close, no wood. JasonMamoa, a girl with one arm, and a kid? Who will carry wood for a fire,and gather heavy stones? Sitting in mid dry flat, not a sprig withinreach? Nope.
