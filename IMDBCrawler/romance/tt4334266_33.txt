Pretentious rubbish. Pacing is terrible, story is almost non existent, and the dialogue(when it does happen) is average at best.This feels like a series of stylistically beautiful visuals (which iswhy I gave it a 3 and not a 0) strung together, almost like a bigbudget film school project, but without any storytelling substance totie it all together and make it something good.I really get the sense that she's watched a lot of Tarantino films, andthen tried to make one of her own without actually understanding whatit is that makes a Tarantino film so good.
