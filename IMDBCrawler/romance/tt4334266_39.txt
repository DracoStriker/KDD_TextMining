The Bad Batch isn't a bad film at all, it just doesn't follow the basicprinciple of introducing characters, introducing plot, solving plotwith a twist here and there, happy end. It reminded me a lot of QuentinTarantino's "Death Proof", which took AGES to tell you what itsactually about.The Bad Batch just lets the story run its course, like its a livingbeing itself.At times, this means you wish for some more context or dialog, hencethe 6 stars only, but mostly this film is an outlook of the tomorrowworld IF we let today's world run unopposed. Politicans and media loveto talk about the split society of the rich and powerful trying tosideline the rest. The Bad Batch gives us a glimpse of how this could(would?) end, with a pinch of terribly dark humor.For that, and the surprisingly high level cast, its well worthwatching.
