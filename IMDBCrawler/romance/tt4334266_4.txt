You'll need to suspend all of your disbelief to close the holes in thismovie's plot, starting with the pumping-iron, body-building cannibals,working out and living in aluminum airplane wreckage in the burningdesert sun, in the middle of nowhere. Sun block anyone? Enter Protagonist Suki Waterhouse, 25, acting age 17, cute and lean,and apparently in the eyes of the body-builders, ready for the BBQ-Grill... Fresh Meat over aged, in wings and legs the saying goes?Predictably, escape follows, and Suki finds Keanu's Village of DJ's,Drugs, Dirt. (Keanu at least has a swimming pool and clean towels)That's Not good enough for Suki, She's in love with the Cubano, the"Artist" (and lead cannibal) with the mute daughter. Cubano's MuteDaughter is a MacGuffin.The movie starts off "OK", with a good pace, and despite poor actingskill (Suki is mostly eye-candy, with a squeaky voice to match), itmaintains an interesting premise. But then dramatically FIZZLES afterSuki revenge kills Cubano's girlfriend. Then the "distopian love story"plot takes over and the movie is just embarrassing. There is zerochemistry between the actors, the writing is hideously awkward, and thelocation seems impossible. Grade F. I would recommend the movie: "A boy and his Dog" for a successfulexample of this kind of Protagonist Survival in a post-apocalypticworld (with cannibals.)
