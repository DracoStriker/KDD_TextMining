I STRONGLY recommend everyone watch this. Is it good? No. Is it coherent? Hah! Is it the worst movie ever? Quitepossibly.So why would I recommend anyone watch this steaming pile of incoherentgarbage? To come back and read the IMDb reviews after.There's something cathartic about seeing the immense anger of all theother poor viewers who survived this experience. Their frustration,their rage, their inability to comprehend the world any longer... afteryou watch this "movie," you too will understand that sensation. And itis truly uniting.... but from the perspective of a good use of time, no, don't watchthis. It has no plot, horrible acting, and dialogue written by (andlikely for) a 4 year old. It did have one incredible accomplishmentthough - the director managed to turn $6 million into $100,000 boxoffice gross. So it has that going for it.
