Awesome film & acting by all cast - Suki was fantastic & such a naturalbeauty throughout. Her acting is intense & deep & Suki is well suitedto this role. Keanu was himself as always & played the part well asalways. So a great film & interesting story line & it is like thebeauty breaks the Beast when she finally gets close to Miami Man JasonMomoa. The filming looked so 'complete' when Arlen was filmed with noleg & no arm - very clever filming!. Such a Retro film that it made ita classic.
