I was intrigued when I watched the trailer and I kept waiting for themovie to be out. Once I watched it I was disappointed to read all thebad reviews. Some of them, fortunately only two or three, lack validarguments and merely state that the movie is bad. I love thephotography, I found the choice of the colour palettes pretty good andconsistent. There is a pretty good selection of tunes for thesoundtrack, they perfectly match the mood of this movie. The rhythm ofits cinematography is working well. The story kept me entertained. Icould tell that some members wanted sex scenes and other strong imagerybut I think it was not necessary. The movie delivers its messages evenwith a minimal script. There is a basic call to pure human instinctslike chemical attraction, fatherhood/motherhood, the life goal search.It is actually more delicate than what I thought It would have beenafter watching the trailer and I loved this contrast. I look forward towatch more movies from this director.
