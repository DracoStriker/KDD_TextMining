Where to start.AMAZING cast, high hopes, good direction, TERRIFIC cinematography and aDystopian future to boot....What else can you ask for????A script that does not read like a bad night of binge drinking.The storyline was horrendous. The female lead acts like she does shoecommercials. WORST "Essay" accent EVER from Momoa. Keanu looked like hehad studied for the role of John Holmes, complete with just BADdialogue. Ribisi.....screaming at the sidewalk crazy, not cool crazy.Albeit, Jim Carry was perfect in his part.This viewed like a kid's idea of the future. Confusion, dead endscenarios, lopsided and pointless plot and to me it was like that sillyacting joke " Do the Oscar-worthy film, then the artsy film, to keepsafe" for...everyone involved. It's like someone said " Hey! I have abreakout idea along the lines of Robert Rodriguez's Mariachi, that'sgoing to be BIG once it's made!...and laughed when someone fell for it.Wait for this to be on youtube, for the love of God. Do not spend aSINGLE penny to see this. Hell, the effort of turning the thing on,even on youtube, may be a reason to sue them for a loss of personalenergy, in the effort of clicking, to be subjected to the most amazingcinematographic pile of refuse....I mean, the camera man was a God andthe only praiseworthy participant in this entire debacleMy title is EXACTLY what I said out loud, when the credits started toroll. Proved to me that a great line up does not always equate tosatisfaction....or even something considered to be worth watching forfree....Yeesh. The 3 star rating was for the scenery and camera work.The movie is a dead in the hole 1, on it;s own
