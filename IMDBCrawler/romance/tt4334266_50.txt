Desert exile, a cult leader with an armed and pregnant harem androaming gangs of hungry cannibals, are only some of the worries forsolitary Arlen. She is very resourceful and open minded though. Shemanages to make her way on a gnawed leg, to a frontier settlement offree dealing outlaws. Arlen attempts to lay low in this town with anapparently abandoned little girl and her pet rabbit. With the cultleader showing interest in the pair and a burly cannibal searching forhis little girl, Arlen is faced with some difficult choices. There aretruths she needs to find for herself.There are glimmers of Amirpour's amazing previous film, A Girl WalksHome Alone at Night, including funky music, fantastic light displays,beautiful people, charming spontaneity, skateboards, gorgeous hot pantsand grisly encounters. Keanu Reeves makes a delightful appearance asthe harem loving cult leader and Jim Carrey as an impulsive andsunburnt hermit. I wish there was more depth to the dialogue. Longpauses work better with excellent actors, and the stars of the film donot have this range yet. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International FilmFestival.
