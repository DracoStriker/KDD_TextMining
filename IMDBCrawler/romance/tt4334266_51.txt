From the first moment it's painfully obvious what this flick was tryingto appeal to movie goers with. It relies heavily on suggestive imageryand it's clearly supposed to be deep and thought provoking. Instead itbrings that particular kind of moral relativism that makes anybody witha working moral compass sick to death. I'm sorry, but portrayingcannibals as anything else than disgusting monsters dressed up aspeople? No thanks. Maybe you're supposed to sympathize with thatbarely-literate hunk looking for his daughter among piles of garbage.Well good look to you, but considering I just saw him kill, chop up,cook and eat a human being, I just can't do it. This movie doesn'tbother with explanation and consequently makes no sense, it's jumbled,and worst of all, it's just plain boring. And for story aboutcannibals, I think that's an achievement. Just probably different thanwhat the creators had in mind. (The only thing about this movie thatwas something of a revelation to me, is that even a man as attractiveas Jason Momoa can be turned into an utter creeper by an ugly mustache.But that's about it.)
