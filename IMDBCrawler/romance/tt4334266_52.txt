Seatbelts on and go, get immersed in a raw, gore, cannibal andultra-cool world, the first 15' will make you happy or will make youdespite this movie, for me was awesome! very interesting visuallyconcept, transitions between music/image, excellent work of artdepartment, yeah it is a movie for young people, there is blood, gore,cannibalism, drugs, and romanticism. Perfect seasoning, I'll waitanxiously for the next movie from this director.Jim Carey was stunning,jason momoa, suki and the rest of the cast were just perfect. A movieto really enjoy and it will keep you up all the movie.
