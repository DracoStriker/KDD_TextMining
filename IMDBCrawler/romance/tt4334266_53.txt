Exiled Ravers take over Burning Man posing as overly cool desert MadMaxers dropping hits of acid while decked out in battery poweredChristmas tree wreaths & other Hipster regalia,paying $1500 for ticketsin what looks to be the day after remains of Burning Man 2016....except with a steroid meat-head poser artist with a taste for humanflesh hovering on the outskirts of Bartertown ...I mean Acidtown orWhatever. It's all just bullshit .Nothing makes the slightest sense...but I guess it's deep,spiritual &crammed with intellectual adroitness making everynonsensical,pretentious techno scene have a deeper meaning, The averageblue collar lunkhead science fiction fan will never comprehend....but Ido. This movie reeks of trying to be a long remembered cult indie filmbut actually would make perfect fodder for the original Mystery ScienceTheater 3000. Now back to Acid Trip,Mad Max is now replaced by girl power blondemillennial wandering the wasteland of Tatooine or Las Vegas ...doesn'tmatter where. The endless desert vistas makes any loony storyinteresting...for a while.The cute heroine seeks revenge for trailer trash cannibals capturing &then amputating her right arm & left leg after being dropped off in theForbidden Zone by Homeland Security. After escaping on askateboard,rolling herself along a dry lake (story jumps the rails )she is brought to Bartertown...heals her stumps while lethargicallywatching Bartertown's Hipsters gather near the courthouse waiting formayor (Keanu Reeves) to host another nightly rave party (just like fromthe Matrix trilogy) Latter she wonders off,meets GQ cannibal , falls in Love with thebeefcake meat-head that ate half of her six months previously ...why?Low self esteem is what I figure,the oiled down hunk meat-head is agood father to his mute 9 year old biracial daughter (points) drawspretty birds (points) & has awesome prison pecs,tats & sensitivity(points points points)But beefcake is a cannibal after all so it's not perfect (minus pointsfor gnawing on bone marrow ) But for stumpy it's a marriage made inheaven.The Cameo of the homeless bum Jim Carrey tooling around with hisshopping cart is stolen straight out of 'The Road' with Viggo Mortensen...the plagiarism ruins deep ...actually allot is stolen from TheRoad,Mad Max & others of the Doomsday genre. The long drawn out scenesof fading B character actors tripping on a cocktail of Ecstasy & Ego(that's you Carrey & Keanu ) while wandering the Mohave sound-stage isbizarre .I missed seeing the deeper meanings while fast forwarding tothe end. Please bury this latest Bad Batch under the desert floor.
