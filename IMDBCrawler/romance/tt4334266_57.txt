The Bad Batch is a bizarre, sometimes fascinating, but mostlydreadfully glacial, try hard artsy film. The main problem with it isthat it confuses silence and a plodding pace for depth, and despitesome unique moments, it's really not worth your time. The story is actually a fairly interesting one, something that youcould see in a Mad-Max type of film, but unfortunately the premise ismostly squandered on shots of empty expanse and our main character, thelifeless Suki Waterhouse, staring dead eyed, either sober or onhallucigenic drugs from Keanu Reeves. If she had given a betterperformance I might have cut this film some more slack, but in thismovie she has about as much personality as a piece of plain white bread(which is also a good metaphor for the movie as a whole). It's there,it serves it's purpose, but its ultimately forgettable and bland. Withactors like Keanu Reeves and Jim Carrey, I'm surprised that thedirector chose this actress for the lead. Even Jason Momoa gives amiddling performance. Keanu is hard not to love in everything, but hisrole could be played by pretty much anybody else. Jim Carrey doesn'tsay a word.To resist the urge to rip this movie to shreds, I'll say that thescenes between Momoa and Waterhouse are the highest point in the movie.My favorite scene in the entire movie is where they hide from asandstorm. It only lasts a couple of seconds but it's one of the onlymoments in the movie where you actually feel a connection between twohuman beings. Ultimately, under a better or more talented director and with a morelikable lead this movie could have been something, but as it standsit's a mostly lifeless shell of something that could have been decent,with a couple of interesting moments thrown in. I wouldn't recommendseeing it, for art house fans or not. It's just not a good movie.
