This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen at least half of. I feel like this film was ported from the wilds of the mid-90s, whenthis kind of kitschy post- apocalyptic setting was used as an excusefor dozens, if not hundreds, of lets-be-very-generous- and-call-thempassion projects, where someone figured that if they put enough neatpeople in a dusty frame, and gave them nothing to say, some sensationof meaning would magically appear. It worked no better in this than itdid then. This movie makes The Six-String Samurai look like a classic. Why cast Momoa as an insultingly stereotyped Mexican? Why not have, Idon't know, a plot? The lead is set adrift with nothing to do, say, orbe - except sort of...erotically disabled? Was that what the directorwas aiming for? This is a confusing and upsetting film, and I don'tknow how it was allowed to carry on for as long as it did withoutsomeone trying to fix it.
