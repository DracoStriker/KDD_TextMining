The true answer to that question can be summaries in a several sequel,or you can just try to watch this "movie". When this movie came out, I truly recognize a great new sci-fifranchise, something like Orwell's "1984" theme, my concerns that VICEproduct this movie was left somewhere in my back head. I was so excitedabout this movie. We didn't have a proper, the world is desert, moviefor some time, I mean if you don't count Mad Max: Furry road from 2016. But, this is true, when ever you left your concerns somewhere in theback of the head, they often cam and bite you on your ass. Expectation - HIGH Realistic - Fu.... VICEIdea was there, idea was abandoned, they thought that is enough just tobe cool. To be honest, the whole vibe is kinda weird, and it is notrepulsive, it is interesting. But that is that. Characters are nonexisted, the story is non existed. I expected to be some howdocumentary narration, but it isn't. It is just bunch of long sequelscenes without any dialogue, and with youth alternative music, to saylike that. In other words, the are just trying to be cool, to have thatstreet modern "we are fu..ed and free vibe". The whole concept of movie preparation remanded me on Gaspar Noe 2015movie "Love", which is just little more artsy porn, when he say "Thescript was on two pages", and that say a lot about movie. The same ishere. Ana Lily Amirpour, didn't provide us anything with this move, she justmake a very bad narration in that huge wish to be good. When thisthings happen, and when fun of work is changed with "This will be thebest thing ever", often things go south, like here, deep south.
