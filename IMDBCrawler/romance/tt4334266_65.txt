This certainly starts out on the right foot. Sort of. The viewer isnever given any explanations at all, which is great, and has to figureout what exactly is going on. That said, the first half hour is veryintriguing, if not borderline silly and weird for no real reason.After you get sucked in, having spent that half hour trying to figurethings out; the film turns into a very forced art film. The kind thatyou would normally see at a friend's house in Ann Arbor, and yourfriend just dropped out of U of M's film school after 3 semesters. Onlydifference here is this has a good sized budget, and Keanu in ahilariously fake mustache and wig.Deliberately slow, this film forces a "meditation" on possibly suburbannormalcy or just insider/outsider culture. The last half of the filmdrags you into a very hip and boring rave with aspirations to be elite.Our hero leaves that to exist in the desert as an outsider eating(possibly) human flesh to survive. That's it.Like I said, the first part gets you hooked, but the last 3/4 of thefilm I kept reaching for the off button. The train wreck effect kept mewatching, even though I rolled my eyes constantly and even said aloudseveral times, "oh, come ON already!" Save your precious time forstudying Orson Welles, Godard, or Jodorowsky.
