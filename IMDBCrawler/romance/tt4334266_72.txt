The setting and setup of the movie was interesting, and had potentialto go somewhere. However, that didn't happen. Some big actors in themovie, but generally their performances weren't great, but its not likethey had much to work with. The main character was terrible. She wasextremely uninteresting--in fact, usually the opposite of interesting.Her acting was often questionable. In the movie, she had some prettycringy scenes. However, it could be argued that that was reflective ofthe terrible character she was playing. The movie seemed to devolveinto getting cheap "entertainment" off of gore scenes, to make up fornot much really happening in the movie. If you are into weird moviesthat have some interesting concepts, and have some patience, I'd saythe first half is worth watching, but go in with low expectations.
