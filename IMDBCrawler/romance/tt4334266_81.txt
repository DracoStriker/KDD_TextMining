Good idea, looks good, great cast... What could go wrong?Well, besides it being incredibly boring (with the odd spark ofbrilliance, good turn by an almost unrecognisable Jim Carrey) it justlacks depth.I didn't find myself warming to any of the characters, it was allsuperficial and in the end I found myself just wondering what else Icould be watching instead.This film will probably get some sort of cult following but it doesn'tdeserve it.
