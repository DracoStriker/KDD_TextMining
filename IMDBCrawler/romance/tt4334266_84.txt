From my perspective and personal opinion this movie long-term will beone that's underrated at it's own time ,but will end up like a classiccult masterpiece through the years. I really loved the cinematic combined with excellent music! This moviereally kept me interested all along even though the plot was a littlebit slow (but in my opinion everything blended perfectly).. The way thescript was written and directed, brilliant acting... not much wordsneeded to be said whereas movie scenes talk on their own! Lots ofemotions were generated throughout the movie. Personally I think it wasa brilliant movie and something different from what I have seen tillnow. That's my first review I ever wrote on internet for a movie. Personally I was a little disturbed from the low rating that this moviehas earned and driven to write a whole review on my own. In the endit's important not to judge a book by its cover but have your ownexperience with it! So if you watch it I hope you enjoy as much as Idid!
