Pros: - It's different. - It's got decent actors. - It's got KeanuReeves.Cons: - It's a lot of work for the return. - Story is so-so. (Okay,it's not very satisfying to me, but I'm trying to be open minded). -It's got Keanu Reeves. - The dream cult.Casual Cannibalism- This goes in the pros list if you're pro casual cannibalism,otherwise in the cons.Review Overview:The movie is just okay which is not really okay. The desertpost-apocalyptic genre is almost as played out as the zombie genre. Soif you're going to make another movie about this, at least havesomething more to add or something to say. You could *not see thisfilm* and you wouldn't have missed anything. The only interesting partfor me was the dream cult. The movie could be titled "A year in thelife of the fine young cannibals".Gripes: The overall 'world' doesn't make much sense to me. Why is therecannibalism when there is, apparently, a reasonable amount of food. Iguess this makes it more of a "life choice"? - Why would a grouptolerate being preyed upon by the cannibals? - Would there really be agroup of pumped up weight lifters when food is so scarce? - Maybe ifyou spent less time skate boarding you could farm more food?
