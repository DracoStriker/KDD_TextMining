OK If you want to wonder how someone could have those kinds of actorsand make a mess of a movie watch this one. I struggle to call this a movie. As a movie generally tries to tellsome kind of a story. I like a movie that leaves me asking questions. This one left me askingtwo.WTF was this?Can I get my 2 hours refunded back to me ? as I would like to spend itin line at the DMV.If someone sees this with no prior knowledge of the premise they wouldbe lost as it would make zero sense to them. They may wonder where therest of the movie is?I know I did.Nothing was explained even a little. I have never used the expressionworst movie I have ever seen. But I am for this one.
