A Masterpiece. Acting, Characters, Cinematic, Soundtrack, Plot,everything is there SOLID. Absolutely solid flick. Average guy don'tunderstand just like average guy don't understand himself. First moviecharacters are actually an alter ego of the actors so its perfectacting method style. ALL the actors are perfect, all of them. Theplastic of the movie is intense, amazing. Painting style. A Master offilm making. The plot is just cool for the story. I like the silence ofthe movie, not only it elevates it in intelligence but also fits a lotto the setting of the movie and makes it even more realistic.Soundtrack is glamorous and ferocious.
