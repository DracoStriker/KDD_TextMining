It's a surrealistic movie about a girl seeking redemption over the factthat some cannibals living in the dessert ate her arm and leg.This is the second time I herd Jason Momoa play a Latino. He's tryingto get good at the accents. I don't know if he is Latino, I assumedthat he was Samoan or partly like Dwayne Johnson. Guess Momoa is tryingnot to be typecast (Although there are not enough Samoans inHollywood).Jim Carrey is in the movie. He's actually amazing in it. It's more of adrama, and Carrey gives us the best laugh of the movie, it was so good.The Bad Bacth has not much going on in it. Most likely better if I wason weed. It's very slow and it's not all the best slow.
