This is definitely one of the strangest films I've seen in a longwhile. It didn't really give me anything significant to ponder or wrapme up in a world of illusion for an hour and a half as so many filmsdo. My brain sort of said, 'there's not much to work with here so justsit back and see where it takes you'. I did, and it subtly took me to abarren wasteland with confusing scenes, odd situations and nothing thatseemed very well defined. The dialogue is sparse and though the storyis wispy thin and ill formed, it does snare you as it meanders throughour starlets journey of ill fated occurrence.This film is another one that's pretty out there. The premise is weirdand if that doesn't sit well with you from the outset I don't thinkyou're going to like this one. The acting is good, the direction isgood, there are some great looking scenes, some gory and ratherunpalatable violence that is done in an unbelievably blasé way, and alot of implausibility.The 'Mad Max barren back drop coupled with the hedonistic clubbing vibethat seems to permeate in some scenes is insane, and in fact similarsituations of incongruity are littered through out this piece.All said I think it's worth watching; if it's your kinda thing yourgoing to like it. It's quirky in a listless sort of way, it's easy,it's arty but it's also quite different.
