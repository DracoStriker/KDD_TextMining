This movie is so awful, that it is hard to find words to describe it. Ireally can't imagine why there are so many people that are willing togo and see in in the cinemas. This movie is not bad, because of theidea for an affair between a rich businessman and a normal girl. It isbad because the dialogues are flat, the characters are terrible andwithout any depth, there is no actual acting in it, and for the finalthe story is badly written.It is really sad, that such a badly made movies are so popular. Theydestroy the idea for good movie with acting, script and everythingelse. And if you expect to see at least a lot of erotic in it, you mayfell a bit disappointed at the end. The movie is far from that itpromises to its viewers.
