Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! This isthe worse film I've ever seen, the original is the second worse. It's a2 hour bore fest where nothing happens. This film is full of random sexscenes with no reason of being there. This could only appeal to womenwho want to see something they would find arousing. The plot can besummarized in a few line, which i won't do to make this spoiler free.If you have any appreciation for films avoid! Do not support thisdisgusting attempt to be an entertaining piece of fiction!
