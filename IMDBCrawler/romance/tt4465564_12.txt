Storyline: 0/10 I don't really see any up or down in the story-line.It's only sex and sex and nonsense stuff. I meant "stuff" becausethere's nothing to describe. Honestly, people come to watch the moviebecause of the sex scene only, and it is even worse than the 1st part.Lesson: if you're rich, you get everything, even a sex slave. That isliterally everything from the movie. I rarely say a movie is bad, butthis movie is so bad that I even hate it. I regret my $10 and120minutes watching a bunch of BS like this.
