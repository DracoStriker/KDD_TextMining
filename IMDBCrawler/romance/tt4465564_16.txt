The movie is almost the exact same as the first one. Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have no chemistry. Feels like theydidn't even attempt to try and do better than the first one. There are about four or five plot holes that had potential but ifwritten well, they would have made it work on screen.Cheesy, terrible and cringe-worthy dialogue. The sex scenes are not sexy, and what makes them even less sexy is themusic during the scenes. The MAJOR problem I had with the film is how Anastasia is written. Thisis yet another weak female character on screen who likes to be bossedaround and controlled by Jamie Dornan's character, Christian. If you are fans of the book, I think you might enjoy it but they shouldhave just left them as books. The dialogue and characters are writtenbadly on paper but the author manages to make it work somehow.
