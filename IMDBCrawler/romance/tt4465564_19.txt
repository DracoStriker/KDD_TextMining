Unlike the first movie, this one's pacing felt choppy. And why did itcontain so many plot holes? I know they switched directors, but didthey change the screenwriter as well? The movie appeared as if it werewritten by someone who took up screen writing the week before filmingbegan. Seriously, some of the scenes lacked proper transition, flow,and some scenes were so damn awkward that they were almost too painfulto watch. The dialogue felt constricted and seemed unrealistic attimes. And unlike the first movie's intimate scenes, the sex scenes inFifty Shades Darker just felt flat and played out more like an uneditedvideo from Pornhub rather than a major film production. Had I not seenthe first film, I would've blamed the terrible execution of this movieon the actors. But, it's obvious they tried and unfortunately failedbecause they had to do the best they could with the meek scriptprovided.
