My God, Where to begin? this movie was awful in so many ways that makea list would be such a waste of time. Anyway, I can mention the mostprominent and substantial to me, starting by the most elementary piecewhich is the idea behind the whole story, in other words the subtext ormessage that the film delivers. This is no other thing but a teenagerwet dream, founded on the most shameless shallowness andsuperficiality: Is the story of a naive young girl obsessed with theactual prototype of perfect spouse in every aspect important for thesociety, millionaire, handsome, fit, hard-sex addict, possessive andtough guy, so tough that he even resists an helicopter crash to comeback without a scratch; so basically what the movie tries to unfoldit's an attempt to tell a story where this girl keeps striving to catchthis guy and engage him into a "serious relationship" without all ofhis flaws and addictions, in this process all of his evil ex's andspooky characters of his past will try to stop her in such predictablemanners that you will have to throw some popcorn to others in theaterto get amused if possible. This links to the second aspect to bring up: The Script. This script isso dull and predictable that you would regret buying your ticket in thefirst 15 min, it's so dummy and felts so unreal that in some point getslaughable, the characters and dialogues are so shallow and the plottwists are far more predictable than fast and furious or any bad horrormovie. Linked to that the actors don't help too much, it could beenough with that script but no, the director and producers want you tosuffer in every possible way, they throw you a complete platter ofmediocrity performances, overacted and fictitious, filled withnonsensical dialogues and cheap jokes. In the technical aspect there's no much to say, it's another big studiofail, a nearly invisible treatment in the visual camp, mediocrephotography, sound mixing and editing which is refilled with pop musicto solve the problem. In conclusion, 50 Shades Darker it's the perfect opportunity to getyour daughter most desired obsessions emerged, or even your girlfriendcan connect to the cheap-fake fairy tale of sex and passion this moviedelivers.
