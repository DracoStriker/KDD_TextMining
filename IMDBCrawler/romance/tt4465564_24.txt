Just saw #FiftyShadesDarker, wow... That was painful, and I don't meanin that good, just got spanked way.Worst screenplay adaptation ever, worst dialog, worst cinematography,and worst direction. They couldn't even keep the staging of interiorsconsistent - this supposedly takes place a WEEK after the first movie!I can't fault the acting, they had absolutely nothing to work with, infact I'm impressed they managed the dialogue without throwing up. Theonly redeeming quality, Jaimie Dornan's very buff, naked body.Really disappointing, and I loved the books and the first movie. Evenmore disappointing, they shot Darker and Freed at the same time, so Idoubt there's any hope for Freed.
