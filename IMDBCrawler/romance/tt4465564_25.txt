This movie really sucked. I was expecting it to be like the first onebut I really did not expect it to be this convoluted, illogical andnonsensical. Fifty Shades of Grey should not be so financiallysuccessful, the fact that the first one made so much money reallyupsets me. I hated the over arching plots that did not tie into the'story' at all and were REALLY forced into the 'story', but reallythere was no story, or no real reason to want to invest your time intothese 'characters'. I hate movies like this that claim to be so R-ratedbut really are just a very extreme 15+. It became a comedy rather thana dramatic romance film because of its terrible writing, staleperformances and overall confusing 'plot' that made no sense and reallydid not need to exist. This movie is a 1/10 because it is incrediblyannoying and really did not need to be made.
