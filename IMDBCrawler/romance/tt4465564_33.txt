Two years ago, when I saw Fifty Shades of Grey, I knew this day wouldcome, looming, like a dark, boring cloud on the horizon. If, for some strange and grotesque, you happened to enjoy the firstmovie, you'll like this one. If you are everyone else on the face theplanet, yeah, it's just more of the same boring who-hockey that we'veseen before. There is very little to like about this film.The good: Like the first movie, it's a slickly crafted movie with goodaesthetics and a rad soundtrack..... Yeah, that's pretty much it.The good news is that it holds pretty close to the source material, thebad news is that it's almost as though the source material is badTwilight fan fiction that some chick wrote on the notepad app on heriPhone....., oh wait, that's exactly what it is. I sh?? you not. This really isn't good. It makes less sense than anything I've seen ina long, long time.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that you watch this under anycircumstance.
