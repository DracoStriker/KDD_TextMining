Having seen the first movie in the "Fifty Shades" trilogy, I knew thiswas most likely going to suck. And it did. The only reason I got to seeit is because that's the movie my girlfriend picked for us to see onValentine's Day. Before seeing it, I thought "this one seems to have aplot, unlike the first one". While it did have a plot, the writing was so lazy and dull, that allthe plot points and twists were just bland. Like, completely bland. Notthat there were any major twists at all. It's all just so confusing andboring at the same time, that the only thing you want is the movie toend. That's all I wanted. And the worst thing is, that the movie isnearly 2 hours long. The performances were cringe-worthy. That's not really a fault of thecast. I blame the terrible writing. I do think some of the actors havereal charisma (Dakota Johnson for example) but that's just not theright movie. Even the most talented actor in cinema history wouldn't beable to give a great - or at least mediocre - performance in this movie(or any movie of this trilogy). The characters are just as bland as the plot. You can't care aboutthem. What happens in their lives and their relationship is unrealisticand uninteresting. And just like the first movie, BDSM isn't even atheme. You don't get to see any BDSM action. To conclude, I think the only reason someone has to see this movie, isbecause they are bored to death, have nothing else to see, or becausethey are curious to see how bad this movie is. The thing is, it's notjust bad. It's a piece of trash.
