Wow! Was that dreadful! I know the reviews were bad, but I didn'trealize just how bad it was going to be. Aesthetically, there were someredeeming qualities. The cinematography was actually pretty good.Crisp, clear shots. Decent set-up. Beautiful outdoor shots. The musicwas passable, though not as good as the music in the original. Hair,make-up and wardrobe were good. However, while no movie can includeeverything from the book,this movie is a long advertisement for thebook. Here are some scene teasers- read the book to find out whatreally happened. It seemed very fly by night in it's assembly. Oh-don't forget to touch on this, spend 30 seconds on that..... The actingwas perfunctory at best. Not that Jaime Dornan can act his way out of apaper bag on a really good day, but there seemed to be a "phone it in","let's get this over with", quality to everyone's performance. WhenMarcia Gay Harden isn't convincing, there's a problem. There were a lotof really good, experienced actors in the supporting cast who wereunderutilized with their 5-7 total lines each. I don't think throwingMrs. Jones 2 lines added much to the plot. Dakota Johnson did what shecould with what she had to work with, but unfortunately the script waseven worse than the dialog in the book. The sex scenes were bland,lacking chemistry. Whereas the first movie took it's time to set up thetone and mood for the scenes, this movie was more like- oh yea, in thebook they have sex now so let's write in a quick scene before the nextcrisis happens. And Jaime D has his pants on for all of them. Contractstipulation? Whereas, Dakota was naked for much of the film. Note tofilmmaker, people who buy tickets to this movie don't but them to seeher naked.
