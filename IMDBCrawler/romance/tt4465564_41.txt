My overwhelming emotion upon watching fifty shades darker isembarrassment, embarrassment for the two leading actors being involvedin this car crash of a film (or should i say helicopter crash). I canonly imagine having to come back and star in and promote such bile fora second time must be even more painful than the first film. Igenuinely think Dornan looks embarrassed throughout the film,making ituncomfortable to watch. The image of him inserting the kinky balls ofsteel (no pun, he actually did) will haunt him for his entire career iam sure Johnson too. The sound track is great and cinematography was good. At one point mymind wandered on how nice the glass was within the office Ana worked atand it was at this point i considered making my run for it out of thecinema, never a good sign that you are thinking of the decor whilstwatching a so called erotic film. The sex scenes were really quite tepid,i am sure Mr Grey kept histrousers on for the majority of them ; Most exciting part was wonderingif he was going to get his manhood trapped in the zipper of histrousers....... Instead of thinking how steamy it all was i referred back to myconstant thought that Mr Dornan must had had written into his contractnudity below the belt must be kept to a minimum, it's a shame DakotaJohnson didn't have the same as her boobies we on show quite a lot,seemed unfair !To be fair to the actors the story is so threadbare that going for ahaircut was quite a major scene in the film; There were times withinthe film that were funny but i'm not sure of they were intentionallywritten to be; It was quite a cringe feast throughout.Both the main characters have been miscast, Christian Grey needed to beplayed by a far more sterner, bigger actor than the likable boy nextdoor Dornan, and Ana's character screamed for someone more ..wellsexier. I haven't seen Dakota in any other film but i've watched The Fall inwhich i consider Jamie Dornan to be amazingly brilliant, i don't seehow he can flip flop between being so good and so bad; I guess it'sdown to the script?It's a shame that Fifty shades has been singled out for stardom asthere are far better books to draw such saucy screen plays from whichactually have a story to them, stories that the actors might actuallyhave some good dialogue to work with.
