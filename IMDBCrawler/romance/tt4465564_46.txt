The only reasonable idea behind this pathetic effort for acting in thissparkle and slurp film is the wages. Come on, Love?! Love is the cradleof everything, it's the palace of your inner- self, your heart, filledwith emptiness to everything you can imagine, but always the cradle ofLove.Not so in this movie. In Fifty Shades of Grey you are encountering atconstant frequency some of the neat stuff rich gurls & bois can buy,for real. Some hipster gimmicks, interior, cars, jewelry, and so on.Brands, brands, brands, you are starting to get hot? What is love? I can't say so far, but in terms of what wealth is, thismovie does an impressive good job. Beside this annoyances every animaldocumentary should reflect more about love and being wild at something.Every minute advancing in this movie, my rear unit just starts feelingwarmer and warmer, reeling in that seat, hours felt, and I did startthinking what could cause this subjective impression of weight gain? Imsettled, I'm a rock, and how great, like a sitting rock in all of itsFifty Shades of Grey.You'd start thinking about yourself, and find out that the very intensething about such movies is something you can't explain, it is in theair. It is something living, real persons, that are involved. Best Icould think of was ...they are actors. And it never felt quite thatobvious as in this film. Maybe this would be interesting, intense,thoughtful,... if this persons would have done this in real, felt,breathed. Your probably not going to say this about some Alien movie,but in a love story, yes sure, you would do. The brazenness wasn'tanymore vibrant like in 9½ Weeks, taking all your attention, but moreabout this attitude they come up with to draw more money out of yourpockets with this slick bang-A-Maid stuff.Albeit, i guess the set probably had some fun making thisall-you-can-love munchies theater, but I don't see any sense beyondthat. 02/10
