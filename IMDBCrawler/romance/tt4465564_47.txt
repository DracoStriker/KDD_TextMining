I just think that what is the point in having a sequel for a film thatturned out to be completely disastrous! Then the final third one comesout in 2019 which I think, two is just enough to be completely awfulfor a romance movie like this. What was EL James thinking honestly? Fifty shades of grey and darkerare just terrible. I even promised myself that I will not watch thesequel but some people were going on about it that I just, want to seeit. Not because I love it but actually want to see the different andbelieve me, it's pretty much the same s*it really like the first one.I'm so definitely not watching the third, it even sounds equal to theother two. Avoid if you can!
