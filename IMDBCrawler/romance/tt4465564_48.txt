"Hey Theo , what's a young good looking boy like you doing sittingalone watching films on Valentines day ? You should be taking abeautiful woman out on a romantic date " Well thanks for the concern but I really do think Christopher Hitchenssummed up the long term sexual relationship perfectly by the soundbite"Now this is masochism - but it's being offered to you by sadists" .The Hitch was of course referring to religion but both religion and thelong term sexual relationship have an identical definition . I'm alsoreminded of how Albert Einstein described idiocy:"Doing the same thingover and over again expecting a different result" . In the case of the50 SHADES narrative we're subjected to idiotic masochism If you've seen the first film you'll be entirely puzzled as to thecasting because I don't think I've seen an actor and actress so badlycast in a film where the whole concept of the story revolves aroundsexual attraction . Both Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are two actorsbest suited for lead roles in a bland daytime soap opera . Let's remindourselves Christian Grey is a multi billionaire oozing in Byronicsexuality while Ana Steele is , or rather was a naïve young womanembarking on an intensely mind blowing sexual relationship with Greyand the casting really does not work . In fact several sexually chargedscenes are unintentionally funny and will cause howls of laughter asthe two leads spout their lines before engaging in sex . Add to this asa possible love rival in the form of Jack Hyde as played by EricJohnson and you've got a hat trick of actors with the sexual charismaof drowned haddock . Casting Kim Basinger in a small role makes thingsworse because you're reminded of her on screen chemistry with MickeyRourke in 91/2 WEEKS which while not being a great film did have anerotic quality to it and despite some fairly explicit sex scenes for amainstream Hollywood movie in 50 SHADES DARKER it's fairly devoid oferotica
