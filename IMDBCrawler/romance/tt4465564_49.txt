I have read the 50 shades series a few times. It's no literarymasterpiece but I really enjoyed it. I saw the first movie in theatersand was totally disappointed but the trailer for this movie made methink it was going to be better. It wasn't. The scenery was beautifuland the soundtrack was great but the acting and story line were totalcrap. Scenes that are supposed to be totally intense are monotone andboring. This story is supposed to be filled with emotion. It's supposedto have screaming and yelling, fighting and making up. It's supposed tobe intense. Instead all you get are a ton of scenes with boobs and theactor supposedly having sex with his pants on. People like this storybecause it's a bit kinky but it's still a story that needs to be told.I felt they left out pretty much everything that makes this storylikable and what was left barely made sense. If you haven't read thebooks you most likely won't know what's going on. Just for reference the theater was mostly empty. Maybe 20 peoplewatching on opening weekend Saturday night. Several people keptchecking their phones and one lady was asleep when the lights came onat the end. They fooled my twice. I won't be back to see any futuremovies from this story line. I'm sad that they screwed this story up sobadly.
