Frankly, do you call this a movie or soft porn that promotes maledomination and humiliates women? Wasted my money and time by watchingthis movie just because some of my friends wanted to watch it badly.This movie just pollutes the minds of our younger generation.Everything from dialogues, sex scenes and acting is poor. The music wasa bit good for which I gave one star. Honestly we women are not likethis. We also like to have good, clean and natural relationships in ourlife. We don't always want to get wet and indulge in a submissiverelationship. Fifty shades of grey started it and now this title madeit worst further. Please come up with some good story-line. Thumbsdown. It only frustrated me and nothing else.
