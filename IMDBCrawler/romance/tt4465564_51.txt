Bad acting, barely any plot, shallow and meaningless conversations withhardly any background and poor dialogue lines. Nothing tends to have aconnection and all scenes lead up to some "wild sadist experience"which furthermore then lead up to more "wild sadist experiences".If there was no sexual content in the movie it would be a movie about arich "sadist" with an insanely ridiculous relationship history marryinga woman who somehow bluntly accepts everything and has an IQ of about60. Oh yea, and some guy harasses her at work and her bf's copteralmost crashes.I can't believe anyone would be buying in to this shallow disaster.Could've been 10 minutes long.Boohoo.
