Contains spoilerThe first movie was so so, i would have given it three stars, but i didnot really like the first book all that much either. This movie saddensme. Darker was my favorite book. Christians evolvement, Ana was moreconfident. There was so much emotion in the book. There was no emotionin this movie. They rewrote every scene where they could have made itso good with the original scene from the book. I was most disappointedby the scene where Ana says she can't be everything Christian needs,with the proposal and all, because that was my favorite scene from thebook. They wrecked it. Like every movie it has it's moments but theyare very few. Still going to watch the third one though..
