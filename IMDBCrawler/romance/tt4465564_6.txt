Stars Minnesota Johnson as the submissive girlfriend and JamieDoorknob, as the dominant, controlling boyfriend. This is soft-coreporn for girls and I noticed that the screening I attended was almostentirely a female audience. Though be aware that the erotic scenes arenot the kind of sex girls want to see or probably enjoy. I didn't care about the lead actors, who had very little chemistry inbetween the sex scenes and even those were pretty dull, the elevatorscene is a good example of what I mean. The plot is poor, the drama is rubbish, the acting is wooden, and thedialogue is laughable rubbish. The film is unintentionally funny whensupposed to be serious, and boring when supposed to be sexy. Althoughsexier than the original film (my wife tells me) not as graphicallysexy as the book. I sat through the pain of this and at the end feltglad I wasn't Christian Grey, though being a billionaire is always veryappealing. So in summary, this is a rubbish sequel to the original garbage butwill do very well because it's been released over the limited windowcoinciding with the Valentine's period.
