Everyone likes to dump on this movie. Many of the references are fromthe first. I think people forget the dynamic. The movie is supposed tobe about somebody very damaged and somebody not so damaged falling inlove. Not a difficult concept. Yes, its kinda weird. Yes, I do wishthat the script was 1000 times better. All in all, I've seen AdamSandler movies that were much worse than this movie. I think the scriptfor The Last Airbender was worse than this. I thought that this moviewas actually a little refreshing after the last. Though, the last movieseemed to have a better script.
