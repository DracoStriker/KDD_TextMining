So, to start off this review, I have to say that you NEED to watch thefirst part to be able to fully understand this second part of the'Fifty shades' movie series. Also, if you're interested in thesereviews, first check those previous ones, in order to compare. Ibelieve that the actors acted much more 'mature' in this movie, theyseemed a lot more natural and chill, unlike in the first part, wherethey seemed kind of 'reserved'. This movie also has a much better, moreextensive and in-depth plot. It's not based only on their relationshipand their sexual relations, but on some other people's problems andsome side effects. The crew decided to spice it all up with a bit ofdrama. To sum the plot up, it's very interesting, different andintense. The reason why I rated this one better than the first one isalso because this part is much more pleasant to watch, made without toomany 'detailed' sex scenes. There is a perfect number of those scenes,few of them, just enough to connect with the previous movie but alsodiffer from it. It's more erotic, romantic, and more quality after all.I suppose I said it all. Opinions on these movie series vary a lot, soit's up to you to watch it and make up your mind about it. I LOVED IT:)
