I have read all 3 books multiple times because the story is THAT GOOD!That being said, they did not catch one tiny inkling of the true storyin either of these movies. There is zero chemistry between the leads.They went so far off the true story it isn't even believable and I justcannot believe how bad the acting is!! No wonder people make fun of themovie. The story has potential to be a very twisted yet enthralling love storybut sadly it is filled with boring sex scenes and cheesy acting. Thescene where Christian thinks Anna is leaving and he gets on his kneesand shuts down. It the book it is dramatic and sad and had me in tears.In the movie, I laughed through it because it was that bad!!Sometimes I think if porn movies had more of a plot they might be alittle more interesting but after seeing this, I guess not!Thanks for destroying up my favorite books.
