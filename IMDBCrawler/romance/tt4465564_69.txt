I have seen bad movies lately, but Fifty Shades Darker would be on thetop of my list. Despite the meaningless story, nothing is properlydone, from acting, to production and direction... it is very cheap byall meaning. There are movies that have bad scripts but nice costumes,bad actors but great lines, bad cinematography but great leadingactors, bad lines but great cinematography. Those movies are bad butworth watching. This film is just bad. And not just bad, but worthless.I am sure that many people cared enough to express theirdisappointment, And the funny thing, they expect to go with anotherepisode, from what the end tells...
