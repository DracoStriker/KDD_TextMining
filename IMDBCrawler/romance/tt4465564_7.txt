While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confrontthe anger and envy of the women who came before her. There was at leasta 5% inside my brain that hoped to find something good in this wholemess or at least for this movie to be a bit decent, unfortunately thisis one of the worst films of 2017 at least so far with some of the mostboring sex scenes i have ever seen, awful dialogue and really weirdsense of humor and the 2 main stars had an on/off kind of chemistryplus that helicopter sequence looked a bit decent in the trailer so iwon't lie on that but in the actual movie it was painful to sit threw.This movie uses lines such as "Kinky F*ckery" and thinks that it'sfunny or smart but it's not it's funny in a very different kind of way.Overall at the end of the day this 'Fifty Shades of Grey' sequel waseven worse than the original with horrible acting, plot and charactersthat are abusive and creepy as hell and i'm still wondering how KimBasinger went from Batman and L.A Confidential to 'Fifty Shades Darker'but hey look at the good side of things this Franchise is so bad thatwe can make fun of it every day but if you did liked the first film youwill probably like this one as well but for everyone else? STAY AWAY!!!(0/10)
