This one... The problem is they portray men as weak unless they areconstantly having sex, and women are weak if they're not always bendingto their partner's every will. They say BDSM should always be flauntedand proud of. It's also offensive to rape victims. You know how abuseand rape should be treated with care and respect? Well, this messesthat up. It basically says that if you walk in on your parents havingsex, you've been raped and scarred for life. That is stupid. So becausethis guy walked in on his parents having sex, he has to abuse hisgirlfriend in order to get it up? I mean, who needs a loving, caring,stable, healthy relationship when you can have glorified rape? Thesoundtrack is terrible, the acting is terrible, the whole "MasqueradeBall" thing reminds me of gross underground human trafficking dungeons,the messages are terrible, the characters are terrible, and the factthat this started as a Twilight fan fiction is kind of speaking forit's quality. And the worst thing is, this setup would have worked ifit was a horror movie. But this is a romance that glorifies rape andpokes fun at actual rape victims. It says that the ideal man is astraight, rich, white guy who abuses his girlfriend. Do not watch this.Watch Lego Batman, Beauty and the Beast, Kong: Skull Island, paint dry,anything is better.
