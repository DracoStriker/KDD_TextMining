Even if this sounds super pretentious, I think it wasn't that hard tomake this a good movie. Put some kind of meta-level in there, don'ttake yourself so serious in every scene of this movie (there are timesin this movie where the serious tone was right but so many scenes couldhave been a little bit more lighthearted and not so try hard heavy) andhave "better" music, so this doesn't look like a music video (I'mlooking at you, boat scene).
