needs improving. I don't get why they can't get better scripts andbetter acting for movies about such famous books. But still I thinkthis sequel was a little better than the first film, which rarelyhappens. I just thought the story was a little better and not so silly.One part that I didn't like was how the helicopter crash was neverexplained, how did the copter not burst into flames. Can't stand plotholes like that. And the petty Elena character was written so silly,why would she care about Ana?FINAL VERDICT: OK, but still probably only for fans of the books.
