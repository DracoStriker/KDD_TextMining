What's so new in this installment? Instead of a airplane, we now have aship. We now have a shower scene in lieu of bathtub. The soundtrack andstyle isn't great as "Love Me like You Do" but ZAyn and Swift score wasthe only highlight. It has nothing of much substance and you canactually find sexier things on GoT!
