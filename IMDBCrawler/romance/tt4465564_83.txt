Unlike most people, I actually found the first Fifty Shades movie,"Fifty Shades of Grey," enjoyable in a "it's so bad that it's good"kinda way and honestly I was hoping for more of the same.Unfortunately, what we actually get is a long overly melodramatic mess.The biggest offense of the film is the writing. It feels as if the bookwas used in place of a script. So almost every mundane and uselessmoment is kept in. And us as the audience suffer because we have to sitthrough a longer run time with not much happening. Also for a moviethat marketed itself on being sexy and taboo, it's quite mild. The mostintense they get is a couple of spank scenes that ultimately end inmissionary and a cut away to them naked in bed. Because of the terriblewriting in the film, the actors don't have much to work with and as aresult they give embarrassingly bad performances. Their line deliveryfeels unnatural and awkward because literally no one talks like that inreal life and I feel like the actors realized it, but went along for afat paycheck. The soundtrack and style isn't bad, but with so muchnonsense going on around, they do nothing to make the experienceenjoyable, instead I was thinking about which songs I can add to myplaylist. In short, "Fifty Shades Darker" is a long drawn outmelodramatic soap opera that managed to become a feature length filmthat takes itself too seriously. It has nothing of substance and youcan actually find sexier things on television. I give it 2/5
