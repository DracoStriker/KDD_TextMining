Dakota Johnson is far the worst actress ever. Plot is horrible also buther acting is another level. wrong cast totally!!!! I can't say what isthe worst in this film... plot, actors , lack of chemistry. Dakota -totally totally wrong choice. This is more worse than part 1. I didn'texpect anything and that's what I got.
