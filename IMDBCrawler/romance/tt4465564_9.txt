Wow what a disappointment !! I personally loved the books ,i saw theback story behind all the sex of a broken man finding and learning tolove really beautiful. The movie , well there are so many things wrongwith it starting with the cinematography ,it's just all too perfectHollywood and not enough rawness and realness to it and i hate it .Nextis the cast i mean i love Jamie Dornan and Dakota is OK but they wereso not right for this movie!No chemistry or heat between them and verywooden analytical acting.Jamie Dornan in The Fall was awesome by theway i am not a hater.Other cast also was wrong from Elana to Mia and soon.The movie also seems very rushed ,I know it is an adaptation of thebook but not done smoothly in my opinion , It makes me really sad asthese movies could have been great if only they had gotten it right,Take a page out of "Nick Cassavetes" book because he directed TheNotebook perfectly.
