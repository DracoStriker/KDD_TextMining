(First review)OK, I know having to much sexual content make the criticism on a moviehard, but sexy scenes aside, this movie made me feel... and that thepoint, I don't care about the story the characters and all the thingsthat goes into making a movie, the only thing I care about is "did thismovie make me invested in it?" hell ya, so the bottom line I loved themovie so much I created an account on IMDb (old fan here) just to saydon't just look at the rating, this movie will own you, P.S. (You NEED to see the first one, it's a must) thanks
