I hadn't seen the original movie, but I didn't care at all because Iknew this would be bad either way. So this movie features the maincharacter Anastasia trying to get back with her boyfriend, ChristianGrey. There's a bunch of other stuff that happens like how he becomesher boss and their family and exes get in their way. This movie was soboring I just found myself trying to think of anything else. I realizeI'm extremely critical of movies that are flat out boring. I said that"Caligula" would be the only porn movie I ever saw in my life and Ithink I broke that rule.This film has four sex scenes in it. I don't know if there's some kindof rule that a film has to have a certain amount of nudity to beconsidered a porn film. This probably does qualify and it's as trashyas any other porn film. The movie shows no graphic depiction ofgenitalia. Could they even get away with that in an R-rated film? Theyknow that rating a movie NC-17 is the absolute guarantee your film willfail. Should they have gone all the way? It's all rather pointless.I guess I'll make an exception for not reviewing porn if it happens tobe very well distributed or is something you would see in a movieguide. The only time I actually noticed something going on was when agunshot occurred. The original was based on a Twilight fanfic and Idon't know if there was a sequel made that was film was based on. Okay,when the fic was adapted into a book, they probably make a book sequel.Can't we get stuff based on good fanfics? Look up "Harry Potter And TheMethods Of Rationality" for something good. This is what we get forobsessing over porn on the Internet. *
