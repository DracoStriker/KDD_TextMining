While the first movie was bad in my opinion ... the second was worse!It was too abrupt and key scenes were removed from the movie ... thismade watching the movie extremely ridiculous ... considering thesequences looked abrupt and meaningless ... while I am not a fan of theFSOG series ... making a movie from a book is tricky and this was amega fail! Don't waste your money going to the theater for this ..there was no head and tail for most scenes! For example: The HelicopterCrash, Ana's Yes, Reunion, etc. Just about everything looked likescenes were chopped and put together for two hours but don't make anysense!
