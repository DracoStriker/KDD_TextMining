Listen, I'm not a movie guru, I don't study arts, I'm just your averageJoe that loves movies. I've seen lots of movies, I don't discriminate,terror, drama, action, animated you name it, I can perfectlydifferentiate between a bad from a good movie, I don't need the biasedcomments of the so called movie critics on IMDb. Thanks God I didn'tpay attention to all the misguided comments about this movie, NocturnalAnimals is a beautiful & stylish movie, great photography, solid actingand a solid plot that will stay with you long after you finish it. Idon't understand why there's so much envy and hate in the filmindustry, the wannabe movie critics can't take that a guy who came fromthe fashion world actually can created a pretty good movie. My fellowreader, please don't miss the chance to see this movie.
