Nocturnal Animals is a dark and devilishly stylish thriller from TomFord, who knows a thing or two about style having worked as creativedirector for both Gucci and Yves Saint Lauren in the past. It couldhave been in danger of being a case of style over substance however,Ford's perfectionism makes this one of the most powerful films I'veseen all year.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is an art gallery owner who spends most of herlife at home alone, with her husband often out of town on business.When Susan receives a manuscript to a novel written by her ex-husband,Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), she finds herself immediatelyengrossed.As Susan continues to read the novel, she has flashbacks to how herrelationship with Edward broke down as well as thoughts that theviolent thriller is a veiled threat against her from Edward.I didn't know what to expect from Nocturnal Animals as I hadn't seenany trailers and Ford's film ended up blowing me away. The way Fordtells the story showcases how inventive and powerful he is as afilmmaker, the narratives of both Susan's life and Edward's novelcombining brilliantly and leaving me in a trance like state.Edward's novel provides the film with its dark soul, the story of TonyHastings (also played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and his family who run intotrouble when travelling through the night on the road to their countryhome. It's pretty heavy stuff but it plays an essential part in makingthis such powerful viewing.This is a gorgeous film to look at as well, Seamus McGarvey'scinematography echoing the story's bleakness and the brutality ofEdward's supposed veiled threat to Susan. The combination of thevisuals with Abel Korzeniowski's dream-like score heightens the senseof escapism felt by Susan as she reads Edward's novel.Coming to the performances, Nocturnal Animals features a veryimpressive ensemble cast all at the top of their game. Amy Adams yetagain proves why she's one of the most versatile actresses with aperformance that combines the assurance of an art gallery owner withthe vulnerability of someone who knows they've made mistakes in theirpast. With this and Arrival out in the coming months, expect to seeAdams get some form of recognition come the awards season, maybe forboth.Adams is joined by Jake Gyllenhaal, who takes on dual roles yet againfor this film. Gyllenhaal has really grown as an actor, particularly inthe last five years, and its great to see him continue that inNocturnal Animals, more notably in the role of Tony Hastings, acreation of his other character Edward. The rest of the cast features a scene stealing Michael Shannon, whoI've really grown to appreciate these last few years, a career bestperformance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is truly vile as thevillainous Ray, and Laura Linney who, even in the short space of timewe see her, makes one hell of an impact.I cannot speak highly enough of Nocturnal Animals, a stylish thrillerthat has more than enough substance to it. I will definitely bechecking out Tom Ford's A Single Man after this and I sure as hell hopewe see more work from Ford in the future.
