What can I say about this movie? I think it's overrated, over-hyped,and overpraised. I believe media loves this movie because they'reactually praising Tom Ford the stylist, not Tom Ford the filmmaker. The movie undeniably has good qualities - beautiful cinematography,lavish costume design, amazing cast (Michael Shannon's performance isflawless and deserves an Academy Award).However, the screen script is weak, pretentious and childish. The bookwritten by Tony Hastin looks more interesting than the movie itself. Idon't understand the need to tell a story inside a story when the mainstory line is weak, full of clichés and unconvincing. The love story between Susan and Edward didn't convince me at all. Itall seemed very poorly developed, the flashback moments were cold, theyalways seemed like two teenagers speaking - no substance, no deepness,nothing that Tom Ford's target audience would expect, I believe. Edward's little plot of revenge is absurdly childish, also laughable.That's why the character is not convincing to me. It's all absurdlyimmature. Honestly, I believe Tom Ford was more worried about making a visuallyimpacting movie than actually a good one. He has yet a lot to learnabout what is necessary to be a good filmmaker.
