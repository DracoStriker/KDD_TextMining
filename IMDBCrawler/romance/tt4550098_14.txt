Just got back from the theater. Don't understand the rating. Readingthe reviews ... I feel lonely. I feel like these critics got their jobtoo easy, or by scheming, or by sheer luck. Am I the only one wholaughed out loud when Tony shot himself in the groin? Or when he,blinded by a well deserved blow to the head, stumbled out of thetrailer? For those of you who think that I didn't understand the innerturmoil of the writer pictured there as a physical struggle.. let meput your mind at ease. I did and so should everyone, because this movieis a like a fake easy test you get just to feel good about yourself. Nothanks. After twenty years this is his revenge? Showing her that hewrote a crap book? Making her feel alone, left behind, like he feltback then? Making her understand what he has been through, what shemissed? Big whoop, she already knew and beside hurting a bit she didn'tdo anything about it. You know, like in real life. Tom Ford, master ofthe cinema verite.I have a fun fact for you: did you know that when Ray is sitting on thetoilet outside, and the cop tells him to get dressed, he wipes his asswith a page of the script? True story.Joking aside, there is so much "The emperor's new clothes" thing goingon in the movie business nowadays that my head hurts.Anyway, trashing this flick is the only thing that makes me feel betterafter losing 4 bucks to this writer , director , fashion designer, liontamer, electrician, etc, so I'm sorry if I upset anybody who was deeplymoved by his movie, and will forever remember it as one of great piecesof cinema.In all honesty, there are so many movies more deserving of goodreviews, and it is sad that we don't have smarter critics.
