The second film from designer turned directory Tom Ford was not just avisual masterpiece but had great narrative. The plot of the movie whichis three narratives combined into one and tells the story of SusanMorrow (Amy Adams) an art gallery owner who receives a manuscript ofher ex-husband's (Jake Gyllenhaal) thriller novel dedicated to her. Theway that the story was told was bold, strange and very unique to me.Even though a movie with three narratives might sound clumsy but itwasn't, the stories of different time lines did not overlap each otherrather it made the story complete with showing different aspects of thecharacters.Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance as Ray Marcus was definitely myfavorite, he was so creep and repulsive to watch. The brilliant MichaelShannon was also in this movie as Bobby Andes with great Oscar worthyperformance. Overall, I loved this movie for it's visual look andappeal of it's leading characters. While I was watching the movie Iliked Tom Ford's directing style, storytelling, cinematography andafter watching it I started to think about it while connecting the dotsbetween the different narratives and it easily became my favorite movieto think about. If you really like movies that makes you think andeventually re-watch them over again then this movie is for you.
