This film was a wonderful exhibition of acting and cinematography. Youcan clearly see the work of Tom Ford in it and there are many thingsthat draw comparisons to his debut film 'a single man.' Stylisticallyit is similar, most notably through the musical score. What impressedme most about it was the symbolism of the book that Amy Adams reads.You can clearly see that the wife of Tony represents Amy Adams'character in real life and what she used to be, from Edward'sperspective. The character of Ray Marcus seems to represent what Susanthen became from Edwards perspective after the terrible things she didto him. Ford also drops various visual cues in the story, such as thered couch that he finds his dead wife and daughter on, that representthings in the real-life narrative. Overall, the film was a technicalwonder. The only reason I couldn't rate it higher was because thescript didn't quite match the other aspects of the film and the themesthe film was trying to explore were unclear. However, the film remainsa harrowing piece of work and a great second feature film by Tom ford.
