At the outset, i should make it clear that i don't think this is a badfilm, but i felt the need to add a dissenting voice to the collectionof positive reviews that i've read so far.The film is an amalgamation of elements that should work beautifully,but ultimately resembles one of the sterile offerings to be found inSusan's gallery. The acting is superb throughout, and the nuancedperformances of Amy Adams & Jake Gyllenhaal are worthy of theirreputations. The subtle transitions from dead and lifeless to young andvibrant, exhibited by the former at various stages of the film, is oneof the most striking features of the piece. The film is beautifullyshot and well directed, and there are some truly moving scenes inparts. However, as one reviewer has already alluded to, the film feelslike it is desperate to say something, but ultimately says very little.Perhaps i just didn't get it at all.The problem i had was with a lack of emotional connection to either ofthe main protagonists. It's interesting to find out what happens toboth as the film builds, but ultimately i didn't care either way.My partner and i spent some time examining the film on the way home,discussing the parallels between the story at the heart of the film,and the realities that continue around it, but despite our rudimentaryanalysis of what each one meant for the other, and an understandingthat there are some clever parallels, what remained was the underlyingsense of "so what?".
