Probably the most unsatisfying movie of the year. This was justterrible. This movie could have been so much more...it had all theright elements put together in the right place to make the perfectthriller. And yet, when it came to those final moments were theaudience expects it to deliver, to satisfy the viewer; it just turnsinto a royal/classy/elegant piece of turd with zero substance of aclimax.If you want to feel like banging your face on to the screen andexperience how it feels to absolutely destroy 2hrs of your life, goahead and watch this absolute nonsense of a movie.
