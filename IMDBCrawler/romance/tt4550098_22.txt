You know those movies that you are angry at when they end because youcan't get those 2 hours of your life back? Well, this is one of them. Icould even give this a one word review but IMDb need 10 lines and thatone word may be deemed offensive to some readers.This... film... is more like a poor, over-budgeted tele-drama. But Iguess it makes a lot of sense, as the film actually looks like it wasmade by a fashion designer; it is highly stylised, even slick buttotally lacking in substance. The exchange of dialogue, meaning and any chemistry between charactersof the more than capable cast (I really dig Jake Gyllenhall) wasslaughtered by what appeared to be the director's obsession controllingeach and every frame, resulting in jerky and awkward delivery.Also, this film ain't no thriller. There's even a cheap stunt employedthat only the most b-grade non-thrillers pull: the quick flash of ascary image that's out of place to scare the bejesus out of you.Ridiculous.Apart from the annoying directorial anal retentiveness rendering theactor's performance insincere, the story is just so totally and utterlyimplausible and leaves you feeling empty. While the book it's based onmay be a story your imagination could bring to life, clearly Tom'simagination is either severely lacking or he's a huge fan of Days OfOur Lives.
