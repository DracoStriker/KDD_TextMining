As Tom Hanks' character in Big would say: "I don't get it". Why anyoneis talking about this film in terms of awards flummoxes me.This awful film wasn't helped by the marketing blurb that made it soundlike it was a thriller in which the main female lead is worried abouther ex plotting revenge. It was nothing of the sort. If she was evenslightly worried I couldn't tell. I guess him sending her his awfulbook was revenge enough in itself.The scenes in which the dreary woman moped about reading the book justmade the film longer and increasingly dull. Maybe they were supposed tobe art masquerading as cinematography? The best bits were thedramatization of the book. Tom Ford might learn some useful lessons bywatching some of Peter Greenaway's films.There was an excess of style of substance. What was the point of thecorpulent women at the start? Or the nonsense in the pseudo-artgallery? This film was made by an aspiring artist - but not astoryteller. It was completely unsatisfying and I loathed it. If I hadgone to the cinema on my own I would have walked out - it was that bad.It's a pity I can't award zero stars.
