Being unhappy and confused despite excess wealth is not within mypersonal experience, and this film did not enlighten me as to the rootcauses of unhappiness in any form. The slow pace of this story turnedme off within minutes. The confusing and frequent flashbacks indicatesto me that there really is no worthwhile story to tell. The gratuitousnudity is unnecessary and too brief to be exciting. The writing incontrast to the stark visuals is as flabby as the women in the openingscenes. Adultery by a spouse claiming to be traveling for business iscliché as is the aggrieved spouse's denial. The lack of compellingstory probably increased pop corn sales.
