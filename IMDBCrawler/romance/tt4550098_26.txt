Beautiful, artful, well acted revenge upon each movie goer who receivesa blast to the unconscious of unmitigated sadistic satisfaction fromthe filmmaker. Triumph is: First, I shocked you into disgust, thenlured you deeper with artful beauty; then left you full of my need forrevenge upon the consumer for whom I have contempt. He was correct: heknew the excellent performances, richly told, indigestible tale with noredemption would keep us in our seats based on earlier work of "Asingle Man". I'm guessing, some feel it is Shakespearean. I'd ratherread the Marquis de Sade for the real thing. An artful blending of anovel telling and the reader who is lured (as is the viewer) into adrama meant only to evacuate the spleen of of the filmmaker and mortifythe viewers -it works for the filmmaker/writer as he has the controlover the deepest layers of the story which may leave him/them in astate of control, while we have been the mortified objects of hisevacuation. This is a haute couturier's horror film. Period.
