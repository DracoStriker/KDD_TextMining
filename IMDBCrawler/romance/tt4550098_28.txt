Spoiler alert....Please don't read if u haven't seen themovie....So...here is what i think of the plot.Susan left Edwardchasing something bigger.Edward used to call her Nocturnal Animal whilethey were together.She left him and she also had an abortion on hisbabe.Edward could do nothing but watching her leaving and killing thefamily they could have.So the novel he sent to her is really aboutthem.About her.And this explains the title of the novel.Tony,the maincharacter of the novel is really Edward who watches his family takenaway by 3 Nocturnal Animals(Suzan) and get killed while he can donothing.At the end he finds the strength to kill those animals but hekills himself too.But the some seems to have happened to Edward...inhis real life....He can't forgive Susan ...his own Nocturnal Animal.Heseeks for revenge ...revenge Suzan who left him and revenge himself whodid nothing...That's why he never shows up at the end of the movie atthe restaurant.He has killed Susan inside him but since she was hisonly and true love of his life .living her alone in the restaurant eventhough she wanted a second chance with him ,this really kills himtoo.Concerning Susan...she realizes that the real revenge is not onlyfrom Edward but by herself too.When she watches the phone video of hercolleague's baby she drops the phone because she saw one of the 3nocturnal animals there.Of course the murderer was never there but thatwas symbolic about how she murdered her own baby when she had thatabortion.Because she was the Nocturnal Animal of her own life...So thereal revenge and the worse is realizing at some point of your life thatu lost real happiness chasing something bigger but Utopia.Chasinghappiness sometimes is like salt water...the more u drink the more uget thirsty
