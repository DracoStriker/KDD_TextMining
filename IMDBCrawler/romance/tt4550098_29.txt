Yesterday I saw this movie and Arrival, then. First Nocturnal Animalsand then Arrival. I stayed in the cinema for 4 hours in a row. I hadnot done this for years. Arrival had potential. But from the middle ofthe film, this potential has been spoiled. And it gave rise to amediocre movie. Nothing special except for the technical part.Nocturnal Animals has no potential. It's a mediocre movie frombeginning to the very end. The viewer knows how the film unfolds, howthe characters will react (put famous actors, also takes the charm ofthe film away, because we know how these actors will react, becausethese actors are pretty well known and this removes in a way thefeeling of discovery). There is no potential here to develop theimagination, everything in this film is made in the laboratory with noroom for anything else. Except for some scenes of nudity and violence.A supermarket method to cover something too banal. I could mention thesymbolic aspect of the movie. But I always find the Symbolists andtheir way of thinking too limited and a waste of time that does notenrich anything in the film. A useless gimmick that just makes peoplethink in a gratuitous way, What matters, if Amy Adams's character isseated on a red couch, a red couch where the female characters in thebook story line are found dead after being raped. It's just uselesssituations that make you think only in these situations and not in themovie itself. I will not waste any more time on this mediocre movie.
