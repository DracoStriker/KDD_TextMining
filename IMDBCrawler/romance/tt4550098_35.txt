The plot.A "story inside a story," in which the first part follows a woman namedSusan who receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband, a man whomshe left 20 years earlier, asking for her opinion. The second element follows the actual manuscript, called "NocturnalAnimals," which revolves around a man whose family vacation turnsviolent and deadly. It also continues to follow the story of Susan, who finds herselfrecalling her first marriage and confronting some dark truths aboutherself.Amy Adams should be bagging at the local grocery store. She cannot act.She instantly brings the movie down. The film is poorly constructed and dumb. The dialog is idiotic. Howthis movie gets over a 7 review rating is beyond me.Watching this confusing poorly constructed fiasco is a complete wasteof time.
