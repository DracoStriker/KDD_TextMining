Greetings from Lithuania."Nocturnal Animals" (2016) is one of the most strangest movies I'veseen in a while. I liked what i saw, but i didn't get it at the end.There are two stories here, one with a women and her surrounding in asome sort of fashion world, where great actors like Michael Sheen popup on screen for 2 minutes and then disappears. The other is about thesame woman reading a book sent by her ex husband which contains agritty story totally different from our prime story. Or isn't? I lovedthe second story, which could have (and did work) as a superb thriller.Performances in a "second" story were great by everyone involved,especially by a great Michael Shannon who won Oscar nomination here -superb acting. But i wasn't confused when even he suddenly disappearedfrom screen - this happened a lot in this movie. So you think these twostories will collide somehow by the end? Well if they did, i didn't getit.Overall, i was involved into "Nocturnal Animals" for its good script(but not a story overall), absolutely superb performances and very goodcinematography. But i didn't get the outcome. If there even was one...
