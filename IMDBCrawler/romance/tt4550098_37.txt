Nocturnal Animals is a beautiful movie in many ways, but it is alsosomewhat of an acquired taste. If someone were to come up to me and say"I hated this movie" I would completely understand. The subject matteris vile and harsh, the images contained are violent, ugly, offensiveand hateful. Still, sometimes ugliness can be beautiful and thecontrast of fashion designer Tom Ford's images are totally effective.Some of the most well dressed, beautiful people and locations are ondisplay in this desert mystery about a book reading that imitates theformer marriage of Amy Adams character. Which part of the movie is realand which part is imagined, or is it all just a horrible nightmare?
