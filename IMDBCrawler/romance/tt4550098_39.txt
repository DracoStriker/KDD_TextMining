NOCTURNAL ANIMALS (2016) *** Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, MichaelShannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Ellie Bamber, Armie Hammer,Karl Glusman, Robert Aramayo, Laura Linney, Michael Shannon, JenaMalone, Kristin Bauer van Straten. Overcooked wanna be noir fromfilmmaker Tom Ford who's flashy style over substance adaptation ofAustin Wright's novel - tends to supersede the otherwise fair at bestand overrated at most display of decent acting by a top-notch cast inan otherwise B-movie film circa 1961: to wit -- icily off-putting artgallery proponent Adams faces a few hurdles including her dyingmarriage to wooden Hammer and a new wrinkle : ex-husband Gyllenhaal'ssudden re-entrance via a new manuscript that appears to have agenuinely unsettling affect on her psyche. The back-and-forth fromreality to the pouring outs of the novel are indeed novel but again theactors summoned give it their all particularly Shannon (copping arichly deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) as theunspooling murder mystery's cancer-stricken lawman hellbent on solvinga viciously violent final case at any cost.
