First you get hit with the first 3-5 minutes of 400Lb obese females infull nudity dancing and throwing their parts at you and then watch themin laying positions in a art show! Almost walked out at that point (andshould have). The story then breaks down into 3 sub-plots betweencurrent time, her past with her former husband, and the time within themanuscript she was reading. The only redeeming value of the whole moviewas the plot when she was reading the story - we all like hearing agood story right? But it stops with that being the only part that wasany good. The movie drags in many spots. Very little time to show muchif any of Amy Adams' usually good acting ability. Fifteen minutes ofgood watching scattered within an hour and a half of garbage still leftme wishing I would have walked out at the beginning porn shots. Don'twaste your time.
