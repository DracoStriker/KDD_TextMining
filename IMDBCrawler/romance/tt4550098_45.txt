I have already seen this film 3 times, and it still holds up incrediblywell. This may have to do with the fact that this movie is a oneheart-piercing experience to go through. It is also one of those filmsthat may differ your entire experience on the second watch, so youwould want to see it again. 'Nocturnal Animals' may have been a simple revenge story in an unusualmanner, but what makes it truly stand out from all of the recentlyreleased movies is its fantastic presentation, which can be describedas a perfect blend between drama and thriller. The film never lets youget bored. Instead, it has you on the edge of the seat for almost theentirety of its runtime, thanks to being filled with situations thatare remarkably realistic, stressful, and believable.Even without all the tension that 'Nocturnal Animals' can offer, it hasvery unique structure of storytelling that you probably haven'tencountered in any film before. This method was no doubt quitechallenging to transfer from script to screen so that it would worksuccessfully and without any complications, but in the end it workedand it worked brilliantly.Because of how the story is told, I think everybody's going to takesomething different away from the film. It's one of those things whereyou see the film and then you get to talk about it for days and weeksto come, and those, for me, are the best kind of films, the films thatstay with you. And this film definitely stays with you.The unforgettable atmosphere that the film creates, its convincing andmemorable characters, humble and grounded way of showing something soexceptional, and devastating resolution is what makes 'NocturnalAnimals' such a great film that really sticks to you after you watchit. It is, at the very least, worth checking out, and even if you thinkthis movie isn't really for you, you still have all the chances to endup loving it.
