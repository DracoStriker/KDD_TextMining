I will admit that I'm a sucker for this type of film. Multiplenarratives, brooding violent thriller, polished 80's De Palma-esque..yea, definitely a kid in the candy store moment.Nocturnal Animals is very clever. It uses one narrative to express thefeelings of the characters in another. Ford's film looks absolutely fantastic. The pacing is perfect. I knownot everyone will love it, mostly because it does not have acookie-cutter Hollywood payoff. The shock-symbolism of the openingcredits may be a bit much for some too - even me. It's like 1998's"Great Expectations" met 2016's "Hell or High Water". Speaking of, itjust moved into the #2 spot ahead of the latter, as the 2nd best filmI've seen from last year, 54 films through a watchlist of 89 films. Itis fresh in my mind so I could flip-flop those back later. It willlikely hold a top-5 spot when all is said and done.The film asks a lot of questions about fate, social classes, and thestrength of men. The audience keeps questioning the reality andsignificance of the parallel narrative until after credits role. That'sthe aspect that put this in the 9 range for me.Worth another view, and soon. There's still a few more pieces of thepuzzle I might have missed. A thought provoking, excellent film. Kudosto the entire cast and the director. If you want to watch a sharp,thought provoking thriller, look no further.
