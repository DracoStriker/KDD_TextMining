Potential spoiler ahead... I found this movie to be suspenseful andinteresting to watch. Initially, slow to understand the purpose, alittle bit of bouncing around between fact and fiction within the movieitself, but all makes sense in the end. I also found this movie to beboth frustrating to watch and relatable at the same time in the sensethat if I put myself in the main characters shoes, namely JakeGyllenhaall's fictional character (and by fictional, I mean fictionalwithin the movie). It makes you wonder what you would do in a situationof great stress and threat to your family. The ending is a bit of a"choose your own adventure" type of scenario. It leaves a lot ofunanswered questions, but you are likely to form your own conclusion asto why it ended the way it did. It takes a little bit of thought, butit makes sense. After throwing a small temper tantrum at the end, Idetermined that the reason for the rather abrupt ending was selfevident. Overall, I very much enjoyed the film, and it made me reallythink about what I would do if put in a similar circumstance, both onthe fiction within the fiction side, and within the main characters ofthe movie. That said, I give it a solid 9 out of 10.Let me also add that this movie made me decide that if I ever go on aroad trip with my wife and children, I'm going to either carry a gun,or a long metal object to defend my family!
