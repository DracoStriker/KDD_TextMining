First, the opening scenes of this movie were both startling andmeaningless at the same time. I actually never felt so uncomfortable ina movie theater, and this scene did that for me. I was hoping the restof the movie would be better.I have to admit that the acting was superb, and the cast was amazing,but the movie itself just didn't click for me. Mike Shannon was greatin his role; I was blown away by his acting, but, unfortunately, nothis character. Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal were also great in theirrespective roles as well. Again, the acting was superb, but thecharacters, plot and pace of this movie left little to be desired.Not that I didn't get the drift of the movie,that was quite clear, butI think the movie tried too hard to be clever, and the story lines gotjumbled and diluted because of that fact. The visuals in this movie aredramatic and vivid... but not enough to drag this one out of thebasement. I had to ask myself at the ending if that was "it". Not worththe money and not worth my time.
