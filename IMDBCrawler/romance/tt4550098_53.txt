This movie manages to deliver a brilliant start and intense plotdevelopment. The actors are taking their time to give brilliantperformances. Actually I liked the police officer (Michael Shannon)performance the best. He gives a stunning performance as a taciturnwestern police. His features, reactions, and casualness mixed with theconscientiousness in the job is brilliantly natural.Some reviewers questioned the blurry connection between the book andthe protagonists' lives - I say it wouldn't be necessity. That's how awriter is, he writes whatever he feels, and sometimes the story candevelop far from his(her) own life.Some reviewers said the movie tries hard to deliver a strong message inthe end - a culmination point. Perhaps they have a point. But I say themovie becomes average and boring in the end. Therefore, the hard-triedemotional culmination looks a failure.I wish the ending was a proper justice with hard-triggered squeezes.Especially the police character was ruined - just because he had acancer, his personality should not become compromised.I enjoyed the movie, nevertheless.
