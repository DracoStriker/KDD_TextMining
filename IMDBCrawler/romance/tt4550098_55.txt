We've all had that book that we were addicted to. We read it everychance we could. Further into reading some of us even comparedourselves to the main character. Picturing ourselves as him/her andeventually may even find similarities to them. "Nocturnal Animals" wasSusan's book.This film follows a woman named Susan who receives a book from herex-husband. One element of the film follows the main character in thebook, Tony and how tragedy strikes his family. The other element of thefilm follows Susan and her journey.The editing, cinematography and writing was pretty good. The viewer canfeel the different and sometimes similar tones from Susan's lifecompared to Tony's life. The viewer can also understand the differentemotions the characters were going through. The acting was spot on.Now I'd like to discuss what I think could have been improved in thismovie. The screenplay is based on a novel by Austin Wright. I haven'tread it so I cannot compare. I can say, to me, I felt like I was justwatching them. I didn't connect with them. During the whole movie, myheart didn't race, not once. I feel the writers could have spent moretime establishing ways the viewer could relate to the main characters.I also understood the concepts the themes displayed but I feel theycould have been executed better.Overall the film is okay. At the end of the film I just felt, is thisit? I wouldn't watch it again.
