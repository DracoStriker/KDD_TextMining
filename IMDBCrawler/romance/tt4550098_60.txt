Nocturnal Animals starts out with a blinding display of full nudity anddives into the distraught character played by Amy Adams. She reads abook about a story involving Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannoncharacters that kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire film. Thebad guys are the worst and I hope I never wind up on a long, dark WestTexas road with them especially Aaron Taylor-Johnson (nomination). Irecommend not watching this alone. It was nominated for Best SupportingActor, Director and Screenplay.
