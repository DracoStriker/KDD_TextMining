In a quite unexpected second motion picture, Ford offers a verycontrolled film, mimicking the very characters it is portraying. Fromthe Lynchian opening, to the suspenseful, incredibly crafted, almostHitcockian, action scenes and the evocative colour palette, my eyeswere glued to the screen. Shannon and Gyllenhaal are amazing, but Adamsmanages to instill in the audience a sense of restlessness which fewcould've pulled off. It's amazing how absolutely nothing feels out ofplace, as if Ford was looming behind every shot, every word and everygesture.
