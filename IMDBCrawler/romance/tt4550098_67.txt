"Night Animals" has a charm that few will have the perception tonotice, it's like a shell inside a shell, you have to open it twice,with good performances and great technical resources, with an initialcredit scene that satirizes The American visceral way - althoughdisconnected from the rest of the film - we have here a great workforgotten by the great awards. Contemplate the story of Susan (AmyAdams), who after a painful break with her husband 20 years ago findsherself thinking about him constantly, especially after receiving amanuscript of it. I do not think there is anything that can be claimedabout the plot, because it uses more of the visual subjectivity thanthe script, the script is very self explanatory and even with only twohours of movies, it is enough to develop All the characters, we caneven have a dubio ending that can make us question the quality of it,but after a little reflection, you will give up the questionings. Thefilm has a moral that talks about the weakness of the human being, andweakness here is explored from all sides, from the physical to thespiritual, from the psychological to the emotional, all the charactersat some point experience this weakness (I Talk more about it in thespoiler part), the film also contains several extremely clichécritiques of the American way of life and conservatism. The photographof this film is simply beautiful, with lots of shades of blue and gray,it's a heavy, tense, loaded photograph, and as if it weighed on theshoulders of our characters, with daring camera angles, full of openplans and subjective cameras that Tom brings a lot of interestingangles, and now one thing about the film that touched me, and a lot,its soundtrack, it is so simple and at the same time so complex andlinear, it talks a lot about the movie, and when the We are listening,it is almost an invitation to reflect on what is being shown on screen.We have 2 sensational actors here, who do what they expect in theirroles - although nothing that animates much, although Jake is excellent- these actors are Amy Adams Jake Gylenhaa (who plays 2 differentcharacters), but whoever ends up robbing the screen completely isMichael Shannon and Aaron Taylor- Johnson, with their spectaculardetective and psychopath. Finally, the film of the experimental TomFord completely divides the critical world out, but at least for me,the film is excellent for its simplicity, honesty, clarity and beautyas it deals with its themes. One of the things that divide criticism isits end, and the grace of this end, is that it can be millions ofinterpretations, that's the grace of the art, each one understood in adifferent way, for me, Jake's character only Wanted to show that thatweak part of him no longer exists, he writes the book as a form ofrevenge on the abortion carried out by Susan, because the book talksabout what he went through having lost his daughter, but in anextremely exaggerated way, we have All the stages, pain, suffering,repentance and acceptance, and at the end when Susan invites him to seehim, he will not, because that guy who accepted the suffering caused bySusan dies along with his character in the book.
