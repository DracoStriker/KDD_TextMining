Intense, cold, brutal, cruel, perfectly filmed, acted and strongdialogue. While I know this is based on the novel, "Tony and Susan,"I'm shocked Tom Ford, more known for fashion design, is able to channelhis creative side so well into film-making. The screenplay he writes isvery strong. The tension I felt throughout most of the film is the mostI've truly felt during a movie in years.
