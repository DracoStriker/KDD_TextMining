I tend to like Tom Ford's A Single Man. I was not enraptured, but theleading performers were versatile and great, and so I did not mind tofollow his second film. Perhaps I wanted some development regardingtautness, excitement - but, alas, I did not find. Again, the performers are good, if not great (particularly JakeGyllenhaal, Michael Shannon), and parallel worlds enable witty andsmooth comparisons and similar activities in different time and space,but striving for profundity and artisticness has brought along longstatic scenes and elements difficult to follow, to be read in the plotdescription later on. The novel is not too interesting as a thriller,and the real world is rather boring, forcing me to use forward-functionfrom time to time... No, I am not into flashing lights and actionchases, but seeing a static face for dozens of seconds without anyevent in the background - not for me either.Thus, I got ambivalent feelings, and I do not share the overall praise.Yes, direction is witty, characters distinct, but the two worlds do notform a smooth entirety.
