Nocturnal Animals is a terrific movie with a very well developed plotand an outstanding cast. It is a very engrossing story that is trulytold like no other, it was amazing to see two separate plots in one andhow they interconnected with each other. We follow Susan Morrow, as shereads a book her husband dedicated to her, and also get taken in to thebook itself. The layers to the plot are incredible, and thecinematography used to convey this strange world is magnificent. I was a little disappointed by the conclusion, not that I would havehoped for a better ending, but I just thought it finished veryabruptly. I was surprised when the credits began to roll, I felt likethere was still more to be told, a lot of questions left unanswered. Iwould like to have seen a proper confrontation between Susan andEdward, there is very little scenes with them together, it just left mea little underwhelmed. The cast is all around phenomenal, Amy Adams delivers a rich, somberperformance, Michael Shannon is a rough, shady officer who is veryintriguing to watch as we never know what he is going to do next, andAaron Taylor-Johnson, who steals every scene he is in with hisextremely unlikeable character, very surprising work by him. Thehighlight is without a doubt Jake Gyllenhaal, playing two characters inthis, both with a lot of eloquence. While Tony and Edward are notextremely different, he does enough subtle changes with both parts forus to know the difference, he is absolutely spellbinding in this role,every cast member is doing some of their best work here. A slow moving film that provides the best possible thrills. Terrificdialogue, performances and cinematography, we really see Tom Ford'sunique vision get brought to life here, and I would recommend NocturnalAnimals to anyone looking for a good thriller. A woman gets sent a book by her ex husband that he wrote in dedicationto her, she soon discovers this gesture is not as kind as it may seem. Best Performance: Jake Gyllenhaal
