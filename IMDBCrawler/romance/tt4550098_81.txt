There is no doubt that this is a pretty interesting film and quite surethat many people will enjoy it more than I did.The movie is a story inside a story. Amy Adams plays Susan who isreading a book from her ex husband Edward. Personally I found the bookstory far more engaging and interesting than the real life storyline.For me the real life story felt very cold and unreal. I have no doubtthat many people will find that part of the movie the best, but it justdidn't work for me. The plot line of the book worked a lot better andcreated far more tension.It's undoubtedly a bold movie and should be praised for that. Wellworth a watch.
