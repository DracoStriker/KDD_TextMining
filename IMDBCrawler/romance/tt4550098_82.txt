Everyone is either hating this movie or loving it. To be honest, I wasslightly disappointed because my expectations were very high afterwatching "A Single Man." It wasn't too bad, though. It had thebeautiful cinematography and style, and everything was overdramatic,and I loved it. The transition shots were great and the whole thing hadthat unsettling, sometimes uncomfortable feeling to it. It switched offbetween the novel scenes, the real life scenes, and the flashbacks sosuddenly but it was still clear what was what without clear indicators.Some parts were a little cheese, I'll agree. The soundtrack soundedlike a distant ripoff from "A Single Man." The biggest complaint frompeople was that it was boring and there was no pay off. That wasactually the thing I liked. The boringness of it, the limbo wherenothing really happened. But the way everything was shot was sogorgeous I couldn't look away. At the end, nothing really happenedeither. He didn't show up while she waited and waited. But it wasbeautiful. And that kind of ending was great because not everything hasa resolution, not everything has to have one. I thoroughly enjoyedwatching this. A little disappointed Tom Ford wasn't part of costumedesign, but he did pretty well with everything else.
