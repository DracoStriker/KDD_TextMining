The film contains a complex dramatic story that I wish the directorwould simplify ... The story of Edward Jake (Gyllenhaal divided)between his weak real personality and the weakness of his missingpersonality in Bobby(Michael Shannon) and gave him a sign of weaknessand illness in the real character and how to try to deal with thingsthat Edward is difficult to deal with personally but has beenattenuated as long as she can not find support From within the humansoul (philosophy) I did not find a broad axis of the story other than asimple idea can be summarized in less than an hour and what I mean heredramatic padding And many mirrors in the film make the viewer sharpensthe thought to see what is meant by the mirrors and here the viewer isboring. 6/10 I find reasonable for this work.
