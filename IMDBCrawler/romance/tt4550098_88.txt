I never give a movie a ridiculous rating like 10, but I feel compelledto give it to this one. I know this movie is good because of what itdid to me emotionally. The film's outrageous. It shows that what isreally terrifying is not Satan possessing your child or a murdererkilling you in your nightmares--it's the things that can really happen.Like the Stephen King story "The Ledge".The casting is perfect. The acting is impeccable. The script is almostbeyond improvement. The imagery is especially powerful. The movie evenhas a subtle absurdist humor that made me think of the futility ofhuman endeavors.You probably see that I cannot gush enough over this movie. You need tosee it. Now.
