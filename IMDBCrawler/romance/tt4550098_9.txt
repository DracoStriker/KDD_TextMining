Unfortunately, Nocturnal Animals was completely unbelievable right fromthe beginning, with dialog that seemed written by a machine. Given the'novel' idea, that might have been excused, but all the dialog in thesupposed 'real world' was just as bad. The only actor able to shinethrough this pretentious crap was Michael Shannon, but after a time hischaracter just disappeared from the story. And what was Michael Sheendoing in this movie? And the nude fat dancers? It really added up tonothing. And oh my goodness, what a payback for leaving a man andaborting his child: He got her to go to a dinner meeting AND DIDN'TSHOW UP! Wow! Now that's payback in a BIG WAY! Sorry, but this exercisein audience manipulation was a real disappointment after A Single Man.
