A terrifying and beautiful film about a creative person sublimatingpain the only way they know how. They channel the overwhelming sadnessof loss into their creative work seeking some kind of closure, one thatmay remain elusive nevertheless. At times such a creation never reachesits intended audience. The feeling of guilt can force the one causingpain to run and even suppress any memory of the past into nonexistence.Fortunately, it is not the case with Nocturnal Animals, otherwise we'dnever see her read his story. That would be a sad loss in itself.
