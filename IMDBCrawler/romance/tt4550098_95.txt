Sigh. Maybe I wouldn't be so disappointed in Nocturnal Animals if thetrailers hadn't construed it as some twisted thriller instead of thecharacter study it really is. Tom Ford apparently thinks his audienceis too dense to figure the obvious out on their own, as he practicallybeats you over the head with his "cleverness." Firstly the film'a styleseems forced which makes it come off as pretentious. There is nothingsubtle about this movie. In one scene Susan is looking at a giant muralthat says "Revenge" and talks to a coworker about it. I enjoy movieswhere you catch subtleties throughout, like why couldn't there just bea small picture in the background somewhere that said Revenge? I feellike every time something important was said or shown Ford felt like hehad to point it out so that even the dumbest viewer could have it laidout for them. This movie is in no way a thriller. The beginning wasintense, but afterwards I felt nothing for any of the characters. Itwas like both story lines were too uninteresting on their own, and Fordcouldn't let the rest of us figure out in our own how the two wererelated. This isn't a bad movie, I just think it was marketed assomething it's not, and doesn't deserve all the hype it's received. Ithink a lot of people just follow mob mentality, and will claimsomething a masterpiece just because that's how it was presented.
