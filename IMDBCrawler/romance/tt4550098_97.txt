There are two stories here, one about a woman who turned down love forriches and regrets it later, and another about a family who encounterstragedy at the hands of a group of criminals on the road. the storyabout the family seems like it was almost well done but was too shortto make a film so they threw in some garbage about the guy writing itand his ex-wife. I think this is some revenge flick that a writer usedto smear his ex in literary fiction because he had personal issues. Theending falls flat on it's face as it trails off which is a middlefinger to anyone that was interested in the ex-wife's story.TL;DR: Rent it, Watch only the family story line and fast-forwardthrough the ex-wife and writer story line. Maybe you'll enjoy it thenas a short film about what not to do on the back roads at night.
