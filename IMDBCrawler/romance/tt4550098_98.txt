Why?! Just a bad dark film, often times almost funny when it is tryingto be serious. Also a story within a story and both are just a sadcommentary on today's society. The acting was also subpar and there wasno connection to any character. What man would just let his wife anddaughter be taken without an all out fight? Just pathetic, all the wayaround, and great ending, at least we know none of these horriblecharacters have a future.
