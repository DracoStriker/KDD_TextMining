I went see this today as I'd read the book (even though I was alreadyspectacle from seeing the trailer...) I don't really know what to sayabout this movie to be honest... It was just so wrong. The character'sdidn't fit and it was super tacky but it's watchable.Maybe my review isn't the most accurate though as I was sat in thecinema with a bunch of loud teenagers who kept shrieking and runningaround D:
