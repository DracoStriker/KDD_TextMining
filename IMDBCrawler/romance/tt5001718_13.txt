The way this movie was done makes it SO boring! For a book where mostof it takes place in one location, there really has to be somethingthat makes the story interesting. In the movie, because of the pooracting, there is nothing that distracts from the fact that pretty muchthe whole thing takes place in the main character's house.And let's be honest: Maddy should have been shown a bit before seeingOlly. How else do viewers get to see how miserable her life is/ howhard it is always being inside? I feel like that definitely should havebeen shown more. Instead, we get weird 'artsy' scenes with astronautsthat are somehow supposed to make the scenes where they are textingmore interesting.So many scenes seemed stretched out and too long. It was sappy andextremely cheesy. I wanted to go see this, since I had read the book,but was honestly almost falling asleep trying to watch until the end.
