'Everything, Everything' gives off every vibe of just another 'Fault inOur Stars' but impressively enough, it somehow does something just alittle differently. Whether it was the clear chemistry and/or thefantastic acting ability given off by Amanda Stenberg, it ultimatelyresults in a product that is pure and genuine that shows a young loveas innocent and honest as it could be. Besides minor petty things,there is not much to complain about. Being a typical young adult drama,I can not give a stronger rating but all things considered, this is aglowing thumbs up for 'Everything, Everything'.
