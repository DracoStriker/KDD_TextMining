After finishing the book in two days I couldn't wait to see the movie!Finally going to the cinema and realizing it was the worst movie ever!The whole purpose of a romantic movie is to make the you feelsomething, I didn't feel anything except boredom! There was absolutelyno dept, no building towards the end. It would have been a better movieif they started with the crash of Maddy's parents and brother. I hadsuch high hopes but unfortunately it wasn't good at all.
