On the plus side, two very engaging leads and a love story that doesn'tsee skin colour as an issue.SPOILER ALERTS However, the story, while very moving, was very muchcontrived as a means to fulfilling the wishes of its protagonists andleft so many open ended questions. The really BIG one is - what if Maddie's SCID was real and notsomething cooked up in her mother's subconscious to protect her fromharm? In that light, Olly's willingness to jaunt off with her to Hawaii lookshighly irresponsible. It also does nothing to raise awareness andsympathy for people who really do have SCID, but makes theirnecessarily protected lives look like a cop out and refusal to pursuetheir dreams, because in Hollywood of course it'll work out great inthe end. As it happens, the leads both seem to be nice well-adjusted (andsurprisingly naive) people, despite Maddie having spent virtually herentire childhood on the computer and in books, with only her mother,nurse and the latter's daughter for human contact, while Olly's fatheris an alcoholic bully who treats his family badly and can't hold down ajob. And the open question at the end is of course, where do they go fromhere? Look out for a sequel...
