Everything,everything is my new favorite film, it shows a lot ofromance between the two main character (Maddy and Olly) both greatactors and made me feel like there was chemistry there between the twocharacters.it raises awareness for illnesses and love. the ending was abit rushed, but that is my only negative about the film. great storyline great characters , great music , well put together! in 24 hours ihave already watched this 5 times because i love it so much! i woulddefiantly like a sequel to this to show how the characters develop asMaddy finds out the truth about her and how all characters get along inrelationships etc. overall i love this film and it will probably be afavorite fir a long long time!
