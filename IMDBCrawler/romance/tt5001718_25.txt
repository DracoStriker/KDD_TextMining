Everything, Everything tells the unlikely love story between Maddy(Amandla Stenberg) and Olly (Nick Robinson). The reason this isunlikely is that Maddy cannot have any physical contact with people dueto her suffering from a rare immune disease. The movie is therefore allsetup to be a roller coaster ride for the emotions. The only trouble isthat this never really happens. You never really get deeply attached toany of the characters and the story just plays out without you everreally getting deeply involved. It isn't the worst movie ever, but youcan't help feeling that it should be a lot more engrossing.
