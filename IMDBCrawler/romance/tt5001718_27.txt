A teenager who's spent her whole life confined to her home falls forthe boy next door. If you liked films such as Me Before you, The Faultin our Stars and If i Stay this film is definitely made for you if notyou will be disappointed. Everything, Everything benefits from the 2main performances of Amandla Stenberg and Nick Robinson who have anamazing chemistry together and their characters are well written andvery interesting. The movie also has a nice twist in the end that ididn't even think about and to be even more honest the soundtrack andeven better the plot on it's own although not that original it's quitetouching knowing that such a young girl has been threw so much pain andhas suffered so much. The film doesn't reach the dramatic points of themovies that i mentioned on the beginning of this review but it's not asbad as critics made it sound like and if you like good teen romanticfilms i don't think that you will be disappointed. (8/10)
