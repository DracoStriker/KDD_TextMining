As someone who has to use pills which suppress the immune system, I cansay Everything, Everything reflects such a person's life and thoughtsvery well.The reality of a harsh disease meets super-styled environments andgood-natured characters in the movie. It's a Romeo & Juliet storynicely executed, catching the Zeitgeist. It captures the mind of Maddy-an isolated patient- well, emphasizing how you would depend on yourthoughts, imagination, and internet connection when you're all alone.It also captures the worry and love of characters around Maddy. Thedirector did a very good job and the acting is great at times, okay atothers. Ana de la Reguera shines as the nurse!As a negative point, we don't see any truly ugly side of the maincharacters. Instead, Maddy is almost disturbingly perfect. Her home isalso picture-perfect to the point it feels like a commercial set. Thecolor spectrum and animations are very polished and sugar-sweet,speaking to a young audience. The movie does one great thing to breakthe polished looks, though: It zooms on little details on skin which wenormally don't see in movies. It shows dots on skin, bumps on skin, asingle hair on skin, aka shows skin as skin at times. Anotherrefreshing point is, Maddy comes in a body shape that we're not used toseeing in movies. The camera doesn't try to hide the fat on her, norglorifies it for being simply fat: She's not a skinny Hollywood girland not the tattooed plus-size model in red lipstick: She's depicted asa teenage girl in her own body shape, and that body shape is glorifiedto the max. Olly, the main guy, comes in a look you can see in your ownneighborhood, and that allows you to focus on his personality, notthinking on how much he had to work on his abs.Some people found the main characters too lucky to have met, othersdidn't find the end of the movie believable. I disagree. Life is crazyboth in good and bad ways, and human psychology is like that, too. Justwatch the news, you would see!
