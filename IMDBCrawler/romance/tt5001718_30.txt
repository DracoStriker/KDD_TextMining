I titled it this as i don't want to get banned for not revealing its aspoiler even though it's obvious she's going to get out. Let me startby saying i've never, as far as I can tell, even heard of a filmdealing with this issue. I saw the trailer and didn't even watch theend before i wanted to watch it.It was so well done too. The boy fromnext door, the way the film shows how they interacted with each other,which is so well done,I loved it. I could go on but the whole reason ,i wrote this review is because of the end. I won't spoil the end. A bigproblem for me watching films is I always know the end and it makes itless good when the inevitable happens.I can honestly say this is a filmending I never saw coming in a million years. I won't give away theend. What i will say, as the title suggests, it's obvious she was goingto get out of the house. What infuriated me was of all thepossibilities they could have chose, they went with the worst. Itreally angered me and ruined the film for me. I was genuinely going tobuy it till I saw the end.
