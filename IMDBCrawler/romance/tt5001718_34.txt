At the back end of a trans-continental flight I scanned those movieswhich I could see to their conclusion in the time left, and pickedthis.Early on I thought "OK, sad story, but where is it going?"And then it referenced 'Rigoletto' with nurse Carla allowing Maddy tosecretly see Olly. And in no time after that the incongruities began tocreep in. When the mother fires Carla and appoints a tyrannicalreplacement with a face like a half-sucked lemon, you think "Hey, thisis an 18-year-old. She's an adult, and her mother is imprisoning her"and the inevitable conclusion begins to play out.I certainly know a lot from personal experience about domineeringmothers suffocating their children's ambitions for a good andindependent life, sometimes with tragic consequences. So that side ofit was brought out. But on the whole it was lightweight, and merits nomore than 6/10. But it did just fit into the flight!
