I never watch teen dramas so I watched this with a blank slate, and noidea of any movie to compare it to. I was surprised at how relevant itis to millenials. Besides romance, it is a coming of age tale in whicha teenage reaches a stage where she fully grows and breaks free fromher bonds. In the Asian context, the movie can be relatedmetaphorically, given how Asian parents are rather controlling andpossessive. Amandla Stenberg gave a very honest performance as theprotagonist, and Anika Noni Rose was brilliant as Stenberg's mother.The storytelling was interesting because the director used differenttechniques to convey the story, which makes this romance unique. Theuse of first person narrative, subtitles to convey hidden thoughts, anda plot twist really made this movie stand out from the rest. Irecommend it for any teen or young adults who enjoy romance.
