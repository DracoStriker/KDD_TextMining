Maddy Whittier has Severe Combined Immunodeficiency and has spent mostof her life in isolation at home. The only visitors are her doctormother, her maid, and the maid's daughter. A new family moves in nextdoor and she's taken with the son, Olly Bright. She spends her daysreading books and blogging micro-short spoiler reviews.It's not quite boy-in-the-bubble. This is bubble boy adjacent. Myinitial thoughts were that it's strange to allow people have directcontact with her. Something is wrong telegraphing the eventual reveal.I really like the astronaut as a visual cue for the imaginary world.The movie would work better for the kids to stay in that imaginaryworld. They could have great conversations about books and his schoollife. They are super cute together and have an adorable time. It'sunlikely that they go off to Hawaii and it would be more poignant towalk off to the beach. The reveal is fine and obvious. It's more aboutthe puppy love.
