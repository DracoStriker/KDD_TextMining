I thought this movie was great! You definitely want to be on the mom'sside for the health for her daughter, but then by the end of the movieyou are angry with her for not letting her daughter enjoy all thethings in life that is outside of the house. I thought this movie waswell written and hard to believe the girl in this video is the same onewho plays Roo in The Hunger Games!
