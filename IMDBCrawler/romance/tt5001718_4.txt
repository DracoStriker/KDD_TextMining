I recently went and saw Everything, Everything with a few of myfriends. They had not read the book before hand, but I had. I was readyto point out all the differences between the two. Come on, it's a YAadaption, when doesn't it have a few major changes? However, I couldn'tfind anything. Sure there were a few minor changes, but nothing superimportant; Nick Robinson, Amandla Stenberg, and the rest of the castwere phenomenal. Me and all my friends loved it.
