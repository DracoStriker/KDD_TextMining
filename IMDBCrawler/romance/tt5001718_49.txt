I went to the cinema to see "Everything Everything," after reading thebook. I thought that it was a great film full of romance and action. Iwould recommend this film to ages: 14-17, as it is a film for teenagersor young adults. Maddy is played by such an amazing actress and I willdefinitely consider purchasing this film and watching it again. Attimes it feels a little slow paced and cheesy, but if you are lookingfor some light-hearted romance, then this film is for you! It is mykind of film and I thought it was excellent, but you should read thebook before you see it! Enjoy! I give it 10/10, and it was better thanI expected. Please go into it with an open mind, because my brother wasmoaning on the way in, but laughing on the way out. Even if you don'tthink you will like it, please just watch it!
