So i read the book Everything, Everything back around when the filmcame out, I was enjoying it until a certain plot twist that just ruinedthe story, but I still wanted to check this out, and it did deliver abit. The performances were all solid, and the soundtrack was fun tolisten to, however they added in some sequences were when the two maincharacters were texting, the female would imagine they were actuallytalking in person, which just came off as jarring, while its not thebest book to film Adaptation I've seen, it was still a decently madefilm
