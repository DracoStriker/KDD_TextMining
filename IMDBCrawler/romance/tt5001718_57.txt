It is the best movie I watched in a while.. it is like i was the girlfrom the movie.. you can just fill how she feels. I just can notbelieve this movie is so brilliant. Sometimes life is like some peoplearound us want us to be, but when we find something to be happy aboutwe have to do everything in our power to become the person we alwaysdreamed of. Life is too short for being inside and not seeing theworld. If you find your happiness you ave to work to get to it. I am a18 years old student who loves to travel and i have the smile on myface like she had when she saw the sea. I want all of you to watch andfeel the movie like I did.You HAVE to watch it. :) enjoy.Nastja from Slovenia.
