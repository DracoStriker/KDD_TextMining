On the good side, the acting was good by the two leads. They are thebest thing about this by-the-numbers, formulaic and cliché riddenmovie.Even the twist near the end of the movie was very easy to see coming.Hollywood seems to have a very hard time coming up with anythingoriginal lately. They must be hiring very young but educated peoplewith little life experience. This shows in the movie's characterdevelopment. For example, the two lead characters seem extremely welladjusted and polite considering their home environment. She lives inextreme isolation and he has an abusive drunk for a father yet thesecircumstances don't rub off their characters.
