Yesterday I went to the cinema and watched this movie. The only goodthing about it was delicious popcorn. What a waste of time and money.First of all, dialogues are so cheezy and predictable. I would compareit with a love poem written by the primary school kid. Besides, actingwas completely unconvincing. The audience was actually laughing at someparts that did not suppose to be funny, but they were because of badacting. There were few particularly awkward scenes. And plot twist inthe end... completely unnecessary.I don't know, maybe I'm to old for this kind of movie, but in myopinion adults won't see much quality in this movie.
