It's no coincidence that the recent years of the world cinema, manydirectors are somewhat inclined toward the production of emotional filmgenre (love/romantic) stimulates the psychology of teenager -- becausethey don't have much experience in life marriage or family.The first time I saw this poster I thought of Alessia Cara play therole of main character -- the girl (Maddy) look like exactly. Doesanyone else think like me (?!). That's a joke -- no need to payattention. Let's-get-back to the point by now!At the beginning of the story we can see Maddy's appearance - a personwho has a disease (don't want to say is terminally ill) that thinginterferes with her social interaction.The girl is coming to the most important stage of her life but she isunfortunately unlucky when she has a terrible disease. Of course, wecan see people are so "small" in life when they are completelyhelpless, can't prevent bad things its from happening to themselves orsave themselves -- it seems like a game (win/lose).Perhaps fate has put two strangers together so closer when Olly, aneighbor boy meets Maddy -- two lives, two different fate but with thesame aspirations of life: for a love surpasses all..I think the director may have been successful in building this detail-- making viewers feel moved and shocked when they realized: "In theface of the temptation, the difficulty of life can they find their reallover?!".The story doesn't seem to end there, and again, the film starts (onscreen) Maddy sees that Olly's father attacked him at the same timethat Pauline realized that Maddy was near Olly, and fired on Carla."A beautiful love but is prevented by the cruelty of human?" -- Wecan't possibly not see that thing through the film!Notable when Maddy, she decides to risk her health to realize herdreams of interaction and experience in the outside world, and runsaway to Hawaii with Olly, and they "interact" with each other.Unfortunately, for Maddy, she was becomes ill and is paralyzed.Obviously, we can't deny that thing! Because its provide the fact: itshas brought to the truth that everyone is shocked when the desire forhuman life is so intense, in the face of difficulties and they don'tsurrender!Not long after, the illness once again had a profound effect on Maddy,and she realized how long she could not live (!). Maybe, the audience will ask yourself -- and of course it will alwayshave the answer through the film!A teen girl with an aspiration desire to conquer life (as Maddy)because of a disease that can make she become hopeless until sherealizes another shocking truth (not convenient when it comes to,watch-the-movie and you know how it feels!).After that event, Maddy with obsessive memories decides to move to NewYork and become husband and wife (Happy Ending) -- This is the valuabletime for you relax some emotions!The viewer may surprise with the details in the middle of the movie,but they may be "feel so down" at the end of the movie (because thestory lines its a bit fast) if any one of someone not concentrate onwatching the movie. As a result, they will feel its boring and slightly"unattractive".This movie is not rated high **Look IMDb ratings before you readingthis lines!**My opinion: I really like the film because it contains a lot ofelements of the human emotions (teenagers should see) -- they will beable to experience a lot of life experiences through this film, theprecious things they are looking from a long time...
