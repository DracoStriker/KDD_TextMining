I just came back from a screening for this film so I wanted this reviewto be as fresh as possible for you guys. As someone who actuallyappreciated teen-romance films based on previous novels such as TheFault in Our Stars, The Spectacular Now, hell, even Paper Towns, thisfilm was a stressful one to sit through.Our main actress, Amandla Stenberg who you may know as Rue from TheHunger Games, is so blank as an actor that I believe a mannequin couldhave upstaged her with this performance. Her love interest played byNick Robinson is hit or miss in this film as you may have seen him asthe older brother in Jurassic World. Think of that what you will. Thesetwo as a couple do not have the spark or chemistry that makes usbelieve they work together cohesively. The first act of the movie isthem awkwardly staring at each other for time periods too long for theaverage moviegoer's sake.This movie is full of the most superfluous decisions that I wasseething within the first half hour. Eventually, I had to calm myselfdown knowing that this film was not going to get any better. Therefore,I had a blast with the lazy music choices, predictable writing thatdoes not amount to its book, and the unnecessary plot twist that doesnot make any sense nor does it give an effort to explain it whatsoever.The rest of the supporting cast are also mediocre actors giving theirbest to deliver such awful bits and pieces of dialogue from someone whofelt compelled to make a film based on a teen novel that will yet againbring insecure prepubescents to the theater. Please avoid at all costs.
