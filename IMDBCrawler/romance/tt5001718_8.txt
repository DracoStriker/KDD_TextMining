I went to the theater not expecting much, having previously read thebook, I doubted the movie would be as good. I was wrong. Everythingeverything is a beautiful movie for everyone. Seriously, just go watchthe movie.If you need more convincing, let me break it down for you. It's adiverse movie without the main topic being race. Amandla Stenberg andNick Robinson both to beautiful acting jobs, bringing their characters,Maddy and Olly, to life. Both characters are interesting, deep, andmost importantly, alive.I'll probably use the word beautiful to describe this movie way toomuch, but that's because it really is a beautiful movie. The visualsare gorgeous, every shot is artistic. It's also a very aesthetic movieto watch. I also really enjoyed the music played throughout the filmand during the credits. It was a beautiful story with depth.In conclusion, just go watch the movie.
