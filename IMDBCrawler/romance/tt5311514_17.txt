This film will leave you speechless - it is quite simply one of themost beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. The animation isbreathtaking and possibly the most beautiful animation ever put toscreen. There really are no words to capture exactly how it makes youfeel because this is simply a film that will move you in inexplicableways. Sit down, enter the world that Makoto Shinkai has presented to usand soak in all of the magic. Un-be-lievable experience!
