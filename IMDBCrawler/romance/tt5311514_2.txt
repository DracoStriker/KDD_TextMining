Absolutely fantastic! Recommended for everyone.Just watch it.Amazing characters, scenery, city life and town life, story. Everythingis just wow. So fine! The suspension, the empathy, the scenes. Thethoughts. It's playful and pleasant, but serious and funny at the sametime. It makes you want to feel it and live it, while you just keepcheering for everything.This 1.5 hours was one of the most well spent time in my life. It wasso good, that I actually sit down and wondered why we can't we livelike that? Why can't we be in that village? In that anime Tokyo?Every minute is a time well-spent. It's a time SO well spent, that Iwas afraid when it's going to end. I literally just realized that thiswould be the end of an anime. Than this would be the end of an hourlong movie.I was so afraid when it's going to end. It borough such a beautiful andmarvelous utopia before my eyes, with all it's mistakes, conflicts.That I actually wanted to live there. I actually realized however, thatI'm not good of a person to be worthy of such utopia.However it is very close to reality. Every time something out of orderhappens, you remember. This is a certain reality. People can die, beashamed, punished. Everything can end in a tragedy. But when somethingwrong happens, nobody really cares.. and I was like: "Why? Why aren'tyou moving? Are you not afraid for your lives?" Than I remembered..this is a certain utopia. Even for the people who live in it. Nothingbad happen to them, nothing really could. They are peaceful, goodpeople, in a modern world. Nothing bad happened in the last 3generation, why would anything happen now?This movie gave me a new set of feelings, viewpoints, happiness,thoughts and desires, I might have lacked or just not realized before.I'm really glad I watched it. It was a piece from my dreams.
