So I just had the pleasure of enjoying "Your Name" in the cinema andthough I could share some thoughts.(May contain very minor spoilers)I've seen many movies trying to pull off the "two people mysteriouslychange body with one another", but I've never seen a movie doing a goodjob with it. Until now, that is. Makoto Shinkai's "Your Name (Kimi nona wa)" has finally succeeded at the task. With a very well deservedrating of 8.6 and 113th placing on the list of 250 top rated movies ofall time, "Your Name" delivers us anything we could ask from it:A terrific artwork, the movie's animation is extremely well made, withbeautiful landscape scenes accompanied with an excellent soundtrack;the sky, sun, water and comets are completely astonishing andmesmerizing to watch. There is even a psychedelic like animation scenehalfway through the movie during a critical moment that is deeplytouching. Just like in every of Mokoto's movies, the characters areextremely well constructed and it makes you fall in love with themafter 10 minutes into the movie, developing a huge emotional bound tothe story. The movie had a perfect balance of everything: comedy (whichisn't always present on Makoto Shinkai movies, so it was quite pleasantto see it in this one) drama, romance, some mystery, all with a touchof non-linear movie structure. It's the type of movie that will makeyou laugh, cry, laugh while crying? The movie's perspective constantlychanges between the two main characters, what gave it a very touch andit's not something you see very often.For every anime fan this movie is definitely a must watch, and even fornon anime fans I'do recommend to give it a try!
