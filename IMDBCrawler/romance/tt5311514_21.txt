Had Already watched the Japanese version and now watched the Englishdub version (which had average voice acting/. Still can't get over howamazing this movie is. I was under a lot of depression when I went towatch it , knowing very little about what was at offer. And boy was Ientertained! Since then, I've bought the soundtrack album in Japanese,read the novel on which the movie is made and amongst all this , mydepression has cured. It's unbelievable! There's nothing wrong with themovie at all! The rating ? 11/10 for me! :P PS those who still don'ttrust all the positive user reviews should just realize that themetascore is 78! It's not easy at all to get that high number. Thebottom line being that it's a roller coaster ride of emotions that isbound to make a long lasting impact upon you. Highly recommend watchingit in Japanese as that's how the director wants us to see it.
