An inspirational movie!The movie is a journey searching for happiness -- enthusiasm, full ofvitality of youth impacted by hard life.When people are young, they give themselves the right to dreamlesswhereas they hypnotize themselves with vague, unrealistic and illusionthing.Tiamat comet is the source of the disaster which affect to this story.Mitsuha, she decides to go beyond the shell seeking for somethingbetter when she know about her boring life, repeat -- nothingoutstanding; And so the story begins when two people enter each other's bodies -- aunique, novel script... On the words, that thing has made a deepimpression for me.The film is a timeless fantasy story (took place after that) reallytouched me: Taki try to everything to save Mitsuha out of killed byTiamat disasters and when Taki hold a end of red rope and he found thatthe time line frame between he and Mihata does not match -- a twopeople love each other very much but separated-by-a-space.I cried...A happy man, a lover named Taki!In my opinion, Taki or any Japanese (even me) is obsessed with thepower of nature but he have a strong-spirits try to get over; notsurrender, not give up on life! Movie of heaven! 110 minutes of "Your Name" it was a precious time forme to look at myself and experience the many different emotions thatany other movie has never make me feel like this! This movie is not good because it TOO EXCELLENT!!Allow me to say: "This is one of the best movie I've ever seen in myentire life -- From now, the future and forever!".11/10 -- my maximum ratings and this film deserves more than that!
