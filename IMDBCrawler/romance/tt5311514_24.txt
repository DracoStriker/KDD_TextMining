--------- NO SPOILERS -----------------------I saw the movie three days ago and it's still stuck in my mind. Animemovies are mostly under-appreciated and if you are thinking aboutgetting into it this is the movie. This movie is beautiful. The story,the animation, the speech, the suspense and mostly the characters. Youstart feeling for characters whether they're side or main characters.This one scene in the movie the person sitting next to me was justwhispering "no, no, no. Please no" and i was actually thinking the samething. In my 18 years of life i had never seen someone that much intothe movie. I looked around in the cinema and some people were sheddingtears. It was beautiful. I'm doing a spoiler-less review because if you're wondering to yourselfwhether this movie is really worth going to, it really is. The story issomething that a lot of romantic movies in general can learn from.Despite being romance, this doesn't mean there to be cheesy dialoguesetc. This movie despite being romance does it so well that you don'teven think about it. The movie being about two teenagers literallybeing miles apart from each other but still you understand theirstruggles and everything. It's a masterpiece and i'll be sure topre-order it as soon as i can.
