I have read quite a few reviews from both side before writing mine; Icould understand why some people dislike this movie.For those who love this movie, they are those viewers who flow with thestory with an open mind. There are always flaws in every story, if wekeep nitpicking the plot hole, they will never come to appreciate whata movie could offer to them.People seems to forget the reason to watch a movie - to escape from ourreality. This movie does deliver a moment for the audience to get alongthis amazing journey of Mitsuha and Taki. My wife and I try to solvethe puzzle when the story continue to unfold, there were a few momentthat we were able to put pieces together and see if the story goes aswe thought. There were also moment we doubted whether the event will bedifferent than it originally was. We hold our breath to see how thestory will end, I was crossing my finger that the ending will be atleast in some form of closure. I am glad that it was.Referring back to my review's title, by walking through this story, Icould feel, once again, the energy by being youth. I am in my mid 40sand this movie touch my soul and brought my heart out as in my 20s.For those who can't stand any flaw in the story line, I believe thismovie will not able to touch your heart or I should say, this is notyour cup of tea.
