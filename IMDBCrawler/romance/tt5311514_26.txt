I might have found it.I can only describe You Name as masterpiece a term that have only usedfor a small handful of films that I have watched throughout my life.I've seen Shinkai's previous films which I really enjoyed but this ishis greatest work so far. Forget the comparisons to Miyazaki becausealthough Your Name is beautifully animated, has a wonderful score andweaves a engrossing tale it has little in common with Miyazaki's workother than the media - that's not to say it's any lesser piece of work.If you have seen the trailer you'll probably think that this won't willbe much different to other body swap films or anime that you might haveseen, however Your Name is much more than that and deftly mixes variousgenres to make a very satisfying whole and everything about this filmis pitch perfect.The first act sets up the body swap scenario and this section is sweet,funny and charming. It really helps the audience to get to know andcare about the characters while it also mostly sidesteps many of theclichés as the body swap is less about gender and more about city vscountryside, modern vs tradition, dreams vs reality and of coursedistance.However as the first act comes to a close - just when you think youknow where the film is going Miyazaki pulls the rug from under yourfeet with a twist that you won't see coming (despite some hints).Unlike most films where the 'big twist' seems tacked on or used in anattempt to make something seem clever, the twist in Your Name feelscompletely organic and deserved.It's here where the tone changes and that kind of shift is really hardto pull off however Miyazaki handles it brilliantly, as the tone shiftnever jars against the first act it actually compliments it!. The restof Your Name has an utterly beautiful sense of melancholy and longingwhich most films would find hard to equal.I don't want to reveal any more about the film as you really need toexperience for yourself. Needless to say that the films visuals aregorgeous but special mentions for the editing which I thought wasamazing and the score and songs by Radwimps which really helped thefilm find it's heart.I don't often cry at films especially if it feels they are attemptingto force an emotion from me. Beauty or genus tend to make me cry andfor the last 15-20 minutes of Your Name tears streamed down my face.Highly recommended, a must see! You don't have to be an Anime fan toenjoy this!
