Having seen other movies (Garden of Words, 5 centimeters per second andChildren Who Chase Lost Voices) from Makoto Shinkai, I've been preparedfor the visual masterpiece that is Your Name, but the well built,interesting story was a pleasant surprise.While his other movies were a bit slow or uninteresting for me, thisone managed to get pacing and plot right, and was successful in keepingmy interest, and managed to build a smart story from the cornybody-switch basics.I'm hesitating between 8 and 9 stars, as I've felt the story could havebeen a bit more complex, and there were some plot holes, that are notso easy to overlook. I'm giving it an 8, but a strong 8...Stop reading, and just go see it already, it's worth it (japanese dub +subtitles).
