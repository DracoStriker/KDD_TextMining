"Your Name" it's the strongest definition of "style over substance" theanimation it's fantastic, the soundtrack it's really enjoyable and thebackgrounds arts it's beautiful. But the plot of the movie it's alittle bit soft, it's like see your (a)typical romantic movie. It'sglad to watch but like a said it's "style over substance".
