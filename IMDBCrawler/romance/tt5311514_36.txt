I don't normally review a movie, in fact this will be my first time.The reason that I needed to make one because I was astonished withsomething that I just watched, and I feel that people need to watch ittoo.Great story line with twists here and there, great characters anddevelopment, supported by excellent animation and music.I came to the cinema with the expectation of this movie would be asgood as 5 cm per second, in fact it surpassed my expectation. I couldnot even remember when was the last time I watch a movie withoutchecking my watch, which means that every single minutes, frombeginning till the end, the scenes were very enjoyable and well fit into the whole flow of the story.This movie also reminded that how great Japanese movies in Asia werebefore Korean movies started coming to scene. Honestly speakingJapanese animate will still be my number one pick when it comes toanimation.In conclusion, this is a must watch for everybody, whether you likeanime or not. Highly recommended!
