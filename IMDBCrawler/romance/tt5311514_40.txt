A good anime that has a message, interesting characters, authenticitydespite retelling a niche sub-genre story. The work that has gone intoand the originality are appreciated. What was less impressive was thestoic reactions and matter-of-fact behaviours. With that said this isquite an accomplishment and I know that with the announced Hollywoodremake we the fans need to boycott the coming movie. Hollywood has tolearn that their predatory attack on anything popular for theirinfamous remake series will not be tolerated. Look how they mockedGhost In The Shell (rolling my eyes as I write).
