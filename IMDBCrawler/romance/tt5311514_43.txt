The movie shows the story of two teenagers that are complete strangersbut they have a very weird connection. There are days that they wake upand suddenly they realize that they've swapped bodies. The movie showshow they learn to live with this strange connection but there'ssomething more to it, something that I won't spoil.I can't decide if the movie is fantasy, romantic, comedy or dramabecause it has a little bit of every one of those. The movie looksbeautiful and is very unique, I haven't seen a movie like it in myentire life. The movie is very funny, I was at the theater (almostfull) and everyone was laughing a lot at the parts where the moviewanted us to laugh. And it doesn't have a problem to find a balancebetween comedy and seriousness throughout all of its run time.The two main characters, Mitsuha and Taki, are just two normalteenagers that go to school and hang out with their friends but youcare about them and because of this you feel invested in the story. Youcan feel a lot of emotions throughout the movie and for me, when amovie does that, is the best thing in the world. Honestly, I couldn'tfind a single flaw with the movie.This is a movie you can't miss. Even if you are not a fan of anime youcan enjoy this movie. I enjoy anime but I almost don't watch it but Ireally loved this movie.
