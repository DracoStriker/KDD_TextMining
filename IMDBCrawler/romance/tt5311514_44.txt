A mega-hit anime not produced by the named Studio Ghibli, theup-and-coming animator Makoto Shinkai's fifth feature-length film, YOURNAME is Japanese box office champion in 2016, grossed ¥23 billion(circa US$190 million), the fourth largest in the history ever. It starts as a gender-swapping yarn in the present day, Mitsuha, amotherless high school girl from a mountainous region, who lives withher grandma and a younger sister in their family shrine whereas herestranged father is running for the mayor of the town, grouses abouther stagnant rural life and dreams of being a boy living in the bigcity, when a mysterious comet strikes across the firmament, it seemsher wish is granted, she wakes up in the body of Taki, a high schoolboy in Tokyo, and vice versa, the swapping alternates on a daily basisand rebounds to both despite the initial confusion and the side effectof fading memories, Mitsuha becomes popular in the school with Takitakes over her body whilst Miki, the co-worker whom Taki has a crushon, starts to feel closer to him thanks to Mitsuha's feminineintervention. Laden with generic but scintillating humor (Mitsuha'shabitual gazing and fondling of her boobs when her body is inhabited byTaki, but ostensibly not the other way around), zippy editing rhythmand hooky J-Pop anthems, the chucklesome paragraph reaches a halt whenone day, Taki finds out that the swapping stops, and what follows arehis dogged endeavor to looking for Mitsuha's village whose name eludeshim with a bolt from the blue waiting down the line. Apparently and inexplicably, their temporalities are not uniform, butseparated by three years, and Shinkai's savvy script circumspectlyintroduces the time-warp into the plot, which evolves into a touchingand urgent past-changing undertaking for Mitsuha, facilitated by thenuminous power of the traditional mouth-chewed sake and interlaced witha transcendent vis-à-vis in the twilight hour during which the twonearly have time to write down their names. The cataclysm cannot beaverted but at least many lives are saved, yet, hampered by the fadingmemories of each other's names, will they be reunited in the sameuniverse? You bet! Although the ending has a strained elation blatantlyturning a blind on the odds of two individuals actually pass by eachother randomly in a metropolis like Tokyo. Shinkai's virtuosity of devising picturesque scenery is anextraordinary feat to be reckoned with, a spate of celestial splendorand awe-inspiring landscape are scenery porn to hungry eyes, sometimesspiffed up by flashy juxtapositions of memories and hand-writtensketches. Nevertheless, being someone who hasn't been versed in therealm of anime, one might wantonly hazard that the human character is aweak link in the process, their looks are invariably pedestrian and shyof memorable distinctions, perhaps it is an intrinsic defect in theanimation where the niceties of facial expressions are still quite achallenge to visualize in technique terms. However, nothing can denythat YOUR NAME is a massive success and an infallible testimony ofShinkai's faculty to carry on the anime torch from royalties like HayaoMiyazaki and Isao Takahata.
