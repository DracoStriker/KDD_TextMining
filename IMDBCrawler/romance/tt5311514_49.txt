I happened upon this film just last night. I was planning on seeing adifferent movie, but changed mind when I saw the poster at the movietheater as I am a Japanese anime fan in general. And "WOW" is all I cansay about this film. Born and grew up in Asia I have no problem withunderstanding the cultural symbols flashing through much of the film.It would be a cliché of me to describe how beautiful the production isand how vivid the pictures are. What captures me most is the poignantemotional connections between the film characters as well as withaudience like me. The film's story line evolves from a devastatingcatastrophe caused by meteor shower, but out of it emerges compassion,courage and strength. It is more than a sci-fi movie, it is a movie ofhumanity. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to get a copy of the BRdisc as soon as it comes out.
