My heart stopped at least 20 times watching this movie. It was soemotional, so interesting, so odd, so beautiful I don't even know if Ican find enough words to express how good it really was. The story wasabsolutely fantastic and the soundtrack fits it perfectly. I'm not thekind that cries during movies but this one had me in tears for like 20minutes. It's a must!
