Oh, and gorgeously animated.I think that's a fair way to sum up this movie. It starts out as afantasy and, as it reveals more puzzle pieces, you realize it's morescience fiction. There are tightly plotted reasons for everythingthat's going on, all of which are revealed in good time.Like like all good puzzle movies, there's a thrill every time somethingis revealed that ties things together. It's complex enough that youwant to see it again immediately, but no so complex that you have anydoubt as to what basically happened.Like Donnie Darko, while it's busy scrambling your head and keeping youguessing, it is somehow managing to be deep, both emotionally andthematically (the latter drawing on Japanese culture and religion).Unlike Donnie Darko, it's never dark and disturbing in a creepy way,although there is plenty of danger and peril. Instead, it radiatessweetness and love, without ever becoming saccharine.Donnie Darko is one of my two or three favorite films of all time, sothis is high praise. Of all the films I've seen since, nothing has comecloser to matching its combination of thrilling revelations, emotionalresonance, and thematic depth than Your Name.
