A late contender but strong contender for one of the best films I'veseen in 2016 and maybe even thus far. (I've never starred a film beforebut by God this one deserves it!) "Your Name" is a feature filmJapanese anime so it's for those who can tolerate foreign films andanimation. And by animation I mean painstakingly breath-takinganimation that goes from encapsulating almost photo-realisticallyvibrant sunsets to the slightest twitch in expression giving soul tothe characters before us.I'm not one to judge anime but I'll say this: of the little I'vewatched, never have I seen such detailed artwork, animation so real andvoice acting so fitting that the characters are so alive that yougenuinely wish that they were. The consistent top-notch animation,artwork, soundtrack, directing and even the voice acting was clearlydone with love and care to the point that the finished film looks andfeels like a passion project without a deadline striving forperfection.Oh and it's not just looks too it's got brains as well. I was hooked onthe plot from the beginning and although I can't comment on the amazingplot without ruining it, you should expect a drama/romance/fantasy. Iguess you're just going to have to take a leap of faith here... Even ifthe plot sounds a little 90s.It was a spectacle to watch unfold, it made me laugh, it made me cry,it had me fully invested from start to finish and most importantly, itmade me feel. I don't think one can ask for more in a film.
