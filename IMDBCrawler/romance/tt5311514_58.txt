When the movie started, I was a bit disoriented, as the first fewscenes had fast cuts, and I hadn't been grounded yet. There is a lot oftime travel and this does get confusing throughout the film, but Iwasn't very bothered by it. I'd say that the constant time shiftsactually add to the mystery of the story, as you're always trying tofigure out where in the timeline you've jumped to. The animation is great, with vivid colors and great lighting effects. Ican't imagine how difficult and time consuming it is to make graphicslook realistic. I just enjoy the finished product. Very detailed work.I think there is more of a 3D depth to anime than there is withcartoons. Just something about their technique gives it so much moreaesthetics. Or perhaps it is also the vast range of colors that areused. The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, and that's what makes itso magical. Anything can happen next, and you don't see it coming. Iwas thoroughly invested with the story and found the script to be bothcomedic and culturally aware. The two main characters are quitedifferent from each other, but both are headstrong and theirstubbornness is fun to watch. Overall, this is a great fantastical film to watch, for both the oldand the young.
