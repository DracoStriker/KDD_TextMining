This is a movie that does not look like much at first; nothing fancy orgroundbreaking, just the fantasy of a small town girl who wishes tochange her life. And then, it just happens: seemingly at random, sheshifts bodies with a teenage boy, and a relationship starts. As theyget to know each other, the feelings show and something settles, untilsuddenly, it all stops. No more exchanges, and the boy startsforgetting. All that remains is a nagging feeling that he is lookingfor somebody, but does not remember her name... This movie is beautifulin its simplicity, and the emotions it brings up. It does not try toexplain the why and the how, but rather to make the viewer feels. Andit succeeds. While it could be considered slow at times, each momentcontributes towards the evolution of the story and the ending. Verymuch worth a watch!
