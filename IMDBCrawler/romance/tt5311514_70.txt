I came to Your Name only knowing that it was a body-swap film, and thatit was supposed to be good. Beyond that I did not know much at all. Icannot remember if I was told it was a comedy, or merely assumed it wasa comedy on the basis that all bodyswap films seem to play that elementto the maximum. Regardless, I did not know much about it.The film opens very much in the genre that I expected, and we spend thefirst half of the film in this vein; two teenagers in different partsof Japan swap bodies every so often ? a boy and girl. After a while itbecomes a routine, and they leave each other notes on their telephonesto help the visitor play out the lives correctly. In this half the filmis lively, funny, sweet, and enjoyable for what it does with thecharacters in terms of establishing them but also swapping them around.The middle of the film sees a change to this direction, and instead theroot of the jumping, and more detail of the situation, is laid out. Atthis point there is much more mystery, urgency, and drama to the storyas it unfolds. It does this in a way that in no way discards what hasgone before, but uses our charmed investment to make the second halfwork even better. It does this all the way to an ending which seemslike nothing to describe it, but yet left me with tears in my eyes.The character creation and the spot-on judgment of tone are two keyelements in making it work, but of course not only. Animation is greatthroughout and the music, although a little corny perhaps, plays offthe emotions in the story well ? again a factor in me having somethingin my eye at the end. I'm not sure a second watch will have quite thesame impact on me as the first time did, but I will watch it again. Itis a great little film ? worthy of the praise it received on release inEurope, and worth watching even if you have zero interest in subtitledor animated films.
