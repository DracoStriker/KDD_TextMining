Everything in this movie is quite perfect-Timing, Plot, Backsound. Fromthe start, i thought this movie would be boring just like any otherAnime nowadays, but Makoto Shinkai give us something different. Bothmain characters he brought in this movie was so very catching. Thetitle just very perfect. And for the last, this movie bring me a newpoint of view. Thank you, Makoto Shinkai.
