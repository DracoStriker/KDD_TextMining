So much enticing, so much heart breaking yet so well crafted that thisbeauty never diminishes till the end. I had not such expectations thatthis animated feature would tend to be so alluring let alone carving ascar on my heart with such a graceful story line. By the time i washalf way through the movie, my world of imagination and consciousnesswas turned upside down being totally engrossed in this art. Having afondness towards anime series but an inclination to shun any kind ofanime movie, I couldn't be more satisfied and contented with thedecision of watching this sensational work of Makoto Shinkai, thewriter and director.The way both the characters develop is sobrilliantly constructed that it makes you ship for their unionirresistibly. The plot was suffice enough for an Oscar nomination but iwonder why it wasn't. If you add up the animations, the plot twist.voice dub, and yes especially the music! The music is everything thatmakes it so much beyond heart warming. It really suits with thescenario and with the characters as well making it the real beauty thatit is.If you are not familiar with animated movies or more precisely to sayJapanese anime. This one will certainly get you started. I woulddefinitely rank this as one of the best movies i have ever seen andundoubtedly place this as my best animated movie feature of all time.Definitely a piece to watch.
