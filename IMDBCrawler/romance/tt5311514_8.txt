This was absolutely amazing... the trailer made it seem like astereotypical "boy meets girl, etc." story... but from the beginning tothe end, the movie rotated from a past and present time-line, onlyproving in the end that time itself was twisted the entire movie -giving us viewers an extremely well written and original plot. Thechemistry between the characters, development, music, pacing,animation, everything was absolutely in chorus in the most beautifulway. I cannot even compare this to Studio Ghibli films, not becauseit's better or not as good, but because it is just a movie of its owncaliber. Studio Ghibli films were a lot more fictional, fantasy, andimaginative - free formed and had its own flow. Kimi no Na Wa wascleverly planned out from the first minute to the last, logical,balanced, yet just as if not more breathtaking.
