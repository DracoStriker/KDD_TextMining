The movie started with one simple idea: The feeling that you have whenyou met someone for the first time. Similar. Warm. Touching. Just likeyou have known each other for such a long time, and somehow, you wasseparated. And you know deep in your heart that you are still lookingfor that one every single day, you will know right away when you meteach other. With that simple idea Makoto Shinkai have developed andbuilt a master piece have in the name: Your name. Taki is a city boy.Mitsuha is a country girl. They have different life, not to mentiontotally opposite. But by a mystic power, they are connected to eachother, through space, time. A lot of thing happened for variousreasons, and they have forgot each other. But deep inside, they bothfeel a gap, a hole which cannot be filled. They neither understand norexplain, but they know that they are looking for each other. It mighttake months, years, lives but they know they will recognize each otherimmediately... I have to mention again: the movie is such amasterpiece. The story is touching and meaningful. It is magical yet itis familiar with everyone of us. The animation is beautiful. Storytelling is good and logical. The music in the movie is somethingspecial. It is not just matching and touching, it is also affected themovie itself. If you read the book, you will find out that even beforethey met, RADWIMPS and Makoto had the same thought about the originalidea. A lot of thing in the story had been changed according to thelyrics. If you have enjoyed other movie of Makoto like 5cm per seconds,you will enjoy this movie too. To me, this movie is nothing but one thebest two anime of all time, with Spirited Away.
