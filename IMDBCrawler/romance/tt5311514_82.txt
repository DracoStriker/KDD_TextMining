It's difficult to talk about this anime's content without any spoilersso to keep it short:Just watch it. If you are in the mood for a mysterious, philosophicalstory with some comedy and romance elements that evolves around a veryinteresting, intelligent and just astonishing story then trust all theother positive voices, read as little about the plot as you can andjust give it a go.The only non-spoilery disclaimer I want to give is that the first tenminutes are really "weird" and confusing but make perfect sense veryquickly so don't get turned off by that.9/10, heart-warming and really unique. Kimi no na wa is surely one ofthe best animation films in its genre of the last few years.
