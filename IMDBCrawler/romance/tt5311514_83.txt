Wow. I think I can say that this is the best animation film I've seen.The story is endearing, the characters too, the film is very beautiful,showing particularly beautiful landscapes and very realistic. The filmis interesting showing the difference between a Tokyo boy and a girlliving in the countryside, highlighting the difference of sex and inlifestyle but still being very structured, each having its sequences.The film takes on a very interesting dramatic appearance when the boy(Taki) looks for the girl (Mitsuha) and realizes that 3 years separatesthem as they "exchange" at the same time and the film becomes even moreinteresting, the whole completed by music of great art. So I can onlynote this film 9, at the limit of the 10, so much beautiful it is. Amasterpiece of Mr. Makoto Shinkai!
