Your Name is an anime film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (5Centimeters per Second, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, and The Gardenof Words). Based on Shinkai's novel of the same name, this film onceagain showcases the writer/director's ingenuity for telling a poignantstory while also featuring gorgeous art and animation.In the rural Japanese town of Itomori, high school girl Mitsuha dreamsof a better life, in particular, that of a young successful Tokyo boy.One day, Mitsuha wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy livingin Tokyo. Initially treating the experience like a dream, Mitsuha (inTaki's body) lives the life she has always wished for, at least untilthe day is over. However, Mitsuha soon discovers that she actually canperiodically switch bodies with Taki, and that everything she does ashim happens in real life but just like with dreams, her memories ofthese events quickly fade away with time.Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places, YourName is another fine entry into acclaimed anime writer/director MakotoShinkai's expanding filmography. Only somebody Japanese could tell sucha carefully intertwining story in such emotional detail. The film isvery reminiscent of other body-swapping movies such as Freaky Fridayand Face/Off, but with a unique eastern influence untouched by thehands of Hollywood. The Japanese voice acting is great and everybodydelivers their lines with just the right amount of feeling withoutseeming too sentimental or sappy. I have yet to see the English dubbedversion, but I plan to do so in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8.5/10
