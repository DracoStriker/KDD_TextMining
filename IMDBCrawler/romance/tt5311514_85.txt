This is a film that starts off as a rom-com and later develops into oneof the greatest film I've ever seen in my life. Some people might thinkthe plot is complex while some might think otherwise. However, Ibelieve that this film shows how director Makoto Shinkai really trustshis audience in putting the pieces together themselves thus proving howmature this film is, spiritually speaking (u'll get it once u watchit).Besides, the filmmaking technique is masterful and extraordinary. Ifcompared to his (Makoto Shinkai) other films, this is definitely thefastest in terms of pacing. Some viewers might not manage to keep up sothere is definitely reasons to re watch this film too many times. LOL.The editing really keeps the audience grounded, yet so free dreaming inthe fantastical experience that one does not realize that they havebeen longing for since a long time ago. This is surely a legendaryjourney that one should not possibly miss so don't forget to buy it onBlu-ray!Oh, and the animation, FREAKIN GORGEOUS!***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD***Moving on to to the romantic aspect of this 112-minute long film, thefeelings that developed between the main characters are shown quitesubtly before reaching the climax. I have to praise how director MakotoShinkai exploits the body-swapping element by making it happen tocharacters who are almost impossible to meet thus making the experienceof knowing each other much more interesting.
