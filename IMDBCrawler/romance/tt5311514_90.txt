I'm not an huge anime fan, but even I can see the quality in this film."Kimi no na wa" tells a story of two teenage kids, who swap bodies. Such a simple premise becomes (thanks to stunning visuals, amazingdirection, great plot and a extremely touching story) in one of thebest animated films I have ever seen. Close to Ghibli's standards interms of animation and imaginative story.Everything, from the character development to the animation worksperfectly to subjugate and move the viewer to the point where it wonthandle the tears. Not in a melodramatic and cloying way, but in acompelling and amusing way instead.This film will just amaze you.
