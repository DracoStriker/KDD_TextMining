The quality of animation and sound design in Your Name rival the likesof Akira and Studio Ghibli as does the level of creativity in itscinematography. These are what allow the film to generate laughter andthen tears in succession with no diminishing returns. Likewise, YourName is one of those movies whose plot repeatedly defies expectationsand whose premise the audience will not likely pin down until thecredits are rolling.Written with love and captivatingly delivered, Makoto Shinkai haswritten a story that would be done a disservice were it described onlyas a Slice of Life; a genre that Japanese animated and live cinema havealready redefined. It is a love story, an Epic, a coming of age storyand a comedy. Above all Your Name is quintessentially Japanese. Shinkaieffortlessly synthesises life in rural, traditional Japan with theWesternised cityscape of Tokyo, draws on shared tragedy and exploresthe dual natures of progress and the loss of one's history. Your Namealso bridges the gap between mythology and science-fiction. The effectof this blend is not to contrive the plot or overshadow the charactersbut rather serve to help realise both.
