FIrst off let me start by saying I'm not familiar with any works ofthis legendary Ghibli and their works, nor Shinkai Makoto's previouswork to compare this to any of that product. I'll simply write thisreview as someone who has seen the movie and find it enjoyable.As someone who has seen some Japanese animated works, I can say thatKimi no Na Wa is very well done. It is not your usual cartoon, there'reso much dynamics in the picture and note that the landscape are verybeautifully drawn and it really has very gorgeous scenes from time totime.The voice actors were brilliant, and I strongly suggest you see the subversion rather than the dub (I don't know how the dub will be done butthe Japanese voice actors is nothing sort of amazing, especiallyconsidering that they have to voice a boyish/normal girl and agirlish/normal boy throughout the movie).The plot is relatively simple, but some twist make it very special.While it's true that this theme of girl and boy swapping bodies is notentirely new, Kimi no Na Wa elaborate it more: showing the anxiety andenjoyment that the two have without abusing it's sexual aspects and inturns build a unique bonds between the main protagonists which maketheir struggle to find each other more meaningful.The feeling of Japanese culture can be felt throughout the movies, withtraditional symbols, such as ceremonies, braided cord, the shrine,forest, and also with dialogues, but it never felt boring as they arevery beautifully paced.The music are well composed, and well timed. They bring so muchemotions to the scenes. I have never heard anything from RADWIMPSbefore but they were brilliant on all singles they have on this movie.Anyway, it was a very enjoyable ride, and satisfying experience for me.It's a pity I have never got the chance to see it the 2nd time. If theyrelease a blue ray, I would try to get my hand on it. Also, I'llrecommend anyone who watch this search for the novel as well, itdescribes some of the characters' thought that the movie can't show.It's not really 'perfect'. There are some part of the plot that seemsquestionable, but for all it is, Kimi no Na Wa is a beautiful andenjoyable emotional ride, it will enchant you through it's 100 minutesduration.
