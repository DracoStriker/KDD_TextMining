Romance, cultural conflict, betrayal, compassion, and redemption. Allneatly wrapped within the context of a comedic memoir. MichaelSholwater did a superb job directing and the writing collaborationbetween Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani gave the audience awonderfully intimate sense of how the warmth, power, and growth of acouple relationship can expand and strengthen the bonds of family.No story or movie becomes great without a superb cast. Again KumailNanjiani proved his versatility with an amazingly strong performance(in my opinion award winning). And this movie was not a one man show,Zoe Kazan gave just the right energy to her role, Holly Hunter shouldget an Academy Award for best supporting actress for hers, Ray Romanowas excellent as were Zenobia Shroff and Anupam Kher. This was the bestmovie I've seen in a very long time and just may be the best romanticcomedy I've ever seen.
