I'm no prude by a long, long, longshot. But when I hear the leadactress declare that she has to take a "$#IT", I am somewhat takenback. Was that suppose to be cute? Did I pay money for my wife and I tosee this? In 'Butterflies are Free', an argument is made by theantagonistic playwright/producer, "Heroin addiction is a reality." Thewitty answer to this, "So is diarrhea, but who wants to see it on thestage?" Who wants to hear it in a movie script?Bad language doesn't bother me, but when it is applied haphazardly,apparently to evoke a shocking response, I realize the writer isn't tooexperienced and/or talented.Other than that, the film was somewhat tedious.
