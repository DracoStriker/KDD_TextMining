Ironically, Kumail Nanjiani, the lead actor in this film stands out asa terrible actor against the fantastic talent of Zoe Kazan, Ray Romano,and Holly Hunter. I say, "Ironically," because it is the lead actor'sproject and story! Zoe Kazan is adorable and charming as his loveinterest, but he is flat and wooden, which has the effect of creatingzero chemistry between the lovers in this romance. Additionally, there are random, out-of-character scenes forced into thestory which are unbelievable and clumsy. For example, when KumailNanjiani shows up at a drive- thru restaurant, the bit seems like it isfrom another character in another movie.Topping all that, the film keeps its emotional connection to theaudience at arm's length due to the insensitive directing that seems toprefer the syllable of every written line in lieu of nuance and charmthat may have been between the lines.
