Went to see this with my wife and we both had the same impression -underwhelming particularly given the rave reviews this movie hasreceived. At best, it was "cute" but it felt lightweight and as othershave pointed out it was not particularly funny or romantic. I wasdisappointed in Kumail Nanjiani given how good his character (andportrayal) is in Silicon Valley. Here he came over as somewhat flat andin addition I found Zoe Kazan as Emily irritating. Not a horrible moviebut kinda blah
