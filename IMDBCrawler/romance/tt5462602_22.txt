It's so funny how we all differ in opinions. I may think that "Shawshank Redemption" and "Godfather" are the best 2movies of all times.And some people may think that "Shawshank" and "Godfather" are boringas hell.So many people seem to love "Big Sick".Yet, I think "Big Sick" is one of the most boring movies I have everseen. Lame movie.As I was watching this movie, I was telling myself, "Okay, it's goingto make me laugh any time now. It should be a great movie. Any timenow."And it never did make me laugh or even get interested. A bunch ofnonsense dialogue.It just annoyed the hell out of me and made be feel bored beyondbelief.But this movie will probably be nominated for "Best Picture" comeOscar. I just think "Big Sick" sucks and is boring as hell. I hope it doesn't even get nominated for Oscars. I think the best movie of the year I've seen is "Get Out".
