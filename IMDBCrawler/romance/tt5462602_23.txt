Possibly THE worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to endure(well, half of it anyway - to avoid brain death and actually puking Istaggered out after what seemed the first 3 or 4 tedious hours.)Notcontent with making one big cliché, they then rammed in every othercliché they could think of. The acting - everybody - stinks (how onearth did Ray Romano and Holly Hunter get roped into this turkey? MoneyI guess. They certainly did not show any interest in the proceedingsand Romano at least had the decency to look embarrassed.)The productionvalues - well that's an oxymoron here. The writing is just appalling.The whole disaster is like a really cheap straight to daytime TV flick.When they are giving out free tickets around town in the second week ofrelease, be afraid. When the glowing reviews on the poster are all bypeople you've never heard of, run. Even tho my ticket was a freebie Ifeel like demanding my money back. And they can never repay me for anhour of my life wasted and the headache and nausea inflicted.
