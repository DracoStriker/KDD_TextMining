Best Judd Apatow flick, if you liked Superbad and 40yr old Virgin,laugh out loud moments (non-cheesy)then you will like this film.Funniest movie I've seen this year. You won't regret it unless you area racist bigot then obviously save your breath and time. Otherwise, gocheck it out, it's magnificent, we saw the Bigger Sick with 10 minbonus stand up to an empty theater (wtf people, it's amazing).
