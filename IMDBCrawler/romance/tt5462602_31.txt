This movie was disappointing. It isn't a very romantic comedy. Thecharacters don't seem to like each other that much. It isn't very funnyeither. The movie has a dark undertone. I feel like if I hadn't seenthis movie I wouldn't have missed out on anything. I would have ratherdone something else with these 2 hours of my time. By the way 2 hoursis too long for this movie.
