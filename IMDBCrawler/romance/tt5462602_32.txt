Non-Spoiler: This movie started out alright, kind of funny and givesyou the curiosity to see where its gonna go. But about half way throughit turns into the same old indie move with phony drama. Now most peopleobviously like it so I say you should try it for yourself. But if youdon't like indie movies in general, especially in the romancedepartment then I don't think you will like this movie.I especiallydidn't like how the Pakistani family was like the biggest stereotypeever, with zero heart or personality. Like the bad guys out of a Disneymovie. And the white parents are like the coolest bravest lion angelsin history. I think that could be why a lot of the American audienceliked the movie because they wouldn't get turned off by those types ofstereotypes. I am curious how Pakistani people rated it. But that wasjust a small gripe. Why I really didn't enjoy it is in the title, and alittle more detailed in the spoiler section.Spoilers: I hated it because the second half is all about drama and itbrings families together and is used as the main plot device (cancer),and its supposed to be heroic and cute and all that but not for me. Thedrama is so typical and boring and the ending is so typical and boring,I think you will not like this movie very much if you watch a lot ofmovies. If you casually watch movies it could be a great one to trywith the family. The reason I give it 4 stars is because if at the endof a movie after watching all this drama and sadness and "love" and idon't feel anything at all, then it wasn't very good at doing its job.In my opinion it is just rehashing the same old stories with an indietwist and a Pakistani twist, and for me that is not good enough at all.So if you are like me and Indie movies are really hit or miss, I wouldgo into this one with cautious expectations.
