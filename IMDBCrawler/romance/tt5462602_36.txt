All the actors in The Big Sick are accomplished and fit their roleswell. Kumail Nanjiani is sweet and relaxed as Kumail, the immigrantcaught between his American and Pakistani lives. As his whitegirlfriend Emily, Zoe Kazan is great - genuinely intelligent andsparky. Holly Hunter steals all her scenes as Zoe's firecracker mother,who comes to stay while Emily is in hospital in a coma. Ray Romano asZoe's father is interesting and thoughtful. Some big issues areexplored, such as what obligations do we have to our parents, andshould parents leave behind traditions like arranged marriage when theymove to the US? It's sobering to think there are families who shun sonsand daughters for marrying or dating outside their race. Or that somechildren feel they must have an arranged marriage - and must evenreject their true love - or else their family will disown them. ToWestern audiences, it seems distasteful, but the film acknowledges thatit's a complex and long held practice that many immigrant familiesbelieve is the best way to find their children a partner.The trouble with the movie is that much of it feels like a sitcom. Theediting is far too rapid. It hurt my eyes. Not much happens in thefilm. It's not at all a demanding movie. It's not that funny and itdoesn't take any risks. Which makes it a pretty standard romanticcomedy, but not an exceptional one..
