Holley was a hoot. Ray so so. BUT Kumail was just awful. First, thescreenplay itself presents him as a 'loser' comedian. We see him onstage and later he announces how he bombed at a major festival. Viewersshould believe that in spades since we (groan) have to sit through hislimp, failing comedic efforts.The core, interracial romance boiled down to a single scene that sealedthe nail in the coffin for me. Kumail admits that after many months ofdating and heavy sex he has hidden the fact he has never ever mentionedEmily's existence to his parents. Even worse, he announces, like akiller without remorse describing his crimes, how he never everconsidered any serious relationship other then his relationship withhis parents. Kumail had zero conflict as he says 'I can not give up my family' to ashell shocked Emily. There is no consoling or understanding. Kumail isangst free as he matter of factly, once the truth is made known, letsus know that while Emily was good in the sack and a dandy girl friendtheir relationship was never going any further then that.Emily's gut feeling, that Kumail's 'admission' was unforgivable was onthe money. He showed the feelings of a slug as she cried her heart out.Emily was also right to reject his lame announcement to wit: I'vechanged...!!! The movie should have ended there and then.In such a love conquers all movie the main characters mush show 'heart'(Kumail failed) and wear their emotions on their sleeves. Kumail againfailed. Perhaps one of the last lines summed it up....Kumail on stageannounces that she (Emily) gets more laughs then me. I agree.
