Not every indie comedy can buffet jokes about The X-Files and ISIS inpractically the same breath, but director Michael Showalter does itwith understated ease in The Big Sick. Be prepared to chuckle a bitover the pop-cult references and weep a bit over the heroine'shospitalization. Also be prepared to laugh about arranged marriages,Pakistani style, and a meet-cute that doesn't always bring a smile.The anchor of this layered comedy is Kumail Nanjiani, not only a subtlysmooth stand-up comedian but also a handsome leading man, whose low-keyapproach to ambition and love puts him in the pantheon of heroes whoare believable, self-effacing, and charming. The story is built aroundhis courtship of Emily (Zoe Kazan) based on his wife, Emily V, Gordon,who is co-writer of this warm, sentimental and ultimately realisticscreenplay.Perhaps that realism is just what so endeared me to this dramedybecause it fairly depicts the humor of competing cultures and thestrains of everyday life in stand-up comedy Chicago and the world. Yet,it is lighthearted rather than grim, with comic toss-off lines that begfor a return to the film to enjoy the ones you may have missed.You may also return to see the star turns of Holly Hunter and RayRomano as Emily's parents, Beth and Terry. The two pros can jump fromflip to serious in a flash. They alone are a whole film experiencewrapped in another film.The Big Sick is more mood and tone than plot, a quiet reflection of thecomplicated lives that face more than decisions about sleeping aroundor telling your family all about your life. Although you may haveexperienced the cute lover suddenly rushed to hospital in countlessother rom-coms, producer Judd Apatow has made sure you will laugh asyou enjoy his iconic comedies, now in a higher form than ever, and waxphilosophical at the slings and arrows of love in different cultures.
