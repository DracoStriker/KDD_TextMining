"The Big Sick" is packaged like a rom-com, and it has a low-key, no-big-deal vibe to it, but it slowly emerges while watching it assomething a little bit special. It's certainly a welcome antidote to the glut of other films currentlyplaying in summer movie theaters, if for no other reason that it's madefor adults. Kumail Nanjiani is utterly winning as a man trying tonavigate falling in love with a white woman and his traditionalfamily's expectations for him, which include an arranged marriage witha Pakistani girl. Holly Hunter and, of all people, Ray Romano arestandouts in supporting roles as parents of the girlfriend. The bestthing about "The Big Sick" is that it manages to lampoon stereotypeswhile at the same time acknowledging that stereotypes are frequently,if not 100% representative of the people being stereotyped, at leastpartially justified. But mostly it reinforces the idea that peopletranscend labels and can be many things at the same time.One of the better movies I've seen this year.Grade: A
