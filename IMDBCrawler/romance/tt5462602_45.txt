This is an amazing film. Not only is it an absolute triumph when itcomes to being a genuinely funny and entertaining romantic comedy, butalso an unexpected delight with regards to its dramatic story, filledwith genuine heart and real passion from start to finish, making TheBig Sick more than just an entertaining rom-com, but an incrediblyengrossing and emotionally resonating story for the ages.There's so much to praise about this film, but it's fair to say thatthe comedy is the very best part of it all. On the one hand, it's fullof fantastically funny gags that will have you bursting out laughing,not only poking fun at American and Pakistani culture, but also beingwitty and quick-thinking enough to keep surprising you with more andmore hugely hilarious jokes throughout the movie.On the other hand, there's something very heartfelt and real about thehumour here. This isn't in any way, shape or form a dumb romanticcomedy, but rather a film that shapes its sense of humour around theway the story is developing. So, when things are going well in therelationship, there's lots of light, hugely funny comedy, and whenthings hit a rough patch, the film manages to keep you laughing whilestill honouring the dramatic and emotional nature of the story.And that's where the film's biggest success comes in. About a third ofthe way through, the story takes a huge turn, and (without spoilers),completely changes the dynamic of the two lead characters'relationship, as well as bringing the parents of the woman into play,and allowing their bond with the man to be examined much deeper.All of that happens in some very dramatic circumstances, and they'recircumstances which you really don't see coming at all a few minutesbefore it all happens. Now, we've seen many movies try this, blend asweet and funny romantic comedy with a more dramatic and serious story,but for the most part, they rarely ever manage to mix the two genrestogether well enough, regularly losing their comedic prowess inexchange for something far more dour.In The Big Sick, however, the blend between comedy and drama couldn'tbe more perfect. Kumail Nanjiani expertly shows this in hisperformance, managing to portray his character's genuine emotionaldistress, and yet never losing his innate love for comedy and joydespite a difficult situation, something that shines through in thefilm's atmosphere brilliantly.The addition of the parents, played beautifully by Holly Hunter and RayRomano, is an extra strength, as we get to watch the growth of a deepand powerful bond between strangers in difficult circumstances, and yetthe laughter never dies, shining through and keeping the film agenuinely entertaining watch.And in that comes the film's true heart. Rather than trying to bemelodramatic and turn a once sweet romance into a tragedy, The Big Sicksticks with what you fell in love with right at the beginning: its joy.Without the continuing comedy and fun-loving characters throughout thefilm's more dramatic second half, its greatest strength would have beencompletely lost.What's more is that through using comedy, it replicates how real humanbeings deal with tragedy. As difficult as things get, real people willalways try to find the brighter side of things, and that shines throughin The Big Sick's beautifully real dialogue, full of well- paced andperfectly written conversations that mix people's grief and joy, witheach and every character trying their best to get through a difficultsituation in the only way possible, and that's what really made thisfilm stand out for me.It's a fantastically funny comedy, and it's full of brilliantperformances, but what makes The Big Sick really great is its heart.It's not a melodrama, nor is it a dumb rom-com, but rather a film withreal passion and heart that makes an utterly riveting and genuinelyentertaining two hours out of its story.
