I just watched "the big Sick" and it just blew me away. I mean like acomedy movie that is so complete; you get the good jokes , the drama ,a bit of romance , the high climax and the crisp smooth ending. It'sbeen so long, since a comedy movie was so good, well constructed andsatisfying. Solid story line and great casting and acting. Having thegood light jokes is the kind of rare asset in comedies nowadays. The movie doesn't only get you laughing but also the touching dramaabout family,love, and life that all of us could relate to, packed inone heart warming motion picture. The great idea about cultureclashes,norms , and taboos in the comedy frame was delightfullyprojected. It's unfortunate how a great movie never gets its deservedchance, like hidden gems.One of the most underrated comedies in 2017 PERIOD.....
