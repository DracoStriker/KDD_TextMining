Wow, it doesn't happen often that I don't finish a movie, but I justcouldn't go on. As much as my partner and I were looking forward toseeing this film, and as much as I loved Kumail in Silicon Valley, thewhole experience felt tedious and sometimes borderline cringe-worthy.It's like that guy at a high school reunion who enjoys telling his lifestories that only he finds amusing, self-indulgence taken through theroof. The few funny moments all make an appearance in the trailer andthat's about it, sadly. It's a shame, really, because the premise hadpotential, but the movie can't decide whether it wants to be profound,poignant, heartwarming or lighthearted, and ultimately falls flat onall fronts. In the end, it's too boring and scattered to be romantic,and too unfunny for a comedy, and so it's neither.
