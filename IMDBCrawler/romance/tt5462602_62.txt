Firstly it's important to say that I did not know that this whole storywas based on some true facts, what obviously changes some points Iwould suggest to turn things better! When you start seeing the movieyou probably believe you're starting to see some cliché action inthere. The funny guy full of stereotypes that casually meets abeautiful young girl. But the fact is that and some point I startedseeing myself as stretched and creating connections to the characters,not knowing what was going to happen next. When I reached the end Ireally felt a life experience: had lots of humour, sadness and a fullglass of unpredictability on experiences that makes people find theirown path.
