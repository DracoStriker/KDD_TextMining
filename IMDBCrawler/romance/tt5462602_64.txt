A comedy with the 'Master of none' style comedy of Anzin Ansari butwithout the grace and emotion from the comedian with Indian heritage. A very corny and kind roles from the protagonist Jumail Nanjiani andZoe Kazan but the true star (in this case, like secondary) of the movieis Ray Romano from 'Everybody Loves Raymond'. I haven't see him a verygood role since that show.In fact, I never saw him in any show since that so see him here is agreat plus for the movie.
