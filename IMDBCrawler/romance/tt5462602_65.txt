I went to see "The Big Sick" without knowing much about it, and thatwas great! I did see the trailer, but a long time ago (like months),and at the time that I went to really see the movie, I had completelyforgotten almost everything. And that really improve the experience!Well, talking about the movie right now, that was the most amazingthing to me. The fact that I have no idea about the ending of the truestory that it is based of, keep me stuck to my seat all the way.(Some SPOILERS FROM HERE, isn't that big, but, if you didn't see themovie yet, my advice is "see it, and come back here")In the middle of the movie I was certain about the end (in my head), Iwas like "ok, she probably gonna die" or "she will live, and they willbe happy forever". If I knew they were getting married in the end, thiswhole middle to the end would lose that weight for me. But thank god Ididn't know. This is my highlight about the movie, all the turns andbacks keep me really confusing about how it going to end.(END OF THE SPOILERS here)All the actors are great in their roles. Kumail Nanjiani is reallyfunny (I knew that already - Silicon Valley -, but is good to see agood actor like him gain more opportunities in the big screen). Themovie also has a amazing script, it goes to a really fun scene, to somedark and in a certain way depressive scenes, and it works!Problaby my only big issue with the movie is that it's too long,without 20 minutes (or something like that) I think it will be waybetter. The end is a little drawn.In short, The Big Sick is a great movie, that refresh a genre that isprobably way saturated right now, and that is really difficult to do.
