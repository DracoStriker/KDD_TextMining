Everyone just goes on about how supposedly great this show is & theyforgot about the illness part. Why refer to it in the show's title ifno one cares about it? I would think that's important. Don't forgetabout that part of the story. Why call it 'The Big Sick' if you're justgoing to ignore it? Isn't that what this is really about? It's in thetitle!
