The underlying awkwardness of Kumail working through his early stand upcareer while balancing an interracial romance that is rejected by hisconservative family drives a lot more than cheap laughs. Every momentfelt real, which is a rarity in Hollywood. My wife and I fell in lovewith all the characters and their imperfections. (Spoiler alert) The'breakup' scene is perhaps the most realistic and unscripted fight thatwe have ever seen on the silver screen. Not many movies deserve 10stars, but this is a classic for the ages.
