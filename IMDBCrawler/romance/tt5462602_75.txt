Couldn't figure out how Zoe Kazan was so good and I had never heard ofher, till I realized her grandfather was Elia "coulda been a contender"Kazan. And then, there's Holly Hunter, who IMHO should get the Oscarfor Best Supporting Actress. Not to mention, this is one "grab your heart" movie that should get theNobel Peace Prize if they ever gave it for movies. Though the moviewould have been just as good (or better) without the endless repetitionof the "F" word. You know, you can make a great movie without sayingF*** all the time. But, when you realize that the movie was made on a $5 million budget,and as of October 2017 it had already grossed over $50 million, youknow somebody did something right.
