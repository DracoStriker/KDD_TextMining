For a drama comedy the movie maybe deserves a seven in that specificgenre but as an overall movie a six is more than fair enough. I justexpected more humor, better jokes but even the stand up comedy momentswere a bit weak. They could have done better with that part in mind.The story itself is easy to watch, but it lacks something to be fullyentertaining. It's a bit boring sometimes but than again it's notreally my kind of movie genre. Kumail Nanjiani can be funny but it'snot in this movie that I thought he was the funniest. All in all it'snot a bad movie to watch once if you have nothing else to do. But Iwouldn't watch it a second time if it was up to me.
