When people say this movie is a gem, this is the movie they're talkingabout...I know, it's cliché, but, feces (really, IMDb? really?)...it'strue. I was SO looking forward to this, SO afraid it wasn't going tolive up to expectations...SO happy it delivered. Kumail is great, asalways, Hunter is endlessly wonderful, as always, and Zoe Kazan...everytime....is amazing...I could not be more in love with this person I'venever met if I tried. Were I to meet her, I would rip my beating heartfrom my chest and offer it to her as a sign of my undyingdevotion...all right, that's hyperbolic...a little. And then there'sthe story...jump in, turn off your phone, immerse yourselves and letthe world go away for a while.Did I mention I REALLY liked it?
