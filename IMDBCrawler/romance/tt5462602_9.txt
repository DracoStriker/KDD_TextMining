Like most comedies, 'The Big Sick' is powder-puff drama spiced up withsome humorous moments. Its plot tells how a Pakistani-American stand-upcomedian embarks on a love affair with a blonde psychology student whenshe heckles him during one of his stage shows. After she discovers hisfamily are pressing him to choose a Muslim bride for a traditionalarranged marriage, she breaks up with him but soon afterward falls illwith a serious infection. He realizes he's still deeply involved withher while keeping vigil at her hospital bedside - and when her parentsarrive, the three of them attempt to break through some culturaldifferences.The characters and story possess some originality and relevance, butthe film's effect could have been far more intense if it hadn't focusedprincipally on laughs. Despite the strong emotional content - love,family and ill-health - the film never escapes the clutches of lightcomedy. The actors deliver respectable performances, but their effortscan't lift the material above the level of a forgettable sit-com. KenLoach's 'A Fond Kiss' explores similar territory in a far morememorable manner.
