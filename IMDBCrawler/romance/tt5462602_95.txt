Now. First things first, I don't really like romantic films, and Idon't really like comedy based films. But when the two merge into aromcom, I just cringe at the thought of it. When I saw the trailer forthis film, I was like, OK, looks interesting, but I never reallythought to much about it. When I watched it today, I was just blownaway by how 'Smart' the comedy is. The way the jokes and comedy in thisfilm is delivered isn't like anything I have seen in rom coms.Normally, they would always be quipping and it seemed really 'Forced'.But the way the jokes and comedy in this film is delivered feels sonatural. I don't know if anyone else noticed this as well. As well hasit being a funny entertaining film, it's also very heart warming andmoving as the it follows the story of this Pakistani man in love withthis girl and him trying to make an impression on her parents, but atthe same time torn because his family has certain beliefs. I won't saymuch as you have to see it to believe it, but this is a hilarious, yetheart-warming rom-com and possibly, in my opinion one of the bestromcoms of all time. 10/10 Big Sick. :)
