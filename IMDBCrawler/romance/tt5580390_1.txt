This has absolutely so much going for it - beautifully filmed, with amagnificent, sweeping score and a stunning performance from SallyHawkins - but crashes and burns in sentiment, cliché and cartoonsupporting acts. It comes across, ultimately, as a cack-handed mash upof "E.T.", "Splash" and "The Creature From the Black Lagoon", as anaquatic man is captured and brought into a secret military Americanlaboratory in the 1960s at the height of the cold war, and SallyHawkins' mute cleaner develops a bond with it and, ultimately, falls inlove.Sounds interesting, doesn't it? It certainly has potential, but if thesassy black friend, constantly yammering on about her feckless husband(Octavia Spencer, surely tiring of this kind of role) doesn't get you,or the inefficient gay neighbour/best friend (Richard Jenkins - not hisfinest two hours) or Michael Shannon's cartoonish, 2D villain, thenstay tuned for the ghastly black-and-white fantasy dance number, inwhich Hawkins and the creature cavort on an elaborate set like Astaireand Rogers. It truly is a ghastly mis-step, jaw-droppingly stupid. Thefilm never really recovered for me, and it lumbered to its predictableclimax and ending with numbing melodramatics and sentiment.
