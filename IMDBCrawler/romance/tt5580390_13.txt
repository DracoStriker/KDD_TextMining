Just watched it at TIFF and as much as I knew it would be beautiful,nothing prepared me to be so very moved by the story, the way it wastold and the delicate details that make of this the most beautiful,moving story I have ever watched.Of course I cried more than once, and over 2 hours after leaving themovie theater (the same where the movie was actually filmed inToronto), my heart is still heavy in an uplifting and hopeful way.There aren't any words to describe this gorgeous piece of art... asusual.. the effects, the creatures, the colors and most importantly,the words of the narrator (just like in Pan's) move you to no end...
