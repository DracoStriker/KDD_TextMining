This is about a deaf mute cleaning lady learning to communicate insecret with gentle giant of a creature being experimented on andtortured by a US government agency. She pities the way he is treated and that leads to displays of kindnessand affection that are returned by the monster.It is a lavish production with a few twists and turns along the way; itis suitable for all. I think it will become a classic before long.A wonderful bonus was the way the two leading ladies played off of eachother.Truly a delightful film.At my screening there was a very memorable Q&A with the director that Iwould like to share.There were some rather technical questions about Japanese influences inhis film (I will look for when I see it again). The amount of time and effort to make a real (man in a suit) ratherthan CGI monster and that he financed it out of pocket for more than ayear before he got financing from Fox. A question about his colour pallet, and a comparison of his film withBeauty in the Beast from a little girl in the audience who spoke inSpanish.He used this question as a springboard to talk about a few topics thatwere on his mind. You might know the director is from Mexico and nowlives in Toronto. He went on to say that many of the problems in theUnited States are not the fault of Mexico. Also, that the reason that there is so much conflict in the UnitedStates is because it is intentionally being done by the government. It is pulling people apart and making them fight each other, because,it doesn't want people uniting together to go after the real problem,the 1%.He said this to great applause. I hope that he has an opportunity tospeak to many people about his view of America.This film BTW was filmed in Toronto and premiered in the theatre thatwas used for many of the scenes.
