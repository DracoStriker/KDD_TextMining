Seen at the Viennale 2017: it is good, they chose Sally Hawkins for themain cast. Very well done story telling. It is all a bit tooaesthetically. And too predictable. And all feelings are told. Therewas not much room for my own fantasies. Everything was shown. No spacein-between left. If you want to go to the movies for an evening forsheer, perfectly done entertainment - go for it!
