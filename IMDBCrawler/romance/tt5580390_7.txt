A friend of mine who liked "Her" like this movie. I can see why. Therewas no human good enough for each lead in each movie. I was looking fora "Splash" ending & I got it. Spinster and the Beast. And let'sdemolish the idea that spinsters are not sexual with plenty of handsolo examples. My friend obviously lives in a fantasy world ofsinglehood.
