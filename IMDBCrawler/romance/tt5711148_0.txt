Frankly, I was upset when Annette Bening did such great work in 20thCentury Women, which a few of you saw, and wasn't nominated for anOscar. Once upon a time in movies, people related to one another infunny, sad and flawed human ways. That was 20th Century Women and Ms.Bening was pushed out at Oscar time by that beloved film icon nominatedfor yowling and singing painfully off key. A travesty. Booray forHollywood. Assessing no blame to our nameless beloved scenery chewerbecause she can't help getting nominated for merely belching, with orwithout an accent. Now, having been swept away by Film Stars Don't DieIn Liverpool, I'm not upset anymore. Ms Bening and Jamie Bell had me at"How do I look?" Tough cookie 50's film star Gloria Grahame stumbledthrough her life without much love or tenderness. With Jamie Bell'scharacter Peter Turner, she not only found them but allowed them for alittle while. I wanted to be there for every moment Gloria and muchyounger Peter were together. Throw in Julie Walters as Peter's mum,Vanessa Redgrave as Gloria's mom, and, no-slouch-she Frances Barber asGloria's jealous toxic sister, and you've got a jewel of a film thatmay or may not get the recognition it deserves. But I've got mymemories of the great Julie Walters, as Peter's Mum, crushing me simplysaying "time to let go of her, son," and Gloria with her life scars andPeter trying to make it all better for her. And he does. Hollywoodcan't hurt me or Gloria anymore. She has passed on and my illusionsabout talent and fine work being rewarded are gone. It could happenthough that Ms. Bening, like Elizabeth Taylor before her, gets herOscar one year and one film later. This time, if it happens, it will begiven for this year's best performance by an actress. Because. trustme, it is.
