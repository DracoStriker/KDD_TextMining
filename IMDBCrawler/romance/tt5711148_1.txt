Annette Bening and Jamie Bell play star-crossed lovers, with theemphasis on 'star'. Ms Bening is, as ever, excellent, this time playinga real-life Hollywood actress, Gloria Grahame, herself a remarkable andoriginal talent. If this film rekindles interest in Ms Grahame'sformidable back catalogue of performances, that's no bad thing.However, FILM STARS...centres on Peter Turner, a jobbing actor whoselife takes an unexpected turn when he falls in love with Ms Grahame. AsTurner, Jamie Bell, who has developed into an accomplished supportingactor over the years since BILLY ELLIOT, is promoted to leading man.He's excellent. A revelation. Authoritative, sexy, strong, romantic,vulnerable -- you name it, Mr Bell communicates it sincerely, withoutany sense of artifice. A first-rate performance.It's a pity that the film is so hand-me-down in other ways. Theeverlastingly wonderful Julie Walters does everything possible with thestereotypical Liverpool mum that she's been provided with, but neithershe nor other stalwarts -- Kenneth Cranham, Stephen Graham, FrancesBarber and even Vanessa Redgrave -- can transcend their characters'functionality. Production values are all over the place (the wigs!),while the decision to use back projection for the scenes in New Yorkand California seems to me to demonstrate the inconsistency at theheart of the director's approach. Rather than expressing the rosy glowof memory, which I suspect was the justification, these scenes merelylook cheap. It might have been wiser to set the whole thing in astudio, as Joe Wright did with his ANNA KARENINA or Baz Lurhmann withhis MOULIN ROUGE. Whatever the flaws of those two movies, the overallartistic vision was equal to the project in hand. I don't think that'sthe case here, unfortunately.
