Having read the book I was looking forward to seeing the film.It isdisjointed and non linear,a handicap when telling a true story.Forexample places and year are flashed on a blink of an eye on the righthand side of the screen.There are many unanswered questions in bothbook and film.Why didn't she tell Turner about her cancer,marrying herstepson and her affairs with much younger men,of whom he was the last.
