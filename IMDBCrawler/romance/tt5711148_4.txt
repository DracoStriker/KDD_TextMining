Gloria Grahame is a female Woody Allen in the way that she took thevirginity of her stepson when he was still a teenager, then marriedhim. Well this movie is not about her relationship with her step son,and the male lead was already 28. But I can't help but wonder why willtoday's audience care to see her story? In 2017, Sexual harassment newsare contaminating Hollywood, so a movie sugar coating a sex predator'slast years might not be a good idea.Anyway, here's my review. I went to watch "Film Stars Don't Die inLiverpool at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It startswith a weak story, then ends a disappointment. The film focuses on thelast few years of long-forgotten Oscar winner Gloria Grahame's life,esp. her romance with then 28-year-old British young man Peter Turner.The two main leads - Annette Bening and Jamie Bell - gave pretty goodperformances (esp. Bening who is brave enough to show her age onscreen), but the whole romance just doesn't work for me. I know fromthe beginning the relationship is doomed because of the huge agedifference (28 years apart). They were fighting half of the time in themovie, and Jamie Bell's Peter had to see her dying eventually. Themovie is depressing, but I don't feel sad because I actually do notcare about either the characters or their unremarkable love story. Tome the only reason this movie is made is because the real Peter Turneris a long time friend with Bond movies producer Barbara Broccoli (theymentioned this on stage at the screening). The director's decision ofusing nonlinear narrative also fails. The story jumps back and forthbetween different years (1979-1981) and locations (Liverpool, LA andNYC),m. Sometimes I got lost a bit. In summary, this is a mediocreOscar vehicle for Bening, but she will lose again.
