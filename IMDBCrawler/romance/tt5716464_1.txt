Breathe has to be one of the most touching films I've seen in a while,you'd be hard hearted if you weren't moved close to tears as you seethe life of Robin Cavendish fall apart, and that of the family aroundhim. You also see the triumph of the human heart, how everything isdone to get him home. Having had a grandmother who was inflicted withpolio and disabled it brought a tear to my eye to remember, and thinkhow easy a disease polio was and sadly still is to contract.Andrew Garfield gives a wonderful performance, as does Claire Foy. Itwould surprise me if there weren't BAFTA nominations. The biggestsurprise for me was seeing the name of Andy Serkis, who made hisdirectorial debut, I would have expected him to be associated withsomeone slightly more unusual, but it's a promising start to that sideof his career. If I had one criticism it would be that the film wasperhaps too long, it did lull a bit in the middle.If you're going in expecting something light hearted, then don't go, asit will have you in tears, if you're expecting a gritty, true to lifestory of overcoming adversity, then this is one film I'd recommend.8/10
