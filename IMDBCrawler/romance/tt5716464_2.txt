Not perfect but pretty damn close to perfection . I've said it before the best films are based on real events . AndyGarfield deserves the best actor Oscar . This one will make you laugh ,cry and smile . One man's fight for survival against the odds with the loving supportof his wife and son who incidentally produced the film . Excellent casting , acting and directing by Serkis . Beautifulphotography a film that ought to be depressing was actually somewhatuplifting and you'll want to see it again and look up the real story . A British cinematic masterpiece worthy of an Oscar nomination. Pad.A 9/10
