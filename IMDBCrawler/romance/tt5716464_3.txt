30 October 2017 Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight -Breathe. Starring the very talented Andrew Garfield this is the truestory of Robin Cavendish who contracted polio in Africa in 1958.Paralysed from the neck down and only remaining alive because he wasattached to a respirator he fell into a depression and wished to beallowed to die. With the aid of his wife Diana (played by Claire Foy)who absolutely refused to give up on him, he left the hospital andmanaged to live a life which enabled him to be at home with his familyand watch his son grow up. Not content to stay at home he enlisted thehelp of a talented inventor friend (Hugh Bonneville) to help him becomemore mobile and this enabled him to travel and to show other poliopatients that there could be life outside their hospital beds. Filmsbased on true stories are almost always touching and emotional and thiswas no exception. An absolutely astounding piece of acting from AndrewGarfield, who for 80% of the film could only give us the character ofRobin by moving his eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth, yet he portrayedthis character with sensitivity and compassion without coming across astoo sentimental. Andy Serkis made his directorial debut on this film ,and it was co produced by Jonathan Cavendish, son of Robin and Diana.
