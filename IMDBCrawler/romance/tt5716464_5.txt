Breathing is the most natural thing on earth, right? But when Britishtea broker Robin Cavendish contracted polio in Kenya in 1958, he foundthat he was paralysed from the neck down and could not breathe withoutthe constant support of a mechanical ventilator. This true story istold with Andrew Garfield as Robin and Claire Foy as his wife Diana,both of whom give fine performances of nuanced emotion. Inevitably the film will be compared with "The Theory Of Everything"but it is no bad thing to be reminded that people with disabilities canachieve remarkable things. In Stephen Hawking's case, he was still ableto make great contributions to theoretical physics; in the instance ofRobin Cavendish, he transformed the treatment of those with paralysis,both in the UK and much wider.For first time director Andy Serkis, this is clearly a very personalproject. His professional partner and producer on the film is JonathanCavendish, the son of Robin and Diana, while Serkis's sister hasmultiple sclerosis. Serkis is known for his acclaimed acting inperformance-capture roles, but the only major use of special effectshere is to enable Tom Hollander to represent both of Diana's identicaltwin brothers. At the end especially, the heart strings are well and truly plucked,but it is gratifying to see such a well-made and life-affirming work onour screens.
