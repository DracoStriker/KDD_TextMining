I truly enjoyed this film that I saw at TIFF. Apparently a lot ofcritics were expecting something grittier from Andy Serkis. Jonathanand Diana Cavendish are 100% behind this film and I DO believe thatwhat is shown is true. Perhaps some critics wanted more darkness, but Ido believe with these peoples' zest for life, they didn't allow muchdarkness to cloud their love and triumph.I believe that Robin, Diana, and Jonathan enjoyed their time togetheras much as humanly possible. It is a love letter, a tale of triumphover adversity, and most of all it is a wonderful love story. Sometimesthere IS more light than darkness. Especially when you have talent likeAndrew Garfield and Claire Foy. Both are excellent in their roles,allowing me to completely immerse myself in this uplifting story.
