If you've read the book, you will not be disappointed. If you've notread the book, you must. They fit together as a beautiful worktogether. Companions in art. One without the other, and you just aren'tas fulfilled. I cannot wait to reread the book.Timothée's performance is one for the history books. The AdeleExcharpolous à la Blue is the Warmest Color of the year. His eyes areso expressive and every emotion and action is so deeply felt by thispoor tortured soul that by the ending you cannot help but weep and feelat the absolute lowest you've ever been.Armie is portrayed to perfection, as well. His "later" and otherphrases stand out so sharply in a world of prompt and prim dialect thatit makes us feel engaged in a way that I've never felt by a movie. Hewas such an outsider and yet we were assimilating to his was as opposedto the way it should be. He, a guest, in Italy, for 6 weeks, leavesjust as American as the day he arrived.Luca's obsession with men dancing and swimming pools and beautifullychoreographed sex, is perfect for this story. I cannot think of abetter match. Luca said in the Q&A afterward that he decided to changea few things from the book because not everything written in proseworks on screen in a cinematic way, and if you've read the book, youwill agree. He also said the author, who makes a small cameo in thefilm, thinks Luca's changes are better than the original form. So,that's affirming.Peach scene? Devastating. Sufjan's new songs? Devastating.This was a very sad movie but I loved every second. Let's hope Suspiriais even better. Luca G. might be the most exciting director workingtoday. It was a privilege to watch this with him and the amazing castand crew INCLUDING Sufjan. I hope Sony Pictures Classics doesn't messup the distribution/awards campaign. This deserves praise.Also, 10/10 opening credits/font. Luca can do no wrong.
