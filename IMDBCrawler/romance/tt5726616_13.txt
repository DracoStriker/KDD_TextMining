It is not often that films adapted from books capture the true essence,emotion and spirit of the book but for me Call Me By Your Name doesjust that. Superbly acted by a talented cast the film was a visual anemotional delight. Sensitively directed and beautifully shot with agreat sound track what was not to like. For me it was a coming of agelove story for Elio and something very special for Oliver. Simplycalling it a gay movie does it a disservice. It is much, much more thanthat. While the whole cast were strong the two leads, Armie, andTimothee just had that magic on screen. And Timothee Chalamet'sperformance was stunning absolutely stunning. His closing scene willbecome a cinema classic. Don't be put off by the gay tag this is abeautiful love story, sensitively told that surly anybody can empathisewith. Don't miss it.
