This movie captures every feeling a teenager can possibly feel withinthe span of two hours and ten minutes. The music plays into the movieso perfectly to the extent that it would take away from the beauty ofit all if the music was different. It's been said before but, withoutspoilers, the end credits are so overwhelming and emotional. IfTimothée Chalamet doesn't win an Oscar for his role as Elio then peoplewill be extremely upset for him, myself included. His work here isundoubtedly the most realistic and truthful performance I have everseen in my life. Oliver, played flawlessly by Armie Hammer, becomes acounterpart of Elio and it is striking to see the two become so close.This movie does take its time, but it is so natural that it doesn'taffect the film's impact whatsoever. Elio and Oliver's chemistry feelsso palpable and unscripted. Often in romantic films the script iswritten so that the characters act or speak in a way that directly andforcibly pulls the heartstrings. With Call Me By Your Name, however,it's as if you are watching a beautiful and giddy relationship unfoldin front of your eyes. Every emotion felt by Elio is felt by theaudience. The last third will completely drain you of emotion,particularly one scene with Michael Stuhlbarg. Along with the emotionfelt while viewing the film, it also manifests your thoughts afterwardsand hits you harder and harder as time goes on. Rush to see this assoon as you can; it is not only the best movie this year, but one ofthe best movies ever made and a timeless classic.
