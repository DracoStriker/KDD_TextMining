After years of famine this is feast year for gay picture-goers: two gaylove stories in two months. Scripted by James Ivory and directed byLuca Guadagnino, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME has all the rich texture andsubtlety of a 'classic' Merchant-Ivory production. It's 1983 and17-year-old Elio Perlman (Timothee Chalamet) is spending the summer athis parents' house in Northern Italy. A hunky American graduate (ArnieHammer) arrives to help his professor father with archaeologicalresearch. Elio develops a crush on the charismatic Oliver who,reluctantly at first, reciprocates. A summer of intense passion isbound to have a short lease as Oliver has to go back to the States.The two leads give deeply felt performances and the spirit of the 1980s? musically and morally ? is delicately evoked. Elio's dad (MichaelStuhlbarg, a near double for Robin Williams), supportive andnon-judgmental, is the dad any gay teenager would yearn to have.Cinematography and the music score are superb. At two and a quarterhours the movie is a tad too long and slow to take off, but theintensity of this love story exceeds GOD'S OWN COUNTRY and is very muchthe equal of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The mood reminded me very much ofJoseph Losey's THE GO-BETWEEN (1971). A movie not to be missed.
