I am so glad I went to see this film. The acting was superb all aroundbut Timothee Chalamet managed to steal every scene he was in. The finalscene, featuring a several minutes long shot of Chalamet was one of thefilms highlights.The soundtrack was incredible. It really suited the film and set themood just right. The cinematography was beautiful.No film has moved me like this in years. I walked out of the theatre,into the toilets and cried. Beautiful, heart warming, sensual... Ifthis doesn't win a number of Oscars, I'll scream. Go see it.
