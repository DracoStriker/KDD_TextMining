Timothée Chalamet sets the bar very high. He is entirely natural, younever feel he's acting, yet he communicates every skipped heartbeat ofhis character's love. Armie Hammer, meanwhile, impresses in acompletely different way as Oliver, an American arrived in Italy towork as an academic assistant for six weeks . Initially presentinghimself as an old head on young shoulders, Mr Hammer seems to shedyears as the story progresses, his spirit freed by his encounter withChalamet's Elio.The first hour of this remarkable film winds up the sexual tension toan almost unendurable pitch, as misunderstandings give rise to missedopportunities and missteps. The course of true love never did runsmooth....The film is not without flaws. Only an actor as good as MichaelStuhlbarg, as Elio's father (who is Oliver's employer) could convert aself-conscious, set-piece speech into the moving, compassionatedeclaration that we get. And although on occasion Luca Guadagnino'sdirection borders on genius -- including the astonishing final scene --it occasionally resorts to unsubtle symbolism that would turn intosomething comic if it weren't for the commitment of the actors. All that aside, I find many images, lines of dialogue, and MrChalamet's incredible intensity, haunting me. I expect this willcontinue for quite a while yet.
