This film is pure sensuality and emotion. You can see through thecharacter's eyes, taste through their mouths but most importantly youfeel, by God how you feel. Luca Guadagnino manages to extract the verybest out of his actors: Armie Hammer's performance shows unprecedenteddepth and Timothee Chalamet is the essence of awe inspiring acting,this film will land him an Oscar nomination at the very least.
