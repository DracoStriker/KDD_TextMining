I watched this movie tonight. It may difficult to say it is a totallygood movie, but the director really tells us a good story...in a rightway. The director changed the end of the story, although they are stillseparated. But I really like this new ending, at least Eliot still hashis father and the family. I feel empty after the movie. Fortunately,it is not for my ex-boyfriend anymore. I feel extremely bad for Eliotand myself who have passed that heartbreaking path by himself. InChinese, we called 'You Qing Ren Zhong Cheng Juan Shu', which meanswish all well, jack shall have Jill.Best wishes, to all of us!!
