Some very strange scores going on with IMDb at the moment. Four of uswent to see this yesterday, two were gay and the other two very liberallefties, so our distaste was not for reasons I can imagine other peoplewould hate this film.Three of us found this incredibly slow, far too long and were achingfor it to finish.They even managed to totally misjudge when to end the film. The onetruly moving moment was a conversation with father and son that waspowerful and brilliant, but they had to carry the film on even longerwith yet more slow and inconsequential scenes. Very dull indeed.
