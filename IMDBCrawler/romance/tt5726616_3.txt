*****This review may contain spoilers!!!!*****I have just finished reading the book. It is deeply moving. I am stillin a daze. Heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. The filmadaptation is erotic, cinematic, well acted, and painfully beautiful,as Luca Guadagnino's other film, I Am Love (starring the luminous TildaSwinton). What makes the theme universal? To my eyes, it has to do with thecomplex issue of love and loss. The film and the book deal withlove/loss not in the simple sense of losing the person we love, but inthe sense of deliberately losing the person we love so we can sustainloving and desiring the person. "I can't love you unless I give you up"could be the line (not from the book or film) that captures therelation between Elio and Oliver. Both Elio and Oliver maintain the minimal distance between them insteadof fully committing to their desire 'til the end. Which makes theirlove the sad kind. As Elio said, "Time makes us sentimental." The righttime never arrives for Elio and Oliver. They relate to each other fromthe lenses of the past ("pluperfect" love, to borrow Elio's wording)and the future. It is never now. The thematic is appealing because itspeaks to many of us who have loved and continue to love on the basisof the fundamental loss at the heart of desire. Is there a way out ofthis spiral? Is there another way of approaching love? These arequestions the book and the movie leave the reader/viewer to answer. Theending is unhappy yet "satisfying", precisely because this satisfactioninvolves a mix of hope and agony. It keeps the movement of desire inmotion, for both Elio and Oliver, and for the reader/viewer. PS: I can't help but reflect on this great film vis-à-vis Guadagnino'sanother great film, I Am Love, where the two protagonists literallyleave their respective worlds behind to be in a world that they bothshare.
