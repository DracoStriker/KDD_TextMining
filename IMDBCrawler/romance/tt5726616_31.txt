Not sure why general audiences need to be subjected to this tripe.For the several hundred people who get off on this sort of thing, Iguess it will be right up their alley. I have a sad feeling we're goingto see more of this deviancy at awards shows to appease a small butLOUD group of immoral people, who couldn't care about film; they justwant to push an agenda.I feel sorry for the Lone Ranger actor for having to take such anembarrassing role. I hope his career isn't over - he used to be a greatactor.
