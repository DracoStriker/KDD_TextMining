Timothée, btw, starred in three films I saw this year at 2017 Tiff.He is in demand and taking on difficult roles is the way to get largerones.It has an interesting premise, I imagine that all of the rave reviewsabout this film are in regards to its homosexual content, which quitefrankly doesn't really excite me, that being said, certain elementswere particularly well done.Specifically the acceptance of this by the characters parents in thestory.Particularly noteworthy are the words of fatherly advice given toTimothée's character at the end of the film.While pushing towards universal acceptance the director did includesome content that could 'gross people out' it also had some problemswith pace.This is based on a novel written by Andre Aciman and the words Imentioned before come directly from his book and looks at Americansfrom a European point of view.Thanks to the leads and filmmakers who came to the Q&As.
