Critics are drooling this fall over the Sundance hit, a drama about a17-year-old male student living with his parents in Italy who's wooedinto a homosexual relationship by a 24-year-old grad student played byArmie Hammer. None of the reviews from the major publications seemed toeven notice this age discrepancy.At least one homosexual author, Chad Felix Greene, has come out againstthe movie's promotion of sexual relationships between men and boys. Hewrote, For me it is simply an issue of responsible adultdecision-making. When an adult has sex with a teenager, they are beingselfish, fulfilling their own temporary desires. They do not recognizeor possibly even care about the impact that encounter can have on avery young and impressionable mind trapped between finding security inwho they are and assuming more wisdom than they currently have. Greenecame under fire from the left for his comments. Many people argued thatthe legal age of consent in Italy is 14 (as if that had anything to dowith objective moral values and ethics).The sheer number of people arguing in favor of an age of consent at 14? should be enough of a wake-up call."
