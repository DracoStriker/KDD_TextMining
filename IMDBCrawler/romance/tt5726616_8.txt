Simply put: the best film I've ever seen. This production with astellar cast and tremendous director and producers have made, throughmy eyes a perfect film. The characters are engaging, the emotions are raw and palpable.However, the chemistry between all the actors, are truly magnificent.You can relate, extraordinarily to the characters and the storyline ofa first love and the trepidation you feel when telling someone how youfeel and not knowing whether that will be reciprocated. Timothée and Armie have done a tremendous job in depicting honest andraw emotions and feelings and love that translate with audiences of anynationality and transcend barriers like no other film before it. This is the best film I have ever seen and highly recommend you view.
