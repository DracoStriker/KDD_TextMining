I LIKE 'pretentious' movies and films that speak to you on a differentlevel. THIS however was pure torture and while I feel that the creatorstruly wanted to say something, it was MORE THAN APPARENT that theydidn't have ENOUGH to say and so they filled it withmind-bogglingly-SLOW scenes. SPOILERS!I see that many have already covered the scene with the pie, but I feelthat they didn't quite get the point across correctly: You have a FULLFIVE MINUTES (although they feel like ten) of the main female leaddoing nothing but EATING A PIE! And yes, she does do well, in that itis meant to make you uncomfortable, but no film EVER, in the history offilms, needs a scene where for five minutes someone does nothing buteat a pie. Beyond that, it is not counting the ten minutes it took herto walk in the house, put her mail down, walk around, stand at thesink, find the pie ... OR for that matter, the five minutes earlier inthe film (I could be exaggerating about the time in this particularscene, but again, it felt like forever) where she drags a chest or boxof some kind to the curbside - and I must bring your attention to theuse of the words DRAGS. The scene is shot in painstaking detail andSLOWNESS as she does this, across her long front yard, THEN she goesback into her house. Honestly, it is just too much. This film should have been a short of some kind, or else it needed morework before it was released. Again, I applaud the creators in wantingto bring this film to the screen, BUT if you KNOW a project is notready or not worthy, WHY do it and insult your viewers with such trash?
