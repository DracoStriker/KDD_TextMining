This is a god awful movie, there is no story in it, the order of thescenes is messed up, and it doesn't make any sense.If the ghost is the lead male, then how come he sees his alive self andlater he's just poof and gone after getting an unknown paper from awall. ( And one thing I hate about ghost movies in particular is if the ghostcan manipulate objects in the physical world very strongly. Sure thereis a real incident of a ghost doing that if the ghost has really strongconnection to the physical world and powerful will but even with that,the object manipulation is just weak. Like in the old Ghost movie withDemi Moore, IMO that's how a ghost should be portrayed. A ghost thatcan manipulate objects in the physical world like humans do can be aperfect serial killer. )
