Current destiny of the universe is that it will KEEP expanding andeverything will eventually burn out--look it up yourself. AT the veryleast U would think the people in charge of the movie would get thatright. The only spoken dialogue a person can actually clearly hear inthe whole movie is completely wrong in its "deep meaning", jayzus.The stuff with ghosty going forward in time, then backward in time wascompletely pointless and inexplicable. I guess the happy viewers tiethis in with destiny of the universe for a "deeper" meaning.Highly overrated
