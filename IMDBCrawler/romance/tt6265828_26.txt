We watched the whole movie even though I wanted to turn it off within 5minutes. There was maybe a total of 10 minutes or less of actuallytalking and the longest running talking moment was annoying to say theleast and difficult to follow what the person was actually trying tosay. The worst part was the ending, I will never know what the notesaid.
