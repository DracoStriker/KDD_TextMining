This movie is so boring. I watched to the end hoping for something tohappen. There's hardly any talking in it and definitely no action. Itmakes no sense and it's truly the slowest movie I've ever seen. Thecamera person focused on the wife and the so-called ghost for way toolong. Don't waste your time checking it out as you will be asdisappointed as I am.
