Someone else used the word 'pretentious' when describing this film. Iagree. Dear God just how many mood images can you use? How many silentpauses can you endure? I also absolutely agree with whoever said thebedroom scene at the start is tortuous. We actually and genuinelythought the film had frozen! That was until , after about three minutesof looking at them holding each other in bed, we saw his left arm move.I have just turned it off. Exact time? 13 minutes and 12 seconds in.Life is FAR too short to sit through drivel like this. It's what Iimagine a film student might knock together. Something that they haveused as a vehicle to 'ply their trade'. The only thing needed tocomplete the absurd pretentiousness of it was to film it in black andwhite....and possibly subtitle it.All the others in here who rave over it are just trying to be trendyand pseudo intellects. I imagine they like clicking their fingers atjazz festivals to show their approval. Meh. I would choose a good story, plot line and riveting acting any dayover this sort of claptrap. Wind River. Now there's a belting film!
