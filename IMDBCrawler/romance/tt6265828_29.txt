I get the theme behind the movie, but found myself bored and lookingfor something else to do. I would not really call this a horror movieor a thriller - you will not be on the edge of your seat. It was tooslow and depressing. There is very little dialogue and almost no plotto this story. Glad I did not pay to see this at the theater.
