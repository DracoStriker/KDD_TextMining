Wow what a total failure of a film. I'm not sure what this movie wassetting out to do but entertain was surely not it. Here is an exampleof what to expect in this pretentious art piece. 10 minutes of dialoguefree shots of a woman doing the dishes, some kitchen chores, eating awhole pie then going to bed. None of these things are done in a waythat justifies them being on screen let alone being on screen for morethan one minute.This film could have been compressed into a 10 or 15 minute short filmand it would have maybe got a 7/10. In it's current form the only thingsaving it from a 1 is solid enough cinematography and a good score.
