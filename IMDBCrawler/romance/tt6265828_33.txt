This film is completely awful. At times i thought i had accidentallyhit pause on my controller because the scene was just frozen forsometimes 20 seconds at a time. Every scene was 80% longer than it should have been. Patheticallyboring crap. Like watching something in slow motion over and over. SKIPTHIS FILM!Trust me if you DO END UP watching this have the controller and fastforward button if you want to get through it. I can't see any reasonwhy this is rated 7 apart from bots boosting the rating.It is very rare that i can't watch a film. Complete boring mess withbarely any words spoken. I see the idea but the pathetic director couldnot even come close to executing it.I will in future always avoid this director's films. They can't direct.They should give up directing. Truly.
