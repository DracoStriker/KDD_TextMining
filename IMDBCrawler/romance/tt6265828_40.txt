(SPOILERS AHEAD BEWARE) (Not that you should care as this movie is badbut i'll be polite anyway) This can't be for real, it just can't. How did this happen? And how didthis actually manage to get such great reviews?! This is an empty andpretentious movie where nothing at all happens. There are 5-10 minutescenes of a "character" doing something totally pointless while a ghoststands in the background watching silently while not moving. Its almostcomical. A good example of just such a scene is when Roony Mara tediously comeshome and does some boring things such as sorting through mail andwatering a plant and then proceeds to eat a pie for 7 minutes straightwithout anything else happening until she throws up. Sitting throughthat scene was just painful. The movie is also unintentionally funny. A good example of that is when Casey Affleck first becomes a ghost. Seeing him walk around with abig white blanket over him with two eye holes cut out looks silly. Itslike what a 5 year old would wear for Halloween if he was going as aghost. The whole movie has this deathly serious tone but every time yousee this you just want to laugh. Another good example of unintentional hilarity is when two ghost aretalking too each other with subtitles. Neither one is moving orspeaking so how the hell can they understand one another? Throughtelepathy? I don't know but it looked hilarious. So in summary this movie was painfully boring with nothing ofsignificance happening in its 90 min run time. Its 90% coma inducingand 10% unintentionally funny. Do not watch and do not trust all thesepositive reviews. Trust me.
