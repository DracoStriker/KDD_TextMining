I cannot contemplate how this movie got such a high rating. Not onlywas this movie a complete waste of time, it was not ethereal as thedirector indicated in his trailer commentary. Believe me, I looked forredeeming qualities. The only philosophical question posed in the moviewas not countered with other opinions. A question or two were asked,but it didn't seize the opportunity to use the moment to reallyquestion life. It gave a single version, while perhaps not mainstream,it was also not a mind-blowing revelation. The next conundrum Is howthe past and future overlap. Or did it? Did history, literally, repeatitself? Is this meant to support the theory addressed in one of the fewscenes to include dialog. Does this mean all other theories aredebunked? We are not given even that much from the movie. Finally, theone action that actually had some merit, the note, we are not given anyanswers. I waited, only to find out about the note. I realize thatdoesn't matter what it said, per se, just that it was written and left.However, it still became the catalyst for him leaving. What was someaningful that he waited all that time, passed up his opportunities to"move on", only to have this note be the reason. My advice: Meh! Don'tbother.
