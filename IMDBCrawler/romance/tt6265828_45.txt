My wife & I attempted to watch this last night. The film was such aplodder and filled with long, long camera shots, so long in fact thatwe were starting to doze (hence the term dozer, and I don't mean thebull type). The producers and directors of this film should've watchedthe original Ghost Story before embarking on this folly. We had to turnit off or fall asleep. One thing is for sure though, Casey Affleck musthave been exhausted after memorizing all the lines of dialogue for hischaracter in this movie.
