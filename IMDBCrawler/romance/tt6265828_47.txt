I'm a huge fan of Rooney Mara. Her stage presence is ...well...it's herstage presence that is mainly responsible for her being a highlycoveted actress. Sure..give someone like her a role in the Yellow Pagesmovie..and she will sell tickets. And, this is what Lowery and companymust have been thinking. Yea-- let's make an extremely BORING story andshow Rooney here and there..and let's have another A-list actor- CaseyAfflek-disappear like a Ghost and hide under a ridiculous bed sheet forthe rest of the movie. Let's have NO real acting..and rely on situationdrama...that has NO DRAMA...NO INTEREST ! I had to actually stopwatching the movie when Rooney was sitting on the floor eating a piefor what seemed like eternity. There is no action..no drama...nothingthat pulls us in whatsoever. In short-this movie is either one of theworst ever made--or was done purposefully bad...to show how gulliblethe critics and audience are...the joke being on all of us that watchedthis movie.I did not pay to watch this movie...and i still want my money back !!!
