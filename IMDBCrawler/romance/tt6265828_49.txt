I'm an European and I am used to watch art movies, love them, love thegenre but this is not good. At all.You need more SUBTLE and original details in shooting static & longscenes. I know is hard making a movie without all the CGI circus andthe Hollywood superficiality crap but that's why a lot of directorsstay away from the genre. It bore me to death watching characters going through normal humansituations without bringing anything new to the scene. You know, youcan tell someone is sad without using tears and sad faces. Withoutsuper sad music. There are techniques and stuff but you really needtalent to do this. Something that is not present in Wisconsin as I seeit...
