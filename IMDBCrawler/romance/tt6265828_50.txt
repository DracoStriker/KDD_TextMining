I must admit I didn't watch it till the end. In fact, I had it enoughwhen the main character and the only reason why I watched this movie(Rooney Mara) eat the pie for 10 minutes, or it was maybe even more.Also, there is a scene where two ghosts talk to each other, and ifafter that you are still watching this movie then you can watchanything.Good critics are probably because the critic writers actually need towatch the movie to the end and when they did that then they made a jokeby making this movie high on rating, so more people go watching andlaugh at them.I know I will recommend this movie highly to someone just to have ajoke on them.
