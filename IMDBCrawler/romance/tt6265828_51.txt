If I could I would rate this in the negative 7-8 star range.******Spoiler Alert***** Nothing, not a damn thing happens. Someonewalks around in a giant double king size sheet with two childish holescut out for eyes...Casper would've been a better look...for 9/10ths ofthis drag out. I just kept fast forwarding and missed nothing becausenothing happens. Not even the last scene where the sheet digs at thewall, pulls out a piece of paper, the eye holes stare at the paper fora second and then *POOF* the sheet collapses. The End. Noseriously...that's how this 90 min, that should have been a 5 min.short, ends. I've taken better shits then this.Hollyweird thinks a lot of itself. They're under the distinctimpression that the general public are stupid enough to fall for aspooky ooky picture of what children envision ghost to be and slap avery 2nd grade title to it and the general public will fall overthemselves to pay to see this goo. Thank God I paid not a cent to seethis. I am up to here with the obviously paid fake reviews. At the time of myreview, this is rated 7.6. My rating = Negative 7.6, it's THAT BAD!!
