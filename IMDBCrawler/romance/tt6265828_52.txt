Couldn't be more disappointed with this film. Seems like nonsense 1styear film student stuff. Music was good, but the story was so dull,characters were dull, action was dull. Could be forgiven if it was atleast clever, there is a tiny twist but nothing to write home about. Ifyou like the idea of sitting and watching someone eat their dinner incomplete silence then you will probably love it though.
