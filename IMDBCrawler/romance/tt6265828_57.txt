I rarely rate movies with 1 star but this time I decided to make anexception for this piece of garbage that dares to call itself a movieand no I am not exaggerating. I have never been that bored watching amovie but I guess that there is a first time for everything. 'A GhostStory' is simply an empty movie full of blank scenes with no dialogueor action that makes you think that the filmmakers just forgot that thecamera was rolling and just left. I just gave up on believing thatsomething exciting was going to happen after a 10 minute scene ofRooney Mara eating a pie. Seriously that happened. To be honest after acertain point I was so bored that I just stopped paying that muchattention. Many might say that it had meaning and it wanted to show theaudience the life after death from a different prospective but let's behonest with ourselves: Even if that was true the movie is sounbelievably blank and boring that you are going to lose every interestyou had to pay attention to its secret messages. I wouldn't watch itagain not for 1 million dollars and I suggest you to stay away andwhatever you do just don't watch it. Believe me any another movie willseem more entertaining than this one!
