How in the world did this move rate a 7.4 on IMDb!!! I don't care howartsy fartsy or worldly you are, this move SUCKS. I actually felt likeCasey looked. Such a waste of talent, but then Casey's last movie(Manchester by the Sea) also made me want to shoot myself. I am wastingtoo much money on movies that absolutely suck the life out of me.
