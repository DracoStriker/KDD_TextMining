Where to begin... Well for one thing, how the hell has it got a ratinghigher than 1??? This was a terrible film, so boring and pointless.Actually, it was probably my fault because every film with CaseyAffleck has been boring. Not sure if I'm allowed to swear but not onlyboring, but crap. Just as bad an actor as his brother Ben. It's likethe script writer writes a crap script and thinks "Who shall we get toact in this crap film? Oh I know, one of the Afflecks! But it is apretty crap script so it'll have to be Casey yet again...!!!" And thereyou have it! Oh, and who wants to see the woman eating a full apple piein real time or watch the husband in the morgue under a sheet for 5minutes. I mean, I actually had to check to see if I had my computer onPAUSE! So, my advice, stay away... stay 'very' away from this film.You'll thank me! Honest!
