I expected this movie to be quirky, and charming, but it was just dulland I couldn't wait to leave the cinema. I really like to see thepositive side of things, but I actually struggled to enjoy anythingabout it. I spent most of the movie just being agitated and reallysearching hard for something to like, but I would have to say thismovie is a top contender for the worst movie I've ever seen. Nothinghappened, I felt nothing and got nothing from it. 0/10 would recommend.
