This was an incredibly boring movie...Do NOT waste your time watchingeven 3 minutes of this movie. Don't watch it sitting therethinking..."it has to get better" because it never does. Seriously, mywife just sat there saying "it has to get better" and "there has to bea plot twist"...it didn't get better and there was no plot twist. I'mstill in total awe that Rooney and Casey accepted these roles...howdesperate are they??!! They have just topped my list of most boringactors ever. I guess you probably get my point by now! By the way, Thismovie has now become my least favorite movie EVER...taking the place ofAvenging Angel (1985) starring Betsy Russell.The thing I'm most upset about is that I wasted 1.5 hours or my lifewatching this movie...don't waste YOUR time!! Whoever reviewed this asa good movie was either very stoned or playing a joke trying to getpeople to watch this movie! Soooooo scarily disappointing!!
