I recommend watching it in 3X fast forward. You won't miss a thing andyou will still have time to watch something else. You should wait a bitto start,till you see a ghost. Don't worry about any dialog. Notnecessary to the story. An occasional push of the play button willconfirm your choice. Once you see some credits push eject and move on.PS Nobody knows what is on that dang note.
