Why anyone would bother making a movie like this is indeed a mystery tome...So happy I was able to fast forward during the slow redundanttheme....only to be disappointed over and over again. Casey and Tricia(Rooney) are excellent in everything they do... storyline is not afault of their's. Literally getting through this movie even at fastforward was torture. Do not wast your time. Most of the positivereviews I read before hand must have been written by boring, lacking oflife experience, pseudo intellectuals who love the sound of their ownvoice and find reviewing a platform. I resent being misled, spendingthe money to buy and time to download the movie. I will in the futurewait for more reviews to be written and be more discriminating in myevaluation of them.
