I love this film. Common themes of love, loss and the passage of timeare explored here in ways I've never seen before. Beautifulphotography. The relationship between Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara iscompletely convincing, which makes the events all the more sad andheartbreaking. The director David Lowery challenges his audience tothink, which apparently a lot of other reviewers here either weren'twilling to do, or aren't capable of doing.For those looking for a conventional "scary" movie, look elsewhere.
