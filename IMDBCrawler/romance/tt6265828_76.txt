Only if you're into pseudo-intellectual bull malarkey will you thinkthis film is worth viewing. I really can't believe I watched the wholething. I guess I kept waiting for more of the briefly given humanitybetween the two primary characters, a married couple who obviouslydeeply love one another but see life quite differently. After the fatalaccident, the spectral movements of the ghost are nonlinear, whichmakes no sense since scents of the afterlife we have allenjoyed--whether we believe in life after death or not--tells achronological tale of birth, awakening (hopefully), death of the body,and then eternal life. So, what do we have here? Concepts of ghosts andtime travel and bereavement and drunk 30-somethings and even thehistory of a pioneer family (the littlest girl we assume being thefemale protag's great-great- grandmother). If I were the producer ofthis film, I'd be blacklisting the director and demanding my moneyback. This one had great potential, but watch 'An American Ghost Story'instead. It's better.
