This Sundance Film Festival hit tells the story of a couple, played byRooney Mara and Casey Affleck. After Affleck's character is killed in acar accident, his ghost comes to life (portrayed as simply a whitesheet.) The film uses its seemingly simple plot to be a thoughtfulmeditation on time and our lives. While the film is slowly paced andthere is no doubt that mainstream audiences would likely be bored,those with the patience to watch and absorb the unique details andthemes presented in this film will be greatly rewarded. The film'ssimplicity is one of its strongest assets as well. Even a simple sceneof Rooney Mara's character eating pie for several minutes turns out tobe an emotional powerhouse that is incredibly effective at creating asense of empathy in the audience. A unique score also creates feelingsof both sorrow and, occasionally, tension among the audience as well.It ends up contributing to the meditative feeling of the film, whichmay remind viewers of some of Terrence Malick's more recent films (in avery, very good way.)My only real criticism of the film was that it could have done a betterjob making the audience feel more for the ghost character.Additionally, while I liked the score overall, there were a few momentswhere it felt a little out of place. But other than that, this is atruly original piece of film that shows that in the world ofindependent filmmaking, sometimes 'less is more.' While I like a goodblockbuster as much as anyone, it really--and undeniably--is great tosee such an interesting movie that did not need a big budget to make.Definitely recommended. 8/10
