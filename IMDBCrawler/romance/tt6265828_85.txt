I'll start off by saying I have a pretty high tolerance for art-house,slow-moving films. But if lack of action, dialogue or story bores youto tears, you'll probably hate this film.I didn't necessarily dislike the movie, but I simply found it 'okay'.There are some nice shots, it has an interesting premise, but it simplywent on too long.Basically the concept is a 'What If' scenario... what if the afterlifeall one can do is observe their surroundings. Or basically observe,discounting thrown dishes and flickering lights.And the problem of course is it'll be monotonous. As a philosophicalquestion, it's interesting... but actually watching monotony isn'tquite as interesting. Very little dialogue, very little plot, andseveral scenes don't quite have the impact they should.The followup scenarios with the Spanish family as well as a pretentious'philosophy of nothing matters guy' were a little disappointing. Infact, the speech of the followup tenant (again, I'll call him 'nothingmatters guy') is the point where I felt the film was trying too hard... trying to be weighty and deep, but it came across as forced andpretentious.And I'm not sure if it's just me, but I'm getting sort of tired seeingRooney Mara basically play the same exact role in every film she is in-- the sullen, brooding girl. Here her big scene is eating a pie. Andif that doesn't sound so thrilling... well, it isn't. Affleck does agood enough job, but he's barely in the movie (discounting the sheetversion).Anyway, some interesting ideas, the time-loop idea wasn't bad, theoverall idea wasn't bad, but it'd make a much better 45 min film than a1.5 hr one. It comes across as if Terrence Malick was told to make ahorror film... I expect this is what it'd look like, more or less.
