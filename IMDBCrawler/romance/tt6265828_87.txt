I don't get the hype surrounding this movie? It was an OK story-line,but painfully slow and boring in many parts. Highly overrated in myopinion. I enjoy some movies with little or no dialogue, but this wasextremely difficult to watch at some points. The pie scene is nearlyunbearable. This is a perfect example of a producer that tries too hardto be cute and different, and the result is a movie with a plot that isinteresting but at the end it leaves you saying "Is that it???" Thiswould've been better as a music video.
