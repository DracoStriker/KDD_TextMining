Waste of everything, including my time to write these lines, but I doit as a warning for those who fall under the pretentiousrecommendations of "artsy" chronicles. This movie is a ghost, empty andwrapped in an almost white drape. Casey Affleck's acting was notrequired for most of the movie, a broom below the drape would have beenas expressive. There is no real or new message, images are average. Asto the pace of movie, I would recommend it either for torturingterrorists or as hypnotherapy (even for severe cases).
