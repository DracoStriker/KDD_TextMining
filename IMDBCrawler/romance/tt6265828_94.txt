I really don't mind if a movie is slow if it adds to the meaning ofwhat the writer is trying to express. This movie was extremely slow,with long drawn out scenes where little to nothing is happening. Also,the writer jumps from one scene to the next with no explanation of whatjust happened. For instance, the lead character was there and then wejumped to the auto accident where he is killed, no explanation of whatactually happened. The rest is just plain confusing. The ghostcommunicates with a neighbor ghost with subtitles. He does somepoltergeist stuff when new families move into the house. He reads anote his girlfriend has left behind without showing the note to us,then he vanished. He goes back in time to watch a family get murderedby Indians and hangs around until they rot. Why? I don't like to guesswhat the writer is saying and this writer tells us very little. It wasworth seeing though. But be warned, drink coffee first or you may fallasleep.
