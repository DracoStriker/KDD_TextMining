'A Ghost Story' is a powerful film with very little dialog and a manwith a sheet over his head. That being said, it's amazing andheartbreaking.I wasn't sure what I was in for when I started watching the movie. I'vewatched it three times now, and I still haven't seen the end creditsthrough the tears in my eyes.A true masterpiece.
