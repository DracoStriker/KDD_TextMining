I saw the trailer and read the summary of A Ghost Story. I wanted somuch to like this movie. The story is intriguing and the trailer leavesyou wanting more. Young couple, very much in love, and sudden deaththat changes everything. It seemed like there would be some sort ofinteraction or progress in coming to terms with the situation, but no,just years and years of loneliness while life goes on without you.Unfortunately, for me, the movie left me wanting to fast forward. It'sfilled with a lot of silence, staring and long drawn out scenes. Thepie scene.....ugh. I suppose the lengthiness of the scenes are intendedto get you thinking about life and death, for a longgg time. Mythoughts and feelings felt like the main action of this movie...and itwas depressing more than anything.
