First off. Some people are calling this a horror movie. It is not. Thisis a mysterious drama-thriller with supernatural elements, and just theslightest hint of horror. Now, I expected this so it was OK, but beaware. Expectations is a movie worst enemy!OK! So Thelma is beautifully shot. Thought has gone into each scene,and each camera angle. The movie overall is very calm, kinda quiet.Eili Harboe is excellent as the titular character. The other charactersare good too, but she stands out. She has a very natural way of acting.Also she is beautiful, and so is Kaya Wilkins, which plays her newfriend. Gorgeous people.Like I said, Thelma is a calm, low key movie for the most part. I didthink it dragged just a tad in the middle part, but both the beginningand ending is pretty good. It has certain romantic tendencies, but itwas done in a not annoying way. Good.The are some scenes with CGI here, and they are very well done. Youalmost won't notice they are CG, except from the fact that you know youare watching something impossible. That's good. Thelma is not heavy onbig effect stuff, but the effects that are, are excellent.Joachim Trier is Norwegian movie critics golden child. They love himover here. Personally I'm no big fan, but then again, Reprise is theonly movie of his I've seen, so I can't really say. But Thelma is thekind of supernatural movie movie critics are actually allowed to like.Because it's kinda artsy, ya'll! ;) Anyway, I liked it, didn't love it,but maybe I will later? I doubt it, but who knows! Know what you are infor, and you will probably like it too!
