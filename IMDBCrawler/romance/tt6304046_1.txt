Imagine a film that is part Carrie and part The Exorcist?combined witha lesbian love story. I know that sounds a bit confusing?but this is apretty accurate summary of the picture.When the story begins, young Thelma (Eili Harboe) has gone off tocollege and things seem pretty normal. However, out of the blue, shehas what appears to be a grand mal seizure that lands her in thehospital. Soon after, one of the folks who witnessed the seizure, Anja(Kaya Wilkens) introduces herself to Thelma and they soon becomefriends. In fact, over times they become more than friends as both thewomen begin having sexual feelings for each other?which causes Thelmato have a huge internal struggle because this violates her strongChristian upbringing. A bit later, Thelma enters the hospital fortesting to determine exactly whether or not she has epilepsy. Duringthe testing, her defenses are lowered and her intense feelings for Anyarun wild?so wild that Thelma's supernatural powers manifest themselves.What exactly are these powers? And, what family secrets are thererelated to all this? And, how does this all end?As I said, the story reminds me of a couple other films but it's alsooriginal in many ways. It also keeps you guessing?and that's thebiggest reason I recommend the picture. Where all this is going and howit gets there make this a very special film, though I have a coupleimportant warnings. First, there are lots and lots of flashing lightsand epileptic viewers might have difficulties with this. Second, if youhave a strong fear of snakes do not watch this film! There are severalsnakes in the film but one incredibly vivid dream that is nightmarefodder involving snakes and you need to consider this before you seethis excellent movie.
