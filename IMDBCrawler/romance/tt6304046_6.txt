Norwegian film maestro Joachim Trier sure knows how to cast a spell. "Thelma" is a freshwoman on campus, experiencing the tentative flingsof adulthood freedom, attempting to cut ties with her helicopteringparents, engaging in the forbidden fruit of self- discovery, andexperiencing some orgasmic seizures to accompany her supernaturalvisions. Whew. Sounds cluttered, but tis not.Trier unravels his gorgeous Gothic tale with chilling deliberation,wringing suspense out of calm passages, cinematic vistas, shadowycloseups, and sprinkling small reveals like breadcrumbs for theaudience to find their way home.A bit of Hitchcock, a bit of "Carrie", a bit of Bergman, "Thelma" is abeautifully brooding piece of film tension littered with severalstunning visuals. It is to die for.
