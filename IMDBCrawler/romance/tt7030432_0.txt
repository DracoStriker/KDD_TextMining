I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 400 Christmas MOVIES.BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITSA POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION.NOW I HAVE NO AGENDA! I AM HONEST! I REVIEW Christmas MOVIES AS A WAYTO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN!Hallmark seems to cast the same ladies in their films. I think itsgreat. It seems every year they have Candace Cameron, Alicia Witt, ErinKrakow, & Lacey Chabert in a Christmas film. To me Lacey always has afilm that I enjoy watching. SHe is now like an old friend you seeduring the holidays. Here she shines again in this drama that plays toher strengths. In this film: A struggling pastry chef Kylie Watson (Chabert) learnsshe's made it to the finals of the American Gingerbread Competition,she thinks her competitive spirit has finally paid off and hopes thepublicity will help her jump start her new café. There's just oneproblem ? the oven she's supposed to use breaks down right before thecontest. Determined to enter, she reaches out to Nick Mazannti (Coco),her old boyfriend from culinary school who gave up his dream of being apastry chef to take over his family's pizzeria. The film is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy. Ilove the fact that this film was logical on how people would react inreal life. Worth Watching
