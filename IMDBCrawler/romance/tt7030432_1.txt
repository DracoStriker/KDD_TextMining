TV Guide this week labeled Lacey Chabert the current holiday champ ofChristmas leading ladies and she doesn't hurt that reputation in thismovie.This movie is filled with the clichés of plot devices. 1) A contest theprotagonist must win to either seed a business or pay debts; 2) Theprotagonist is invited to a special dinner where she expects a ring butdoesn't get it; 3) The lady falls off a ladder into man's arms; 4)Snowball fight (2 in this one); 5) High school sweethearts parted fortheir careers; 6) A kid with an absent mother that one of theprotagonists befriends. And so many more. But wait. The movie laughswith us at some of these. The best example is the aftermath of thefailed special dinner - one potential suitor explains to the other whyKylie was mad when she left the dinner.The story teases us with what we think is predictable, and is to acertain extent, but then slightly twists it. Yes it's Hallmark and yesit is a Hallmark ending, but it is still worth watching.I loved Jonathan Adams as Ralphie. He added so much humor along withsage advice. I criticized Lara Gilchrist is All of My Heart: Inn Love,but I loved her here, again with Chabert, as Kylie's wise sister. Kylieand Nick are almost comical in their sad behavior and they definitelyneed wise heads beside them. I wish I could say I thought Lea Coco hadgreat chemistry with Chabert, but to me it was just slightly aboveaverage.
