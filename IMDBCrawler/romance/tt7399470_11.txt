Mesmerising. A very good romantic flick after a long time . One withoutany vulgarity n unnecessary scenes. One that can be watched withparents too. A lesson maybe for the newbie directors that good moviescan still be made without much of a story line, if u have other factorsgoing. A boy meets a girl, girl is initially not inclined but soon theyare one. Nothing as far as d story goes. But, it's d treatment metedout by d screenplay writer of #dill to pagal hai#, that seals it all.Star of the show is the chemistry that the leads share, that sense ofadorability n innocence they portray, not to take away any credit fromtheir acting. Irfan is definitely a very good actor, n with his wittylines n comic timing is a perfect but annoying suitor . Miss parvathy ,winner of many Filmfare awards in south, is a revelation. She justbreezes through her part. She may b a bit chubby but is such abeautiful actress, so restrained but ready to unleash herself . Hersubtle smile n sweet acting is in perfect antagonism to the swag noutspoken Irfan. They both have been provided some charismaticsituations n great dialogue s to keep d movie engaging. Only a littledose of music meaning a quick ending keeps d ship afloat unlike that ofrecently released #harry meets sejal# bombarding us with unnecessarycontrived scenarios n over dosage of songs.. Though I must admit ,ending could have been better done. Highly recommended for anyonewishing to seek a good time pass road trip.
