Film's idea was fresh, even the casting but execution is unbearablyslow. Film starts dipping after 15 minutes of beginning and finallysinks. Supposed to be a love story, has only one beautiful emotionalscene which is, when male lead sleeps while conversing with female leadover intercom, leaving his night lamp on, which disturbs her sleep. Shesneaks into male lead room to switch off light and notices that malelead is sleeping while holding hand set under his cheek. She tries topull out hand set so he can sleep well which leads her palm stuck underhis cheek. This is OK scene but witnessing film graph it was best onewith tender moments. This scene is followed by most irritating scene ofunnecessary quarrel between both for by mistake tripping by male leadinto female lead room. A lady agrees to go with an almost stranger maleto meet his ex-girlfriends, then male comes into her roomunintentionally. He apologizes throughout the scene but she made itissue because it has to be interval point. Film travels to three citiesbut pace gradually comes to stand still. Two fantastic performers arewasted completely. Irrffan Khan is perfect. Parvathy as Jaya is firstrate. She showcased her caliber in a pre climax scene, when she wasleft alone in a coffee shop and she emotes mixture of confusion,realization then tears roll down her cheek in a single mid shot.
