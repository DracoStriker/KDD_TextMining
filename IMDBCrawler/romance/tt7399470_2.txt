If you are like me and are wondering if director Tanuja Chandra isreally into superstitious nonsense for adding an extra "L" in "Single"in the title then let me calm you down by saying that it's a validreference to the primary theme of the film. Other than being a honestyet dry attempt at mimicking the wildly popular Hollywood hitfranchise, the "Before series" by Richard Linklater, Qarib QaribSinglle is a surprisingly pleasant drama to watch. There is a lot ofconversation going on here, which keeps you hooked, not because of theactivity itself, but because of the nature of the conversation. Youinstantly connect with the protagonist, played slightly vigorously byParvathy. Irrfan's effortless comedy is actually funny that even atight-nosed Parvathy is not able to ignore in this film that talksabout desolation, life adventures, and relationships that happen bychance. There is a lot going on here, some of which are way tooexplosive and heavy for the humorous plot. Neha Dhupia adds to theroughness in the second half but if you look at what the message thefilm tries to convey, it can be easily ignored. Just don't get boredduring the second half and the lady who wrote Dil To Pagal Hai (1997)will make you feel good about life and will teach you to dread a lifelived in suppression. There's an awkward try at creating the forth wallin Qarib Qarib Singlle, which albeit amateurish, is one more goodreason to try the film out. TN.
