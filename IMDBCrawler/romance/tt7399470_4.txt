A widowed Jaya (Parvathy) meets Yogi (Irrfan) through one of thosedating apps. The two characters are completely opposite to each otherwhich make the story line very predictable however, it is thedialogues, especially the one liners from Irrfan Khan that not onlyprevents the film from becoming boring but also leaves you laughing andsmiling throughout. The chemistry between the lead characters isbelievable, thanks to their fine performances that they have masteredall through the years. Summing up, with Qarib Qarib Singlle, Irrfan Khan gives a memorablecharacter and Parvathy, a relatable. The film is a fun ride and aheart-warming romantic comedy that you wouldn't mind watching more thanonce. Rating 7/10
