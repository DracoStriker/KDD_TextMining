My mother really enjoyed this film and urged me to watch it. My highschool friend is an assistant director of this film. Irrfan Khan isplaying the lead in this film. Those were my reasons to watch themovie. But the movie pleasantly surprised me beyond my expectations!The sentiments and the comic timing is so wonderfully written in thescreenplay. And though there isn't chemistry between the lead pair, thejodi of Jaya and Yogi feels real and kept me engrossed throughout themovie regarding the fate of the jodi. Most amazing thing about thisfilm: Jaya looking into the camera and speaking her dialogues. It looksjuvenile in the beginning but when the reason is revealed as to why shedoes it, I was deeply impressed! Overall a fun and emotional journeyabout moving on in life. Now that I think about it, "qarib qaribsingle" is a brilliantly chosen title for this movie. :)
