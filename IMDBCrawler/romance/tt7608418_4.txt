An amazing movie made as a Neflix Original. Extremely family friendlywith a great story....WOW!!! Some may think it too traditional, but tohave a movie made without the usual sexual innuendos and offensivelanguage is very rare in today's society. The scenery and story lineare very well done. All of the actors and actresses were superb.Hopefully, there are others in the works...good job Netflix.
