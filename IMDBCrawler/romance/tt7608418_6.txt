This movie was such a pleasure to watch! Have you seen any Hallmarkmovie? I was expecting something like that, and even though it is thesame type of movie, at the same time it wasn't at all! (But I do think they used the same location as one of theroyal/Christmas movies)The story was great. There were a few twist that were predictable butthere were even more that were unexpected! So no complaining about theplot. The characters were great. Rose McIver never disappoints me. Andthe rest of the cast did a good job as well.There was some kind of chemistry between the main characters. And therewere a few unrealistic moments, but the rest of the story and elementsof the movie were great. Thank you Netflix!If you enjoy romantic movies and you have access to the movie youshould definitely watch it, it's perfect for the holidays.
