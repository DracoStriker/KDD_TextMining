A great ensemble cast. Superb direction. An amazing mystery. The finestof the Christie film versions. Finney is the most amazing screen Poirotsince the great Charles Laughton. He's devilish as much as he is clever andcunning. Beautifully crafted and scripted, the film is one of the finest ofthe genre. Not to be missed.
