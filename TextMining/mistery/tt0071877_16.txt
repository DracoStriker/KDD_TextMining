Despite it was filmed almost 40 years ago, Murder on the Orient Expressstill is great - even if you've read the book. Finney, I have to admit,isn't the best Poirot, but he acts well enough. And the rest of thecast is wonderful! Lauren Bacall is the best, I think: she manages tobe an excellent actress twice, to play the part of Linda Arden whoplays the part of Mrs Hubbard! When Linda's identity is revealed, youcan almost see her turning into a totally different person!The humor of the book is kept in the movie. Pity that Monsieur Bouc'sconstant suspicions about the Italian are cut out, but instead we havehim changing his opinion after every interrogation. Yet Mrs Hubbard'shilarious character is very much the same. And the questioning ofCountess Andrenyi is accompanied by continuous looks of devotedwatchfulness and almost grotesque jealousy of the Count. There arecountless other details (such as Princess Dragomiroff's doggies) thatgive the movie some lightness a mystery always needs.And, last but not least, the film's very touching. It's actually theonly film besides Titanic and Hamlet that always brings me to tears.Ingrid Bergman gives a perfect performance of the gentle, soft-heartedSwedish lady, who is hesitant even to strike the brutal murderer. Andby the end of the film there also is a very moving scene with the calmofficial Pierre Michel crying over his dead daughter's picture - thatwas the director's brilliant addition that allowed us to furtherunderstand the struggles and suffering of the characters.Again, it's a truly ageless movie and you won't regret watching it.
