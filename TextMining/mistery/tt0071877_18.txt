BEST ACTING PERFORMANCE: Ingrid Bergman in an interesting role for her.Pure acting, not a caricature as are many of the performances in thismovie. Gives her "mousy" role some edginess by adding fervent religiousundertones.MOST BELIEVABLE AND NATURAL: Jean-Pierre Cassel. Don't know him butwould search out other movies he is in.MOST NOTICEABLE: Sean Connery (Honorable mention: Vanessa Redgrave).MOST DISAPPOINTING: Albert Finney. Appears to be working far too hard,to the point of straining. I think his speaking style is too bombasticfor this role. An actor can say "he killed five people" multiple timesand get the point across without shrieking the line. I didn't reallynotice his acting because he only looked like someone trying to be ahigh-powered actor, rather than actually being one.PERFECTLY CAST: Anthony Perkins.MISCAST: Martin Balsam (looks like a very American, New York stageactor who has been inserted into this European role for some reasonknown only to the producers.) Lavishly produced, beautiful to look at, well-paced. To its everlastingcredit (thank you Mr.Lumet) this movie manages to deliver an aura ofexciting train travel. Nostalgic, somewhat corny 1930's-tribute musicalscore.Very strong plot- almost too strong for movies but good for a book.Makes you nostalgic for the 1930's but not necessarily for the 1970'sor 1970's movie-making.
