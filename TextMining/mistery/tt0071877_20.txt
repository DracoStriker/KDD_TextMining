Particular praise must go to Richard Rodney Bennett for his compellingmusical score.  He and his colleagues have produced one of the mosteffective opening sequences in my memory.  Over the opening credits (as Irecall), as the Orient Express begins to creep out of the station, the musicaccompanies it, slowly accelerating as the camera captures the huge chuggingwheels, the steam escaping at billowing intervals.  The growing power of thelocomotive, with its wonderful musical accompaniment, creates just thefrisson of excitement one would feel at the start of a grand adventure onthe world's most fabled railroad.  A magical opening to afilm.
