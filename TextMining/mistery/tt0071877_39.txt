I enjoyed this when it first came out-having now seen it again I musttake myself to task! It has all the superficiality of movies historicalof the 1970's---and it's money came from its star power. But pooraccents from the non Europeans and Finney combined with, as has beenpointed out, his absurd 'constipated' look and nonstop barking andharsh throaty voice makes this hard to finish-particularly the last 20minutes. Have you ever been able to listen to someone shout for anyperiod of time? Strange choice Finney-but at this time he was tryingmany different roles on stage-and his Hamlet and Macbeth were similarlyafflicted with vocal worries and brusk and "busy" movement.Stylish and fairly true to the story-but in the end rather a bore.Thenew 'movie, from 2010 with Suchet is far too obsessed with dark andcold and 'what IS justice" --so that it makes Poirot seem small mindedand angry---and its limited budget shows. Yet he is a wonderfulPoirot-the best so far-and- outside of the homophobic who misread hisfeyness---it is somewhat more watchable than this despite its foolishadditions and too severe Poriot portrait......
