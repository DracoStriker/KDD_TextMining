One of my top 10 favorite movies. i always like Detective Poirot seriesand this movie is one of the best and maybe most complicated ones(number of suspects and misleading parts). Poirot happens to be on atrain which a mafia member is on it and almost whole cabin have plannedto be on that train same night to murder him. Along the movie whenPoirot interviewing suspects and you can enjoy his funny acts andtalks, a non criminal story happening, introducing western countriesnations from Agatha Christie point of view. We got American, Swedish,German, Russian, Hungarian, French, Italian, Greek, Scottish, ... whichis quite entertaining and a great job (you be agreed with writer ornot, you still we give her many points). Me myself, enjoyed the underlayer nations behavior more than confusing criminal case, not thatafter ending conclusion i still find it difficult to understand, butnumber of suspects and that actually are were involved almost equally,was quite different compare with other same category movies. Beside themurder case and different nations behavior, at the end, you got to makea moral decision, to agree with Poirot to call the case closed as thevictim was indeed a brutal murderer or leave the case to police (Yugoslavian) or as you can say "to the law".
