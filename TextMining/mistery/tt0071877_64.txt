This film has an all star cast with the likes of Sean Connery andIngrid Bergman in small roles. The film however belong to AlbertFinney, who gives an inspired performance as Hercule Poirot, AgathaChristie's master detective. The film has an impressive beginning as wesee a crime being plotted aboard the exotic Orient Express. The bulk ofthe film however has a more conventional narrative, with Poirotquestioning all the suspects one by one. Bergman is pretty good but herperformance wasn't Oscar worthy. The mystery itself isn't particularlycomplicated, but the film remains watchable.Overall 7/10
