Who's the killer? . Poirot is helped by a ¨Watson-alike¨(Martin Balsam) and they will track down to culprit at the end .At the beginning of the film talks about a kidnapping and killing ababy similarly to the Lindberg's son and which the murderer wascondemned to death row , this one will be related with the death of thetrain.The motion picture is only set on two scenarios : the station and train. However this doesn't make boring it.The runtime movie is overlong : two hours and some but isn'tslow-moving and is amount amusing for suspense and tension.First-rate interpretation specially from Albert Finney and IngridBergman , Oscar winner as best secondary actress .The set design and costumes are riveting , the flick is magnificentlyset by that time . Evocative musical score by Richard Rodney Bennett .Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography is atmospheric and colorful.Sidney Lumet's direction is fascinating such as ¨12 angry men¨ .The movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and thriller lovers.Rating: 7,5/10 . Very good
