What can you say about a movie that has a brilliant whodunit plot, awonderful cast, excellent dialogue, and a memorable score.  This filmshouldhave won more Oscars then it did.  That was the only think i didn't agreewith.  Although it is hard to disagree with anything that Ingrid Bergmandoes, I think that Lauren Becall had a better role.
