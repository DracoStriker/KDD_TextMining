As the first rhytms of the music started the furs on my back stood up itwasso fantastic. But when I saw Albert Finney -the little funny man- theywentdown. The whole film was full of the créme of the actors and actresses butPoirot was the "black sheep'. At first sight he is funny but five minuteslater he is very irritating. Lauren Bacall plays fantastically theAmericanlady with her memoires about her second husband and Ingrid Bergman alsothesame charming with her part of the Swedish missionary with the littlebrownbabies. Michael York and Sean Connery didn't give so much to the moviehistory and I can say the same about John Gielgud. The film was made veryprecisely because the Hungarian passport was a real passport and when thecouple entered the train Pierre talked to them Hungarian. It was reallygoodto hear. The ending of the film was a bit teatrical but at all it wasreally-really good. If you didn't see it, watch it!
