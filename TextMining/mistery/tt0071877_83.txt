First of all, Albert Finney gives a remarkable performance as Poirot : helooks exactly like the character described by Agatha Christie, so similartowhat I had in mind ! I found him so much closer to the character than DavidSuchet, who turns it into a gay-like idiot with a very bad belgian accent.The rest of the cast (with enough big names!) works pretty well, I lovedLauren Bacall as a drama queen lady. Anthony Perkins plays with no problemthe troubled, nervous secretary and John Gielgud is superb as the dignifiedwaiter with his dead-pan humour. As for Jean-Pierre Cassel he is equallyconvincing.I admire the way this movie was adapted from such a book, given thetheatrical aspect of the plot and their characters. It is a challenge totake an Agatha Christie story and make it successful on screen. This filmlives up to my expectations, though you cannot beat the book as often thecase !
