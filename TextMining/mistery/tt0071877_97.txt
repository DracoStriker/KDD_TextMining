The classiest film version of an Agatha Christie novel as well as areal rarity --- a whodunit you can watch again and again knowing fullwell who did it. Directed by Sidney Lumet with stunning cinematographyby Geoffrey Unsworth, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is the grandentertainment films like Daisy Miller and The Great Gatsby promised tobe but weren't. The title tells you the plot and Albert Finney, heavilymadeup, is great as Hercule Poirot. He was Oscar-nominated and deservedit. Co-star Ingrid Bergman won for her performance as an idiotmissionary. It's open to debate whether or not she deserved it. Made atthe height of the "all-star" disaster movie cycle, Lumet assembles acast of TRUE all-stars: Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Vanessa Redgrave,Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Michael York, etc. Gratefully, there'snot a Charlton Heston, George Kennedy or Robert Vaughn in the largecast!
