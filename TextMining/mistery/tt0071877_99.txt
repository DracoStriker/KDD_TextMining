In a decade usually associated with chaotic cinematic upheaval anddrastic change and experimentation, films such as Murder on the OrientExpress, based on Agatha Christie's legendary mystery novel, provedthat the classics could still be in style. Indeed, acclaimed directorSidney Lumet's film would have appeared less out of place if made inthe 1940s than the 70s, but as such functions as a charming, elegantand impeccably constructed throwback to the classic, lesssensationalist mysteries of old - in many ways, the definitive"whodunit". However, those expecting a more action packed, suspenseful thriller mayfind themselves rather sorely disappointed, as, for however engagingand engrossing the intricate series of interrogations attempting todecipher those accountable for the murder is, there is no real palpablesense of threat, of danger to the protagonist as in other such murdermysteries. But rather than a criticism, it is a tribute to Lumet'scinematic mastery that he can remain faithful to Christie's text ratherthan bending it to meet sub-par Hollywood conventions (Finney's Poirotin a fight scene would be hilariously ill-advised) and not compromisethe cinematic scope of the picture in the slightest. This is aninvestigation of conjecture, not action, an intellectually stimulatingtalk-piece which would seem more fodder for a stage play were it notfor Lumet's ingenious technical work. Caging in the action, making theintimate train setting appear all the more ominously claustrophobic andkeeping his subtle cameras constantly moving (an opening sequenceshowing a kidnapping in progress, shot in jittery, dreamlike fades andsweeping cameras is simply superb), Lumet keeps the viewerunconsciously but consistently unnerved and on edge, making theinvestigation all the more gripping and enthralling. The joy of the film lies in the breathless attempt to follow the trainof thought of the brilliant Poirot, and while the tension may besacrificed through his rapid-fire matter of fact deductions, one wouldbe hard pressed to find intrigue this intoxicatingly thick andcompelling elsewhere to such a degree. And with such elegantly styledperiod costumes and sets (the Orient Express itself is a masterpiece ofcinematic potential: masked in superbly artistic shots of billowingsteam and chugging pistons, it shows a clear influence on almost anygiven train sequence since) the film makes its mark as one of the mostsumptuously aesthetic pictures of the decade, perfectly backed by thesweeping and eerie musical score.While adjusting to Albert Finney's flamboyant accent does take time, heproves an unconventionally perfect fit for the eccentric but brilliantdetective Poirot, showing the good sense to play the quirkiness of thecharacter straight rather than overdoing it for comedy's sake andletting his fiery passion for knowledge and reason shine through enoughto win over even the least interested audience member. The rest of theall star cast similarly do not disappoint, with standout performancesfrom Martin Balsam as the warmly charismatic owner of the train, LaurenBacall as a motor-mouthed passenger, Oscar winner Ingrid Bergman givinga nervously passionate performance as an obsessive missionary, aperfectly cast Sean Connery as a gruff Colonel, John Gielgud as a wrylyhumorous butler, Anthony Perkins as an oddball secretary and WendyHiller as a dignified elderly princess, all of whom may or may not knowmore about the murder than it would immediately appear.Of course the film is not for everyone, and may in fact alienate manymodern audiences who have grown accustomed to associating the murdermystery genre with white-knuckled tension and palpable threat, or thosebereft of the patience to sit through the dialogue heavy plot(particularly Poirot's near half hour final monologue). Similarly, itcannot be denied that in many parts the film appears self-indulgent andsomewhat pretentious, caught up in giving each member of the all- starcast a chance to shine. However, criticisms aside, Murder on the OrientExpress is a wonderful reminder of the sort of films that simply do notgrace cinemas anymore, generating engrossing excitement simply throughits intricate plotting and vibrant performances and managing to make amurder mystery with next to no sense of threat fascinating simply dueto sharing the protagonist's passion for solving the case. For thosewilling to side-step the occasional self-indulgence, this ismasterfully constructed and tremendously gripping cinema easily worthexperiencing and inevitably appreciating -8/10
