For as long as I could remember this website was a beacon of lightguiding me throughout a vast ocean of bad movies, actors and directors.Tonight, i feel disappointed. This picture was SO AWFUL I don't knoweven where to begin. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE that it has 8.0+ score? Gal Gadot is beautiful, sexy and physically looks like Diana Prince,but she's not an actress. Well, at least not for a character with thisdepth. I actually felt sorry for Chris Pine, which is the onlysalvageable thing in this 2h20min disaster. The movie has zero continuity, it's so bad written it makes you wonderhow these guys ever got into a position to have had the chance to writesomething like this. It seems as an 11 year old could have written iton the car ride before school.I don't want even get started on the details, because everything majoron this was wrong. From now on, I'm not sure how I'll trust IMDb again.
