Okay, Wonder Woman is now a huge success and not only that but the newfront of the DCEU. The action is spectacular, the fighting is nice butwhat this movie fails in is the loopholes of the plot. Ares was castdown by Zeus and the Amazonians were isolated into a tropical paradiseyet we are not clearly given a connection between the two incidents asto why. Then, we get a lousy plot about how Wonder Woman leaves of toLondon just because she thinks Ares is the reason for the war. Diana'smother confides with someone else to not tell Diana that she is a godkiller, but this is said when she leaves so what's the point? Thenstarts a typical war story where the heroes win a battle, then againsee innocents die because of a man's mistake and the man sacrificinghimself so the other's can live. Okay I get that they were trying tomake him a hero but come on, this is it? The plot stinks... so manytypical plot points are used uselessly to bring out a stubborn biopicof a god, at least the scenes are interconnected but other than thatits useless. It's not BvS bad but it's near Fantastic Four bad...Definitely another DC movie to evade, not different from Suicide Squadwhen it comes to clichés..
