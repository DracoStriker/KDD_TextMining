First of all, this movie only made money because it's a superheromovie. Everyone likes superheroes and there is no way a parent is notgoing to take their children to see it. Look at Transformers. Most ofthe movies are downright idiotic but it still makes money becauseit's.....Transformers. So all popular comic book hero movies will makemoney period. I can't make sense of the movie and I really don't think the writersknew either. Her morales flip flop, the bad guy has no real reason tobe "bad", the good guy has no real reason to "die." The side charactersreally didn't serve much of a purpose.Some parts of the movie are decent and a few seconds later, the samescene turn into a total crapfest. The 3rd part is an utter mess andthat act alone should be more then enough reason to keep WW off the topof the charts but somehow has a 94% rating on RT? That right thereshows you that ratings are padded because you can't have at least 1/3of a movie be total trash, 1/3 of the movie just corny dialog andsomehow end up at the top of the charts.
