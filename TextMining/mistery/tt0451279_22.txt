So I decided to go and see the movie because 8.1 is such a good rate inIMDb. And seriously, what could be better than a hot girl withsuperpowers killing Nazis. However when I was seeing it I felt that itjust was another superhero's movie with nothing to offer more than thesame poor structure of the majority of bad superhero's movies: a halfnaive hero finding her path to kill an evil character that is theresponsible of all the bad stuff happening in the world. In the meantime, the hero decides to believe in clichés like "find love" and"everything is about what you believe" and while she win the knowledgeof those clichés, by very poor reasoning by the way, she increases herpower to kill the evil character. So it was an extremely predictablemovie that we all have seen 80 times but with a hot girl in it.Besides, the rules of the game were never clear, for example: at theend of the movie she decides to forgive the life of a German personbecause it was the right thing to do and she was so just and good, butduring all the movie she was killing people, so one never understandswhere were the line between the good and the bad, the only thing thathelps you to understand the line between the good and the evil was thatin one side you had giggling English men and in the other side you hadenraged Nazis. And on top of that, the characterization of Ares duringthe movie is just painful, they put it like a demon that believes thathumanity is substantially bad and that they should kill each other forthat, but Ares is the god of war and it also means understanding honor,courage and the beauty of the fight, which is very far from the Nazi'shorrors. If Ares didn't exist, the Wonder Woman couldn't exist eitherbecause she is a character built on the vigor of war. I give it a fewstars because the build up of the beginning was actually cool and kindof funny.
