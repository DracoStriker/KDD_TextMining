I disagree with the hype. Spoilers WARNING...The script was pedestrian;the pace was scattered (too fast in the beginning, and too slow whenputting the team together); the logic was heavily flawed (one night ona small sailboat in the middle of the ocean with no indication of wherethey were and you're in London the next morning? One person/Dianasingle- handedly suppresses a whole front line of gunfire with hershield and wrist-cuffs? A German sniper repeatedly missing multiplenon-moving and completely exposed targets? Steve's team of mostlynon-soldiers barging through a German camp without much resistance? Aspy able to just blow up a whole camp by himself in broad daylight onthe fly without being discrete?); wasted/under-explored story lines(Dr. Poison under-explored; Steve's friend, who's supposedly a deadlysniper, unable to shoot, huh?); the motivations/rationale for some ofthe characters' decisions were a stretch, if not unconvincing (WonderWoman's mom initially not permitting WW to be trained in combat,especially when we found later in the movie that WW is the God Killer?Steve insisting on going after the German general while armistice wasbeing negotiated? Team just decides to continue fighting withoutfurther pay after initially clamoring for money while nothing happensin the process that shows they're moved by something other thanmoney?); unexplained parts that the audience is simply expected toaccept (power of the wrist cuffs was never explained; Dr. Poison losesher notebook, but all of a sudden, just conveniently finds a scrap ofpaper that turned on the light bulb for her; Steve's conversation withDr. Poison at the gala about seeing her experiment didn't make muchsense at all). There are more other issues with this film, but thereare more than enough listed above already. All in all, I saw way toomany flaws in this film to agree with any of the hype.
