Although one can find some hints of "fighting for/because of god" (thewriting language in the stolen notebook gives a hint of what god is theanalogy to), this is mainly a boring movie.I am from Israel, and I like Gal (even voted for her as the woman ofthe year for some men magazine), but the acting is terrible, and thevisual/sound effects are far from special.The high score is definitely misleading.
