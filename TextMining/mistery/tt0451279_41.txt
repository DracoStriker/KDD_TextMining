Let me start out by saying I have never been a huge fan of superheromovies. From time to time I will discover one that I actually doappreciate, and after hearing from my friends about this movie.. Ithought this might be one of them. From the plot dragging on to thecharacters not contributing to the story, it goes without saying I didnot appreciate this film. The actress who plays Diana seems to meunlikable as she does not develop throughout the story and seems to betoo strong headed to do anything but what she wants to do. Chris Pine,however, plays a character who actually seems to develop and become abetter person. The special effects were very obvious and seemed cheesy.I found myself constantly checking my watch to see how much longer thismeaningless plot would go on. Needless to say I am not sure why thismovie got such great ratings.
