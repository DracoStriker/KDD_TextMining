I don't know if the problem was the directing or the script but there'ssomething missing from this work. I don't understand the good criticsit received and i assure you i'm not saying this because i'm a cynicalbastard who just wants to give a bad critic. What i think is that somewhere in the process of filmmaking the actingwas damaged and great actors like David Thewlis and Ewen Bremmercouldn't make up for it. Some scenes from Gal Galdot were very Ackwardlike the part where she's talking to Ares and she says "I compel you totell me the truth" (see what i mean?) and i think the main problem washer interaction with CGI. She probably wasn't coached properly tointeract with those moments and i don't know why the director didn'tnoticed that.Then there was this feeling that many moments didn't cohere properlywith each other (The town and then the gala and then the destroyed townand then the military base) and that other moments were forced into thestory. (The beautiful singing of Ewen, The fight between Gal and Chrisand then his magical appearance in the middle of a military basewithout any sign of opposition from the many soldiers there, etc)Veredict: I don't think that is the worst super hero movie i've seenbut it's definitely not one of the good ones. I also think that many ofthe film issues have to do with the directing and the script and due tothose facts the performances of the actors were also damaged. DC pleasewake up.
