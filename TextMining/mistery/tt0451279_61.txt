For most people that go to the movies these days, they tend to keep aopen mind to the tune of simple things; What will the movie bring? howwill the director incorporate certain elements from comics to "reallife" situations? etc etc For me, Wonder Woman turned out to be one ofthose movies. Something that comics (DC in this case) expressed incomic books and now have adapted to the big screen (minus the 60'stelevision series and previous adaptations).Wonder Woman tends to be more action packed at times while carrying tothe original idea on how Wonder Woman came to be. Some crude humor madeits way into the movie early on then hits you with a dose of sequencesfull of action and explosions.For me it was worth watching but I'll probably wait till DC studioscomes out with Justice League sometime soon.
