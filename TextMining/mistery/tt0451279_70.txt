This movie had a great idea that was horribly developed, same problemwith other movies from DC Comics.Characters with no purpose and badly developed, you never even get tounderstand some of these characters by the end of the movie. To manyholes in the plot, a lot of things just don't make sense. Even the"romance" in the movie just seemed rushed and forced.I think DC Comics needs to start focusing on elaborating their storiesand characters, they give too much thought to special effects (onlygood thing about this movie), so the plot ends up being a confusing,inaccurate, cheesy, ridiculous mess.I am actually surprised that Patty Jenkins directed this, I love TheKilling and Monster (both masterpieces), but this movie has somedisappointing directing.
