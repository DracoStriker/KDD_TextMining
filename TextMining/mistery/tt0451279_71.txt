Let me be clear. I am not a Marvel fanboy nor am I a DC fanboy. I loveboth equally. In 2008, I remember going to go see the Dark Knight andIron Man and I loved them both. It is possible to like DC AND Marvel.Now, on with the review. Wonder Woman, the movie with as many expectations to live up to as BvS.It had to prove that you can make a good female-lead superhero movie, agood World War 1 movie, revive the DCEU, inform the audience aboutWonder Woman and her powers, and much more. But overall, this moviesucceeded. For the first two acts, this was a fantastic film! The ole "show, don'ttell" technique was used well in this movie. Instead of telling theaudience, "Wonder Woman can do this and that", it showed off her powersand abilities. As she was learning what she could do, the audience waslearning along with her.However, just like the three previous DCEU films, this movie ended inan absolute mess of CGI. The casting of Ares was awful and notintimidating. If the movie ended right after Diana killed Ludendorff,and she looked around and saw that one man was not responsible for allof the evil in the world, it would have been a top-notch film. But...as it turned out, one man was responsible, so then she had to fight himwhile he screamed things like, "I MUST DESTROY YOU!!!!!" It would have been nice if it had ended as I described, but you can'tbe perfect.
