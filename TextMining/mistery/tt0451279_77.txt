I pretty sure they paid to get high score, that is very oblivious, atthe time movie was on the marketing stages you can see all those goodreviews, but since the marketing is over, you can see all is poorscores which in my opinion are from real people. I guess IMDb thinkabout sort of way to don't let movies marketing teams cheat on gettingthe scores.
