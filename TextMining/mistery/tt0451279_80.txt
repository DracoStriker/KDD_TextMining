One word: awful. The over-acting and weak story line made it incrediblypainful to watch. The worst part was the CGI; it might have beeninteresting a decade ago, but the Iron Mans, Avengers, Wolverines andBatmans of the world have raised the bar too much so very disappointingon this front. I really wanted to like this, but gals hotness doesn'tmake up for all the shortfalls.. unfortunate
