One year and 7 months since BvS, the Trinity is back with additionalmembers. A half-man half-robot guy, a man who can talk to fish, and aman who can only push something when he is running. First, let's talk about each member character's development except theTrinity. First is Aquaman. Because of his role is somehow important inthis movie, he's got a lot of background story. Can't explain morebecause there is a spoiler on it. Next is Cyborg. He has similarportion with the man who uses fork to fight. However, he has asignificant role for the movie. Last is Barry Allen. The movie bringspremise to Flash movie in the next year. Overall, it is great.Move to the plot. Personally, I do find it fast-paced :( Maybe it istrue that Zack Snyder is lack on delivering the story. Up until now, itbothers me why Warner Bros used this kind of plot to bring the league.Nevertheless, I was delightful to see the action scenes. The first lastbattle makes me shivers.Conclusion's time! Justice League is a nice-packed of several actionscenes movie. I would say that this movie is a jumping stone for theirnext crossover because of its lack essence of the story. For fanboys,there are lot of hints that you can find in the movie. It pleases yourthirst, I mean hunger, for comic book references. The score is 8 of 10.(If it is seen by the action, I would definitely give it 9)' P.S : There are two post end credit scenes. To be honest, the lastcredit scene almost make me lost my mind on DC Cinematic Universe.Totally love it.
