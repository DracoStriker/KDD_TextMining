Hey, don't go with high expectations, the movie is far away from epic,but it's pretty fine and funny, I enjoyed a lot of stuff, thecharacters are awesome! Even Steppenwolf isn't the lame they said, heis just not memorable, he's OK, a generic villain who delivers whateveryone should expect (come on, it's Steppenwolf, why would you guysexpect a mind blower villain here?) The plot is simple and works. Theonly fatal flaw for a huge fan of DC is the return of Superman, damn,that's was sooo weird :/ And Zimmer would be so much better than Dannywas, buuut there's nothing we can do about it now, at least it'snostalgic.
