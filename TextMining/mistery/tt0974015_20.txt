Let me start off by saying -- I'm a huge DC fan and a movie buff. Ifully appreciate the intricacies involved in bringing something thishuge to the screen and I realize there are weaknesses in every movie.That being said ?It's as if the writers have attempted to cram the entire DC universeinto two hours with little consideration for what that does to the plotor the viewer's brain as they try to comprehend this hot mess. On topof that, The villain is the most generic brand of threat-to-the-planetbad guy imaginable and it takes way more energy than I have to take himseriously enough to even care.But that's's okay right? When the writing is bad we can always keep theaudience entertained by blowing things up, you know, like in Superman -Man of Steel (in fact, just like in Superman - Man of Steel) whereSuperman and General Zod knock down all the skyscrapers in Metropolis.Over and over. Pointlessly. For seemingly the last hour of the movie. But we'll need some really exceptional CGI to make that band-aid hold.Which leads to ? who releases a movie in 2017 with original Star Warsera CG? I And even that might have worked had they not overreached byso much. And the music? Not so important to the overall movie, butreally? What did they do with that massive budget? Maybe they should have paidthe actors and actresses a little less and a bit more for the writers,composers and the CGIShort on plot, same old tired action scenes but now with antique CGI,uneven acting (not that there's really much room in this movie foranything resembling acting ? ridiculous posing at best) and it onlytook $300,000,000 to lay another DC egg. How does the same company thatis capable of the Dark Knight and Wonder Woman come up with this ...crap?Should come with a warning -- Move along, there's nothing to see here(beyond what you've already seen for free on the trailer).
