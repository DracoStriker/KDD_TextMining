I really enjoyed this movie although there are a few things thatdefinitely stood out that holds JL back from being well-rounded.1. Pacing/Transitions. One thing I enjoyed about WW was the fact thatit flowed a lot better in my opinion compared to BvS (theatrical cut).The beginning of JL was choppy and from what I understand they had tomake the movie less than 2 hours via the WB CEO. You definitely seethat in the pacing which the movie honestly needed about 15-20 moreminutes to smooth things out. 2. Villain. Steppenwolf overall was a pretty good villain but couldhave been more. One thing that disappoints me about any superhero movieare villains that aren't fully utilized to their potential. Those are the two things that stood out to me the most about JL thatleft me wanting more of a better product.On the other hand, the character development is really good. I enjoyedFlash, Cyborg, Aquaman. Ezra Miller is a great Barry Allen. Ray Fisher& Jason Mamoa fit their characters really well. WW, Batman, andSuperman were all great but it was nice to see JL uplift the newsuperheroes & pave their way for their future solo movies, etc.The movie was really fun, jokes were there and most of them were welltimed. The overall tone was light-hearted than BvS, but I personallyliked BvS being a darker tone.There are two end credit scenes! Be sure to stay!!! I believe the waythat JL ended it opens up a realm of possibilities for DC. I am excitedabout the future and what DC does with their characters. I know they're5 movies in right now but they're learning from their mistakes for themost part. This franchise has a bright future as long as they continueto not make the same common mistakes that plagued a lot of their othermovies.8.5/10.
