The movie is really messy and embarrassing. The villain's CGI is sohorrible that you feel like you are watching some form of cartoon.There are some good moments within the movie. Especially Superman'sinteraction with Flash and rest of the team initially was prettyamazing. We kind of see Superman like we have not seen him before. Ireally loved that part, it was extremely hilarious at the same time.There was really good tension during those scenes. Flash is superamazing. But that was kind of the only good part of the movie. Almost everything else is just crap. The final showdown fight, if youhave seen the trailers you have seen most of the best parts. There isso many plot holes within the movie, its amazing how anybody allowedthis version of the movie to get released.But I feel its kind of waste of time, to go to the cinemas and watchthis. Better to watch once the DVD comes out.
