It's been just 20 minutes since I left the movie theater and I'm stilltrembling in happiness. First of all I'm a die hard Superman fan. Whatan awesome movie it was! I was expecting the return of Superman but Iwasn't expecting this. I of course read some theories around how hewill return and on who's side he will fight. This outcome pretty muchcovers it all. I almost left in tears when Suprman engages Steppenwolfand I was shocked how well crafted that moment with classical Supermantheme. Overall the story is very good. The movie and the charactershave good sense of humor. You feel like you get to know the charactersmore and discover their new sides. New additions to the team Aquaman,Flash and Cyborg have a very good introduction before their own moviescoming up. Characters like Batman, Superman and Wonderwoman prove thatthey have much to offer in upcoming years. Just like Marvel Universeand Avengers I think we will get to see more team ups even in solomovies in the future. This is first in line and with more movies ofother DC characters I think there will be more addition to the JusticeLeague in the future. At the very of end of the movie Bruce Wayne andDiana pretty much have a conversation around the same topic. There ofcourse some weaknesses but I can't wait to see the longer Blye Rayversion of this movie. I'm very satisfied overall and I will watch thismovie again.
