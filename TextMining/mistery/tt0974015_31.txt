A few key elements are missing...- Proper cinematography: The direction here was just God awful.- Good lighting: Looks like film students did the lighting. No one knewwhere it should go, how to measure it, or how to grade it after theCGI's been added.- A different Wonder Woman: She simply doesn't fit the tough but cuterole. I really thought they would've swapped her out by now. That otheramazonian extra in the 2 sec shot however could've done a better job.- Mature cast: Just Ben here. He really is completely solo on this one.The rest of the team was delivering generic broadcast level 8pm qualityacting.- Less CGI: Literally every scene. every scene, and the colors wereoff, it might as well had been a video game.- Sound director: Who choose that intro song ? Who heard the intro andsaid this was a good idea, and who watched the whole thing and thoughtto publish it with that song still there?- and can someone tell me why Danny Elfman was chosen to compose theOST ? We all know he had a good run, but times have changed. It allsounds like action-movie-in-a-can, no hooks, no frills.- Decent scripts: "if this is a gift, then why am I paying for it" -again, this whole thing is a television show, with TV actors, and TVscripts, with TV lighting and TV CGI. It was at that line, I walkedout. A dreadful 30mins in. Honestly, I'm surprised I lasted as long asI did.
