First things first, it is a better film that B v Superman. But it isobvious that when writer Josh Weldon (former Marvel director forAvengers) took over directing from Zack Synder the movie changed. Youcan literally see when this happens in the film. It starts off like aSynder DC movie, all dark and trying too hard to take itself way tooseriously, then half way through the characters start joking with eachother and the movie injects some relief. But its disjointed at best.The problem with DC universe on film is Zack and the control he has.Marvel is brilliant because they have oversight and provides a bigpicture platform, but they let aspiring directors (lots of them) takesome risk and the result is unique fun films. This movie proves DCfilms will never be on par with Marvel films. Wonder Woman was great,but that was obviously a fluke. The other problem is they just mashedthese characters together without time to get to know them. Not worthyour hard earned money to see this film. Wait to see it free on anairline, you'll thank me for it.
