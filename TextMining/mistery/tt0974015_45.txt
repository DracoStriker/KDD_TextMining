November 16, 2017 It's a dreadful ride i was extremely disappointed,horrible CGI, the villain is the weak link, he has no personality, ihad no idea what his motive was. The tone itself is just horrible,gloomy, too dark, and painful to sit through. They tried to mix marvelsformula into the mix, did not work ! The film was very rushed! It'slike they just cramped a whole bunch of heroes together and said " savethe world ".
