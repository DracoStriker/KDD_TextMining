justice league had every chance to improve and make a good film at thispoint people seem to have such little faith in the film some came outof it surprised and said it was pretty good now before i get into thisfilm one thing you should know about me is that i'm not a causal moviefan i consider myself a critic and a tough one at that i see somethings most causal audiences don't see but just because i am like thatdoesn't mean my criticism of the film is invaded. i went into this filmwith a fresh mind i had no expectations what so ever people would tellme that it was fun and pretty good but going out off it i was reallydisappointed with the film the acting felt really wooden it seemed likeeveryone had a miserable time and it shows in the performances the plotof the film is non existent through out the film i couldn't understandor follow what would happen and in this film no one changed and no onegrow as a person in the film and the main villain just reminded me of aforgettable marvel villain the tone felt really off too i guess withthe response of batman v superman the studio panic ad turned it intothis a happy goofy tone which doesn't work for dc what the studiofailed to understand was the reason batman v superman failed becauseoff the fact that the reason of conflict was stupid dc do make greatdark story's but this film felt like it was just trying to rip offmarvel another thing i dislike is the fact that in the film characterswill have information that they should not know what so ever whichmakes the film all the more aggressively bad also the one another thingi noticed was that in this universe they are all supposed to feelconnected but this film feels like it belongs somewhere else but notthe DCEU the only thing i kind of liked was the flash i mean he doeshave some bad dialog but i feel if the writers had fixed some of themistakes they made with him he would have worked a lot better but as ishe is the only character i kind of cared for but that's all i can saythat is good about this film. i will end with this there were somesources saying the first cut was unwatchable and if this film is aawful mess i can't imagine what the first cut of this film is like itwas a shame how bad justice league was i genuinely hoped this filmwould be fun but it wasn't at all i guess you could say for me thisfilm is the death of the superhero genre for me it representseverything wrong with the genre as a whole because the more i noticethe more i see the superhero genre being boring predictable productsbut that's just my thoughts on justice league if you think this ratingis unfair and you enjoy this film all i have to say is enjoy it all youwant after all it's just my review of justice league
