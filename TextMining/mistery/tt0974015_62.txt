Don't listen to the critics, just watch the movie and be entertained.Definitely better than Thor Ragnarog.The movie starts with beautiful cinematography, great shots, and veryentertaining dialogue.Batman is no longer an angry character with a gloomy mood, Wonder Womanis still the same with the previous movie, while all other charactersexcept for the Cyborg, also very funny.Definitely better than Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice. I dare to sayit's actually the best DC movie in a long time. I could watch thismovie maybe 100 times more before I get bored.Truly an entertaining and enjoyable movie to watch. Make sure to waituntil the end. There's an exciting surprise in the end.
