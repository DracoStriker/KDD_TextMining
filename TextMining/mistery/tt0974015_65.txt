This is a direct sequel to BVS and was clearly supposed to be directcontinuation of that story and style. Editing is a mess, especially inthe first act. The entire film seems to be cobbled together by cuttingdown a very serious 3 1/2 hour epic movie into a brisk 2 hour ride.Clunky "cute-funny" dialogue and scenes that don't fit with the rest ofthis "epic" film Some CGI blunders: see S-man upper lip and weirdpurple rootsHalf of the footage from the trailers didn't make the final cut (notnecessarily a bad thing but I find it distracting at points)
