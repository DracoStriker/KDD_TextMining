justice league animated series was my favourite. and justice leagueflash point paradox is my favorite superhero movie after the darkknight. but this zack snyder movie was not good at all. .. 1.Alfred-"they said you would come, i hope its not too late" me and myfriend had a bet, who is Alfred is talking too, superman or GL, butguess what ? They never showed this scene. . 2. i was hoping for greenlantern cameo or something epic. but only suspense in movie wassuperman's return, which is obvious. . 3. darkseid? they never showedhim. . 4. The villain? after general zord then doomsday what we got injustice league? weakest villain ever, superman didn't took a punch fromhim, while doomsday was able to beat him. . 5. If superman is morepowerful than ww, aquaman and cyborg combined and also as fast as flashthen why you need a team? . 6. the ending? opening was good, middlepart was better but ending? superman just came and beat the hell out ofvillain and paradeamons were like krybots of power ranger(completelyuseless) . 7. Batman's dream in bvs? I thought they will show here-"listen to me, lois is the key" what happened to that segment? . sooverall i am disappointed, they reduced showtime to just 110 minutes,didn't showed many scenes which were in trailer itself. .so stopfooling yourself.my all 4 friend were angry at me, due to this movie.We need something better from DC than a strait laced movie.
