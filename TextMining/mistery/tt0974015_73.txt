I grew up with DC and JLA (and Superfriends). Gal Gadot is perfect andWB got Wonder Woman 'right'. But she can't save this film. it's justdull. If you are going to spend your money, go spend it on ThorRagnarok - it's visually more impressive and has an actual plot thatyou can invest yourself in; Justice League's plot doesn't have anyhooks to latch onto, and while we love the characters, and the cast hasfinally been well thought out, with the exception of Wonder Woman thecostumes are still a failure and the story is all over the map makinglittle sense and not allowing for any emotional investment in anycharacter other than Superman - whose roll has nothing to do with thethreat at hand or the history of it. Go see Thor.
