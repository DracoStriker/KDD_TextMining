An entirely forgettable affair in every sense of the word, JusticeLeague fails to setup any further direction to the DC world-buildingthan a slow descend back to camp where it was after Tim Burton's Batmanmovies 25 years ago. Nolan's years at helm are certainly far away bynow.The bafflingly conventional, illogical and randomly jumping storydoesn't have a single unexpected turn of events and instead treadswaters that have been trod many times before and with greater success.The CGI is strangely haphazard, with very little care how it stands outwhen scenes are edited together. Steppenwolf is an eye-wateringly badvillain, becoming a clumsy scarecrow whose motivations and powers comeand go.Actors are an uneven bunch, both as characters and as talents, and failto generate camaraderie or chemistry. Ezra Miller is so much better asan actor than the rest that he becomes a distraction by reminding usabout it constantly. Every time his delivery elevates the poormaterial, it turns against the movie when the next one who opens hismouth only looks cringe-worthy.
