I have so high expectations of this episode I was looking forward towatching it in Cinema and specially in IMAX however I was really sodisappointed the plot is not an excellent Everything is predicted thestory doesn't have so many surprises It's so much like other herostories where there is a bad guy who wants to destroy the world andthen some good heroes just unite to fight it!! no twists no surprisesno fun nothing new Didn't add anything I think this would be my lasttime to watch DC movies in the cinema May be at home on my laptop wouldbe much betterStill it's not the worst movie .It's just not as much as what wasexpected by me through what I've seen in the trailers during the wholeyear What I think is that if there's much better movies it would better towatch these other movies , if not and you want go to cinema you can gowatch that movie but don't expect too much!!Thanks
