I'm a big DC fan and have been since i was young. Bringing all theheroes to the big screen has been something I've been waiting to happenfor a long time. I believe they nailed it! there was so many referencesto whole DC universe and at times there was the joke, which doesn'thurt. Every other person who is bashing movies like this is either notinto superhero films or just don't like DC. The film had its slow partsbut that's where the story needs to originate from and tell theaudience whats actually happening, the fight scenes were spectacularand yes there was C.G.I but what superhero action movies don't have itthese days. I loved the story and am enjoying the base that DC havestarted to build on, people will love it some people wont but if youlike superhero movies with a good cast it wont let you down.
