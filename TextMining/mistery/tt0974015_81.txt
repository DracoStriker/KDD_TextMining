As someone who really loved Dawn of Justice, Justice League is not avisual experience that was Dawn of Justice. This is lighter much morekid friendly version. Zack Snyder is visual style can be clearly feltin most scenes but it doesn't feel like a Snyder film through andthrough. As we have already seen Batfleck and Gal Gadot in previousfilms, the stage was set Jason,Ezra and Ray. Contrary to what thecritics said, I didn't feel that Cyborg sucked. He was able tocommunicate his predicament well enough in initial portions and wentfull Cyborg later. Jason Momoa being the badass was exciting and thelasso revealing the truth was funny. Ezra Miller as the rookie whoneeded friends has great comic timing and brought a laugh in manyscenes. The Trinity of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman continued fromwhere they left. Batman getting served with his own line was one of thebest moments in the whole film. There were many good dialogues from allthe characters including references and possible easter eggs. The oneliners didn't feel forced either. The score gelled well with what wason the screen. But editing left lot to be desired. Overall the moviewas real fun while it lasted. It could have really used more run time.Audience were left wanting for more. There were a lot of scenes thatfans would drool over. Many scenes that were shown in the varioustrailers were not part of the theatrical cut. I feel like we now have adefinitive answer on who is The Strongest Member of the League and letthe debate begin on who the fastest is.
