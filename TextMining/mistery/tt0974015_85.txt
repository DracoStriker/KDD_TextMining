I've just watched the Justice League movie this afternoon and I totallyenjoyed it! It's amazing out of my expectation because I was influencedby bad reviews from some sites like Rotten Tomatoes. Now I know theywere wrong! The only thing I have to complain is that I wish the moviecould be longer. ( I would give the movie 9.5/10 on IMDb but 9.5doesn't exist so I chose 10) I love the superheroes, great chemistrybetween them! I love Batman and Wonder Woman so much! The Flash is verycute but it's not true that he steals the show. Actually, all 6 heroessteal the show! All of them are very attractive and lively! I don'tknow what the others think but today all of the audience in the cinemawas satisfied and applauded excitedly. Now I'm still excited and I knowI will watch it at least two more times. From now on, I know I willnever trust the critics again. We must watch it ourselves because wepay for the tickets, not the critics
