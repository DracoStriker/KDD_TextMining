Let's start with the characters. From best to worst IMO, Batman; BenAffleck was great. He played both Batman and Bruce Wayne near-perfectly. Aquaman; The only one with a brain. He was probably thefunniest, and I am so happy they didn't use the Orange and Green suit.Wonder Woman; Pretty much the same performance as in her solo movie,and that's good. Flash; Funny at times, cringey when not. Cyborg; Heenunciates well. Jeremy Irons is also good as Alfred.I'd put him in themiddle. The Plot;This is the worst part of the movie. It starts by aggressively flingingyou around the World, introducing everyone. Something about Box,characters, Box, characters. Speaking of those boxes, the villainSteppenwolf, is horrible. He has no motivation other than 'I destroystuff'. Oh, and get this... Superman comes back. I'll bet you had NOIDEA that was gonna happen. He forgets who he is, Wonder Woman tries toget him to 'Remember who you are, Simba' Lois comes in to make himremember, and the have some romantic banter, probably written by GeorgeLucas. 'You smell good' 'I didn't before?'. The third act comes on andthey fight Steppenwolf, and ironically, dies the same way as JeremyIron's Character in Lion King. Eaten by his minions. That's the movie.It seems like a short summary, but despite the movie being 2 hours, itfeels like 3. Oh, and if you want to do a twist, don't list HenryCavill SECOND IN THE OPENING CREDITS.
