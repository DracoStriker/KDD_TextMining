1. Affleck once again proves HE IS BATMAN.2. Plays out like a Justice League episode.If you've ever watched a DC animated series like Young Justice orJustice League, then this will be something to enjoy. If you haven'tseen those, check them out. They are amazing.3. The only complaint I have is that Danny Elfmans score was soforgettable in comparison to the previous two films. Although it wasfunny to hear the old Batman and Superman scores integrated. I justthink they were going somewhere new with the past few scores and did acomplete 180 OK this.I left happier than I've been since Batman v Superman (also amazing)came out. Thank you Zack Snyder and the rest of you guys. Please keepthem coming!!!
