Absolutely horrible,boring movie.It doesn't come close to either thefirst movie,which was excellent,and the second,which was good.Now,weare supposed to believe the creeper is some sort of Mcguyver whosetruck is booby trapped beyond belief,deflects bullets,has run flattires,and dispenses rolling explosive devices who turn on command andare able to follow vehicles.The creeper is indestructible,andsupposedly has psychic abilities able to have his weapons return to himon command.The story was non existent and explained nothing.If you areall for non stop kills with no story whatsoever,this is for you.I knownow why it wasn't released at the theaters.And if you are a fan of GinaPhilips,she made only a 1 minute appearance at the end of the movie.
