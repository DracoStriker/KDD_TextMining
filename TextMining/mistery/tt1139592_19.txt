Jeepers Creepers 3 is a weird movie going experience. I loved the firstone, and really liked the second one. I went into three wanting to loveit. I didn't. But here is the weird part. The movie felt like it wasnever fully finished. Almost like a very rough first draft was thefinished product. It almost looked as if they ran out of money beforeit was completed. It was very strange. If you are a fan of the firsttwo, you will like to see the characters you love. If this is yourfirst experience with the characters, you will be like what the helldid I just watch!
