This movie was a big let down. Its obvious that the director must havenot had enough of a budget to make a good cgi movie, and the story wasall over the place. The Creeper scenes look like they were filmed in ajunior high school project from 1992. I could hardly tell what I waslooking at in some scenes as they were so dark, that it may have filmedunder improper lighting. This actors are very green and some of themlooked like they were just hired for being young. The stories are in noway tied to the original films. There is no answers provided for theCreepers origins (and not even a hint in trying to do so....). I waited14 years for this?? After all the drama about this director, you wouldhave thought he would have put more direction in is writing and atleast gave a clear story to follow). The main character Adison is justrunning around being chased by the Creeper and her potential loveinterest. Neither of which are compelling or seem to be believable.This whole movie needs to be thrown in the trash where it belongs. Ihaven't been so excited for a film in a long time, to be totallydisappointed in this amateurish attempt. It looked like it was made forYouTube. I had to keep asking myself if this was real, and why theywould have even made such a terrible movie. How do you go from 2 greatfilms to this?? I was excited to see the 4th film before seeing thistrash, but now I think I will just avoid it and act like this movienever even existed. Victor, you really let your fans down with this. Goback write a REAL story that tells us what the Creeper is, what makeshim him, and what his origin is. Quit with the jump scares, its playedout from 1989 and on! Go back to the Creeper in the night time and forgod sake's give him so level of mystery in the scenes. It was like Iput on the Creeper mask and ran around a high school movie set with myfriends. EMBARRASSMENT!
