Why?! JC1 is probably one of my favourite horror films of all time. JC2was OK - probably made better as it was shot quite well. So JC3!!! So excited when i heard it was being remade, it felt like anage before i saw the posters that it was being released. So the credits roll - wait, is this a TV Movie? Give it ten mins, surely the acting will get better - Gina Phillips will be back in itsoon and we will have a good storyline and decent acting. Gina? Gina???? nope, no Gina, ah there you are for ten seconds!Stereotypical characters fill the movie, the creeper suddenly has aninspector gadget style truck - the old school fearful monster scareshave been replaced by a truck that has been made by Macauley caulkingcirca 1993. Oh and one thing that is very strange. It us shot in DAYLIGHT! the cinematography is terrible also, the music is right from thehallmark channel. Yeah, disappointed and also angry that a movie franchise that so manypeople love has been ruined by this 90 minutes of absolute dross.
