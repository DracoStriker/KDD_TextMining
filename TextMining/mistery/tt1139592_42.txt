Watched it at the one day only release on Sept 26th. A really funaddition to series, more in the lines of Part 2 rather than the darkand scary tone of Part 1. One of the first positives that come to mindare the production values and the cinematography. Some of the cameraangles are pretty awesome. Very hard to review this without givingthings away. Another positive is some(attempt at) character developmentsimilar to Part 1. More screen time for creeper than probably bothmovies put together, which is awesome. Not every thing is rosythough...acting, especially that of the lead actress was wooden atbest. Some claims which Salva made about the movie were not true, whichwas a huge disappointment for me. To summarize, don't miss it at anycost if you are a JC fan. Oh and there is a surprise cameo as well :)
