This movie was pretty bad, I had previously had it on pre order fromAmazon but decided to watch it on the syfy channel to see if it wasworth the twenty dollars. It starts off well, the plot is interesting,and there are cool things for the movie to work with such as thecreepers origin, his weird truck and how it now seems to be alive.Instead of using messing these things into an enjoyable story it wentdown hill pretty fast.
