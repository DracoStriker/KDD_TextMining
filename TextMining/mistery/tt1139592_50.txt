I don't even know what to say really. I waited the 15 years for thislike everybody else and it was garbage. The whole movie was just people giving each other weird awkward looks.The scenes dragged on for far too long which was really annoying. Not much creeper time, action or killing and when there was it wasincredibly lame. Like the creeper having magic abilities that justautomatically make weapons show up in his hands.The beatngu truck, also had stupid magical abilities. The creeper no longer had his personalty nor did any other characters.What really pisses me off is that they dug up his hand and itapparently has magical abilities that lets who ever touched it, knowit's secrets and what is and crap. So a bunch of people touch it andall they find out is that it gets to eat every 23 years. WE ALREADY KNEW THAT !!! From the first film even !So we find out nothing about it. The film literally had no ending atall. Acting sucks, no story or plot. Characters sucked. Special effectssucked. Everything sucked. By the 3rd quarter of the film I didn't know if I was supposed to belaughing, like is it a drama/comedy ?Also all the bad words and who knows what else is edited out. Prettymuch no night scenes. All broad daylight. And what is with the vampire skull hanging in the beatngu truck ? Whywas that never explained ?15 years for a stupid syfy TV movie. This is just sad.
