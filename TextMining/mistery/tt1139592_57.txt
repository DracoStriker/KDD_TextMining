The film opens letting us know the creature feeds once every 23 yearsfor 23 days and it isn't 23 years after the first one so this takesplace as a sequel to the first one and not the second one. Thechronology is as messed up as something George Lucas would do and notnearly as entertaining.The characters act as we already know them and we don't. Gina Phillipscomes back for what amounts as nothing more than a cameo to set up afor a fourth film. The story didn't have any real surprises and thedialogue lacked zip. Addison Brandon (Gabrielle Haugh) one of theprotagonists set up as "the final girl" was on the pathetic side,moping around, oh woe is me and my crazy grandmother (Meg Foster.)so-so sequel. Should have been better.
