I guess I'm not as hard on this film as other reviewers, because Iwasn't expecting much.The second Jeepers Creepers was awful beyond description, so, unlessthis movie had been shot by a bunch of twelve year olds, with actors noone's ever heard of, there was really no way it could have out-awfuledthe second one. This film needed editing on a school level. There were so many plotholes and the tie ins were tenuous, at best. I'm still confused if the kid at the end who got on the bus wassupposed to tie in to part 2...where was he in part 2 and why didn'tany of the kids know what was going on...as he would, because he'd justlived through an encounter with The Creeper?Jonathan Breck, once again, puts on a stellar performance as TheCreeper. No one could possibly pull off a better job. But what was with the red shirt? Stan Shaw put in an excellent performance and Brandon Smith's greatperformance will probably go mostly unnoticed too.Worth a watch...just don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed.Just watch it for the opportunity to see the Creeper, once again, dowhat he does best.
