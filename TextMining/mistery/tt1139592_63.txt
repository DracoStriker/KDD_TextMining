I have been waiting for this movie for a long time and when it'sfinally here it has ruined all the excitement that was there before.The first 15 minutes of the movie are more than enough to give you ahint to not waste your time on this complete piece of garbage. Althoughi still watched the movie hoping that maybe it will get better whichnever happened. It just got bad and bad and bad. There's nothing good about the movie and i literally mean nothing.First there's no plot, they even managed to mess up a straightforwardstory line. Second, the events happening in the movie made no sensewhatsoever. It simply looked like they were trying to combine variousrandom events. Third, the acting of the characters is very bad. Givenwhat was happening in the movie, it had some of the most bullshitdialogues and expressions i have ever seen. Fourth, the representationof the creature in this movie is the worst in the series. Since, whendid it needs all those weapons, it's like all of a sudden it has becomemodern. Simply took away the originality of the creature. The leastthey could have done is to give us some closure about the origins ofthe creature but again that never happens.So my advise to you is to just stay away from this. Only see it if youare interested in seeing a movie that's a contender for one of theworst movies of the year or maybe of all times.
