As a fan of the Jeepers Creepers franchise I have anticipated therelease of this movie for quite some time now. It suffices to say thatI was very disappointed at the final result. I'm not going to sugarcoatit; the acting was pretty bad. It ranged from "poorly acted" toblatantly over-acted. That alone made the movie borderline unwatchable.But the icing on the cake were the cheap VFX. I've seen some pretty badCGI and this movie had some of the worst. The bomb balls and theexplosions were laughable. I literally laughed out loud when I sawthem. Not even a child would be fooled by such video effects. Evenstorytelling-wise the movie disappoints. I was expecting some sort ofcontinuity between the second movie and this one. Hint: there was none.I still love the prequels, I'm just going to pretend that this moviedoesn't exist.
