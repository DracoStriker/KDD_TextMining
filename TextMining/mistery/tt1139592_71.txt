If you struggle with insomnia, watch this movie, you will fall to sleepfast. It is utter cheese, poor acting sand a poor story. I liked thefirst Jeepers Creepers, the second was OK, this is horrendous. It's notlike my expectations were high or I was desperately waiting for thismovie, it was just plain and simple $hit. Don't waste your time.
