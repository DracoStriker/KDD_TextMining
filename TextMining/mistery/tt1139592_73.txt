I'll be brief: Bad acting, bad cgi, bad acting, lame over the topweaponry, and bad acting. Characters yelling at each other is nosubstitute for a story. It was so bad I didn't even finish watching it.Not even the type of bad that is accidentally funny, just bad. Thefirst movie was good, the second was OK, and this one is junk. Saveyour time and skip it.
