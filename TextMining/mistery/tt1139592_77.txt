The story takes place between #1 and #2, and starts up right after #1,so the premise seems promising! But this is one mother of a waste oftime! BEATNGU, the creeper's vehicle has a bunch of new magic powersand is the main "bad guy" of this tale. And the makers of this filmreally Sharknadoed it, meaning the special effects are terrible andcompletely fake looking. The only scary thing is Meg Foster'sappearance. Don't waste your time - just watch the first 5 minutes andthen the last 5 minutes, and you'll see all that you "need" to see.
