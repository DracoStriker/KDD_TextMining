I waited 14 years for this? Complete garbage.Shot mostly duringdaylight hours with some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. CGI is on parwith most movies shown on SYFY.This dumpster fire will air on SYFY onNovember 18th and that's exactly where it belongs,with the othergarbage.The creeper deserved better than this!
