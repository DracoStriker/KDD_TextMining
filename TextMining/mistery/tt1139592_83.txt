I watched this out of boredom and it didn't ease my boredom. But, itwas entertaining none to less. I do have some issues.The creatures red shirt. Now i know it symbolized many ill begotten andevil things associated with the creature. I simply found it far todistracting as the shirt itself was the at the center of the creatureand the center focal point. If they wanted to pull off the redsymbolizes evil they could have gone with a much smaller article ofclothing. it was a poor choice.the ending. He gets on the same bus that is attacked. yet, in the moviefollowing this one on the same time line no one on this bud (assumingbuddy is on it) knows whats going on? i mean this is the worstcontinuity plot whole ever and it has ruined a great cheesy horrorseries for me.
