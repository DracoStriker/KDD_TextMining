This movie couldn't get into theaters in any normal way so I had tocatch it at a Fathom event. The experience at the theater wassurprising but also rather annoying as it was packed from some strangeJeepers Creepers fanbase that loved to talk during the quiet parts andlaugh during the horror. The film itself had an interesting enoughstory to entertain for two hours with the benefit of a ton of jumpscares. The Creeper (Jonathan Breck) returns or maybe he never left asthis film picks up directly after the first film. The police surroundthe Creeper's deadly truck full of booby traps. Sgt. Tubbs (BrandonSmith) calls for the truck to be impounded but they don't realize theCreeper will want the truck back. Sheriff Tashtego (Stan Shaw) leads anelite group that hunts the Creeper.The film quality looked terrible and most of the acting was rough. TheCreeper returns to get his truck and kills one of the officerstransporting. On a farm, an old woman Gaylen Brandon (Meg Foster)continues to see her dead son much to the dismay of her granddaughterAddison (Gabrielle Haugh). The women are poor and can't afford to feedthe horse Addison refuses to sell. Gaylen tries to tell Addison toleave the farm because she is warned by her dead son's ghost that theCreeper is coming. Addison goes to buy hay on credit from Buddy Hooks(Chester Rushing) and his father but stops at her friend's house whereher jerk brother Kirk (Ryan Moore) keeps a rabbit trapped in a cage.
