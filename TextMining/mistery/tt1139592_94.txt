Not too impressed with part 3 of the "Jeepers Creepers" movie seriesespecially after making us wait 15 years for a 3rd sequel when we wereready for one way back then when it was still fresh in all of ourminds. I felt a little lost at first also after not seeing the otherfilms for so many years. It just somehow seemed more silly and lessscary than the other two movies. Nothing good enough in it to even makeme want to watch it again. The Creeper was far less mysterious than inthe past films and was just sort of out there all the time killingeverybody compared to the previous movies where he made fewer but farmore memorable and scary appearances . Maybe it was because the lowbudget or just poor writing this time?
