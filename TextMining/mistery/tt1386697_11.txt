Just awful -horrible dialogue, zero premise. Stereotype Squad as far ascharacters concerned...in particular the Asian 'character' which wasobviously a laughably cynical afterthought and the Boomerang Joe orPete (I didn't care) - I mean, come on! Will Smith seemed embarrassedor wincing delivering his lines -hard to tell -and as for Jared Leto'sOTT indulgent 'acting' -sheesh. Margot Robbie was probably only onewhose character had a few good lines. Sad to see the otherwiseincredible actress from Secrets and Lies reduced to the ridiculous bosscharacter. The CGI was awful, particularly the monster at the end.Didn't make me feel anything toward the characters -no emotionalresonance whatsoever.
