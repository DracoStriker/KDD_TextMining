Suicide Squad is a tedious movie. I saw this last night and I've triedto forget it ever since. From the get go, the Suicide Squad anti-heroes are introduced one-by-one. Then, once they're all given their backgrounds and clichédintroductions, they are delivered to their new boss, one . . . by . . .one. This consumes about the first 45 minutes, just before themeaningless action takes place. What's really ironic, More time is spent describing their ironicnatures than explaining their first mission. Consequently, their firstforay just seems pointless, because it is. The character development was weak and I really didn't care if theycame back alive or not.HACK: In a fiction-writing context, the term is used to describewriters who are paid to churn out sensational, lower-quality "pulp"fiction such as "true crime" novels or action centered "super heromovies".Batman Begins (screenplay/director: Christopher Nolan) is a study incharacter development. Suicide Squad (David Ayer writer/director) is ahack job if there ever was one. And yet it has a 6.9 as I write this, so I see shills at work. Timewill water this "dog" to it's real valuation, about 4.7 is my guess. Igave it a 1/10 because it's was insultingly bad. PS - Will Smith is interesting as usual, but not nearly enough torecommend this. This movie is a study in rote-cliché, predictable andplodding screenplay development, and extremely poor dialogue. Dead Poolis SO much better, that is if you want to laugh at super heroes.
