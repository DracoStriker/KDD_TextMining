If you want to enjoy this do not ask logical questions. Of course if Iwanted a documentary movie , but logical inconsistencies here are toomuch...How a camera mounted on boomerang would not flip?How the boomerang wascapable to hover?Why the enchantress didn't took the Amanda Waller's phone and killedthe whole suicide squad?How the El Diablo didn't triggered the explosive when he went fullfire?How the explosive was capable to kill the 'brother' but combination offire, bullets and katana cuts was not? Explosion didn't look sopowerful...Why at her final appearance Amanda Waller had her fingers on the touchscreen of her phone and this didn't kill anyone? Who gave Harley a cellphone? And did't spy her communication at least? This could save fewmarine's life and a helicopter.Why Deadshot,Boomerang,Slipknot,Harley Quinn (and even Katana) wereconsidered as meta humans?Why Amanda took the helicopter as it was the helicopter? There was nohelicopter operational more than 2 minutes , before it was took down.Does the enchantress has two hearts at the end? How nobody recognizedher brother's statue as a dangerous thing? Was his heart hiddensomewhere? And what kind of archaeologist was June? She brook thepotential precious artifact?And she was alone in the jungle?Why Slipknot was not present in the initial intro of the 'metahumans'.He came out of nowhere and died stupidly.How the squad attached so fast to each other? Especially the boomerangwho killed his biddy during the robbery.And even a simple pistol is a superior weapon than this stupidboomerangs.What was the point of captain boomerang , except thehovering boomerang with the camera?And the joker was a joke. Who the hell thought that a joker withouteyebrows will be a good idea. His face is so expressionless without theeyebrows.And these flashbacks were so chaotic....
