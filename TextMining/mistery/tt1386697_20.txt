If you expect this movie to be a great fusion of picaresque andsuperhero genre, you are wrong. This is really a desperate attempt fromWB and DC to revive the dying DCU, so they decided to copy what theythink makes marvel movies such a success. A PG13 lighter atmosphere andadd some comedy. Really? is this what DC thinks people like watchMarvel movies for? Well if they really wanted to be successful like amarvel movie, they should try to make something like Deadpool. Rated R,some blood and anti-hero stuff. As usual DCU completely missed thing that make Marvel movie successful.A good script that makes sense. This is just a movie that introducesless popular DC characters nothing more nothing less. The whole movieis like "This guy is Deadshot he shoots guns! This guy is Killer croc,he is scaly! Here is katana she is for all weeaboos! We have more thanBatman and Superman you know." When all the introduction is done, half of the movies is done. And therest is just rushed plot and really bad PS3 level CG and action to fillup the rest of the time. In the name of bad script, bad CG, bad action.A trinity of fail makes this makes Dawn of Justice look like CitizenKane. And that is no compliment. Such a shame as it had elements thatcould have been an innovative superhero movie. But just like dawn ofjustice, it has been wasted and it will never see the light again.
