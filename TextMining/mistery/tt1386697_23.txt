After sitting in the theater, about 30 minutes into the movie, i askedmyself: "Why the hell did this pile of vomit make it to the big screen?Why did I pay full price for this straight to DVD shoot-em-up fest?,why do I like that deranged blonde so much?". Plot of the movie: Get a bunch of deranged psychotic freaks to team up,shoot a bunch of generic freaks to get another big freak to stand in acorner so the humans blow it up with a generic bomb, that is the wholemovie right there.Congrats to the marketing team behind this movie, getting so muchpeople to watch this garbage is a big accomplishment.I imagine I would have enjoyed this movie if I was drunk as a skunk orhigh as a kite. Waste of time, waste of money, waste of talent, wasteof resources, waste of life.
