Let's be honest ? I'm a big fan of the DC Universe, but Suicide Squadeis a train wreck.The story which involves super natural beings trying to create somekind of super weapon and destroy humanity for not liking them is justplain and simple stupid.David Ayer has managed to single handedly destroy the DC Universe. Ifyou wanted some nice action, look another way. The effects are awfuland the script is just awful.Ben Affleck as Batman is still a hit though. Just pray to god that thisJoker doesn't appear in the new flick.
