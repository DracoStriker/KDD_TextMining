If you go into this movie with low expectations (like Transformers typeexpectations) I feel like it would possible to have a alright time andyou could moderately enjoy the film. The movie is all over the placefrom the beginning and doesn't ever quite hit its stride inestablishing It's identity as a film. The character development wasunconvincingly rushed; in what seemed like no time at all theindependent, villainous, metahumans go from being hellbent on revengeand/or escape to becoming a super positive tight knit "family". Thehumour was very hit and miss as most of the intended funny moments feltawkwardly forced and/or geared towards a yonder audience. There wereoften moments where it seemed they were pushing really hard for alaugh, but instead, it just came across forced opposed to organic. Onthe upside the acting was solid for the most part and the movie boastedan awesome soundtrack throughout. Overall I was pretty disappointedwith Suicide Squad and recommend skipping right over this floppedsummer blockbuster.
