This movie tries to be so much but ends up being a real mess.Where do I begin? Character introduction runs for almost 40 minutes andI still don't end up giving a damn about anyone.Jokes are often very misplaced and feels extremely forced. Many scenesfeels like they were made solely for sake of the trailer and also thetrailer resembles nothing of what the actual movie is like.CGI is so off that I divide the movie into 2 teams, CGI-team and realteam, and I keep ending up thinking how the ***k is human team going tobeat world consuming superman-like characters.However I do like the look of the Villains, especially Enchantress.Maybe this film is the best thing for DC Universe superfans, but forthe casual viewer it's very hard to get a grip of this movie, at leastfor me it was.
