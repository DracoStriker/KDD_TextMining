Total waste of space. Further more, a real insult to the comic fans tosee their well honed characters in such distorted on-screencharacterisations. There has been almost no regard to the sourcematerial. The director is armature at best, clumsy and messy most ofthe time. The only good scene was added by Zack Snyder which stoodheads and shoulders above this mediocre film. Avoid. The cast wasgenerally good, though I thought Will Smith looked and sounded like thefresh prince on a Halloween Night special. I would rate this a FF4 typeof disaster. not something I would pay to see again or even the firsttime if I was so forewarned.
