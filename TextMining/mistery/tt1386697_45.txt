First of all, this is my very first IMDb review, ever. I took to theInternet so that others don't get betrayed like me. Really boring,cringing and disappointing movie I have watched in quite a while. Theonly amazing part about the movie is its trailer, and that's it! All,the characters are kinda forced to group up against some illogical $h!tstorm that was "accidentally" created. The plotting was really poor,even a 7 or 8 grader could come up with something more appealing. Hope,others don't make the mistake I did. The only thing that took methroughout the movie was the hope of some real action as the moviesuggested. People thought Batman vs Superman was bad, well, this onewill sure make you thankful for the BvS.
