After the recut of that movie, the suicide-squad mutated to afamily-fun-film.It could contain some spoilers and nuts...The Joker and his love-addict Harley Quinn? That was raping the comics.And "Deadshot" should be named in this film "Flowerdaddy". What hashappened to the real figures?Its like "ohhh, Frank Millers Batman-Version in 'Superman VS Batman' istoo dark for some douches, so lets recut that one and put somefairyglitter and lovers in it and let the characters play house".But with that, u raped the real Suicide Squad.For me, I hope there will be an original cut, sometime on bluray orDVD.THAT one.... I just want my money back!*Yukk*
