It's clear that this is a blockbuster aim to rake in millions ratherthan a movie with a decent plot, interesting characters with meaningfulrelationships and good acting. Not to mention, it's been done before.Recently we've been given the franchise where superheros work togetherto fight evil forces. Here, it's flipped around and it's not that welldone.After introducing the main evil characters, David Ayer decided it's duetime for action, action and more action. Hence the characters are flat,no one really cares for them or their motives. It's because they happento be so awfully annoying rather than intriguing considering the movieis about them. Take Hannibal Lecter for the antagonist of all time. Hispresence on screen was captivatingly thrilling, he had the audienceglued to the plot at all times. I guess it's not Ayer's fault becausetrying to cram so many characters into just an over two hourblockbuster is difficult for any director. Plus it didn't help that hedidn't develop the storyline which happen to be ridiculously silly andat times confusing. Then there is the dialogue. Every line spoken byWill Smith or Margot Robbie were so cliché and brain numbing. Don'teven get me started on the Aussie aka Jai Courtenay's Boomerang.No doubt there will be a sequel given the success at the box office andalso how chummy the characters became towards the end and with JaredLeto's Joker running loose in Gotham. My bet is that he will be themain villain next time. If you want a movie where big explosions andspecial effects matter more then this is for you. I watched it to seewhat the hype was all about. I was right, it's just hype. The one staris for Viola Davis though - for appearing in this mess and deliveringher lines like a pro even if she may have wondered what the hell wascoming out of her mouth.
