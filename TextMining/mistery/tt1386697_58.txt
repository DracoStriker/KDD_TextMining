I went into the theater ready for a fun and crazy summer blockbuster,however, the only thing this movie got right was the title, because Iwalked out of the theater ready to kill myself. I'll give you the shortversion, because I could go on for hours. Maybe 2 characters in thismovie are useful. The others could have been completely cut out.Horrible editing ruins just about every scene, and re shoots areobvious. Things in this movie just kind of happen, even if they make nosense. The Joker was heavily advertised, and is in the movie for maybefifteen minutes. And he's just too crazy. You can't be the crime kingof a city if you can barely put your clothes on in the morning. Hisbackstory with Harley is way under developed and illogical. Harley alsoturns out to be the most annoying characters I've ever seen. It'sreally hard to explain how bad this movie is without going into detailabout every scene, because literally every scene of this movie is puregarbage. I'm not exaggerating, I'm not being edgy, this is one of theworst movies I have ever scene. Please, don't watch this film.
