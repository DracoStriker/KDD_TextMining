This film is a mess. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was great. And WillSmith brought his A-Game. But almost everything else about the film isboring, lame and OMG WHY DID I PAY MONEY TO WATCH THIS? I could go onbut you heard it all before. So let us talk about the Joker. Fanboysare giving Jared Leto's Joker a pass by saying we didn't see enough ofhim to judge him. Ummm, did they watch the same movie as me? The Jokerhad more lines then Wonder Woman in BvS. We saw him interact withHarley, some thug, Harley a few more times and some other guy. We gotto see Leto's Joker. And spoiler alert, it sucks. Leto's Joker remindedme of those Jokers you see in a fan- made YouTube video. Basically, heis generic as hell. So yeah, this current DC cinematic universe killedoff the Joker. If you fools want to continue pretending like the DCU isanything but below average then you can go right ahead. I gave them 3honest chances. I will not be spending a DIME on anything to come outfrom Warner Bros (DC films or otherwise) until they come to theirsenses and REBOOT THE DCU.
