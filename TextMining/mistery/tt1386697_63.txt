Apart from Jared Leto's turn as The Joker and a few fun moments withRobbie and Leto this comic book entry is flat and somewhat dull despitethe action.The premise: In the wake of Superman's death an Intel Operativeproposes to utilize the skills of some criminals with powers of theirown (ala The Dirty Dozen) against an enchantress and her minions. The introduction of each of the super criminals gives hope that this isgoing to be a fun ride but it never pans out. Much humor is needed butthe little we get is pathetic! This is an example of a project poorlythought out and even more poorly executed.
