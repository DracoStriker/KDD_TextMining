Suicide Squad, although first shown as a gritty movie like itspredecessors, turned out to be a genuinely fun and exciting moviefilled with thrills and occasional spills. The cast had pretty goodchemistry, characters interacted with one another very fluidly andpretty much everything made sense and fit together. Although the storywas a bit predictable and at times stale, it made up with amazingfighting choreography and mind-blowing special effects. And the jokerwas legitimately one of the best jokers I have ever seen, even betterthan jack Nicholson's's portrayal.Overall recommend this movie to fans and casuals alike.
