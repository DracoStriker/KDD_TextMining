Let's be honest, it was just a bad movie. Jared Leto's Joker may havebeen the worst ever. How do you screw this role up? He played the Jokeras some scummy wannabe rapper. Unbelievable stuff. This is the sort ofthing that had to come out of a corporate focus group.Much of the production, action scenes and stunts were terrible anddated. It was like watching a 90's movie. How awful is David Ayer atfilm making? Seriously. It's like going back in time, watching the setsin this film. It looks like one of those old Universal theme park ridesfrom back in the day.But let's get to the one scene that just made me want to walk out. It'swhen Amanda Waller kills the FBI agents in the Tact Ops office. Onereason I hated it is because it's classic David Ayer. He HATESauthority and thinks everyone in power is working for the devil. Lookat all of his movies. There's a theme. Maybe he met one dirty cop inhis life. Who knows? This is how he portrays ANYONE who works for thegovernment, as the right hand of Satan. It's juvenile.Secondly, the reaction of everyone to the massacre was one big joke.Rick Flagg is supposed to be the Boy Scout Special Ops soldier and he'srather "oh well" about it. Will Smith is impressed and thinks it'scool. It's messed up and contradicts the writer's development of thesecharacters. I couldn't take it seriously anymore. I found itunbelievable that Waller could get away with that, nor could I see WHYshe did it, considering the cat was out of the bag about everything,anyways! Also, wouldn't you think, "Hey, maybe she'll do this to mevery soon?"I will never see another film Ayer makes, ever again.
