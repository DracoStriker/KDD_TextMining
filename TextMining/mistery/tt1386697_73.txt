I've given it an 8 but would say its more a 7.5 All in all it was agood entertaining movie.Harley Quinn done her job well of being a love struck psychopath.Joker was a bit here and there for me. A bit too love struck back. Heis suave and has a crazy unpredictable mob boss aura to him which Iliked. No one really knew what kind of response he wants when put in aposition of choice.Will Smith although one of the enjoyable characters in the movie didn'treally feel like a Deadshot to me.They smoothed it all in nicely with the odd jolt here and there.I'm not going to write too much as its early days and there areprobably lots of people waiting to go see it who are skimming throughreviews.
