I've just came out of the cinema!! And I've never felt more upset aftera movie like this 1 I was having huge expectations for this movie andIt's ended up with huge disappointment. The propaganda and fuss totallydon't worth it and totally exaggerated. I don't recommend this moviefor any one! Except if you like to be fooled. this movie is a totalmess. none of the actors stood out! What the heck the movie makers werethinking. the worst movie this summer without any computation and itwill collect many awards for worst movie, actor, screen play....etc. Ihave no clue y it's no.1 in the box office!! I HOPE IT'S NOT A SEQUEL.I'M looking forward to watch a good movie to erase such experience!
