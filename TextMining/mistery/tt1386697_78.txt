Suicide Squad is evil terrible.  It's a glorification of brutal loss ofmorals by all parties, done in depressing dark colors, dirty texturesand non stop ugly brutality. If folks are rating it 75, we are in serious trouble.  I think thestudios are stuffing the comment boxes big time.This movie is not just terrible.  It's evil, it's an evil vision, it'san evil experience, it's just plain evil. I had to come home and watch Age of Ultron to clear my mind and soul. Wow, the contrast was universes apart.  DC is promoting corruption,violence and evil, Marvel, even though it's an action movie with fightsand deaths, is promoting love, caring and peace. The DC universe is dark and evil, so we have to be evil too. Parts ofthe Marvel universe are dark and evil, but not the majority of it. TheMarvel heroes strive to stay good even when facing evil. The best DC universe version was the 2001-2006 Justice League andJustice League Unlimited cartoon series. Batman: the animated series1992-1995 was pretty good too. This whole dirty gritty depressingversion of the the DC universe has been tacked on by movie and TVdirectors, it has nothing to do with the comics, or the cartoons. It'scontaminating some of the marvel TV shows too. I'm sick of it. Itfetishizes evil. Not to mention, lack of color, amorphous cabbage heads for theenchanted soldiers, infantile story and characters, ugly sets, uglycostumes. ugly, ugly ugly.
