The chemistry between the characters are great, as well as thedevelopment between their relationship. in my opinion, one of thestrongest chemistry is Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Their chemistry iselectric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to careabout each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together.even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is RickFlagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, andunnecessary. Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plotis the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under- developed,andat some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it toomuch, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch themovie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI ispretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between thescenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think theycould do better after building up the story of the fight scene.
