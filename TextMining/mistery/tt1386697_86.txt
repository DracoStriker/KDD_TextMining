The third installment in the DCEU proved it's worth (For Dc Fans),beating both its predecessors by miles. I'll start with the Pros of themovie.1.The acting in Suicide Squad was spot on, Will Smith was my highlightperformance of the movie,perfect as Deadshot, managing to capture bothaspects of the character, the hit-man and the Father. Margrot Robbiewas just amazing as Harley Quinn, and i'm really excited about what DCwill do with her if she gets a solo movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Wallerjust steals the show every time she is on screen.2. The story was good, as it really made all members of the squadinteract with each other in so many ways, relating both to theirCriminal lives and their personal ones.3. The Action sequences are very good, especially the ones havingDeadshot in them.Moving on to the Cons:1.The movie was too predictable,when i enter a movie i wanna be curiousabout whats gonna happen later in the movie, but with Suicide Squad ireally didn't find that, as the ending was very predictable.2.Too little screen time for the Joker.I really find it annoying thatthey didn't give much screen time for the Joker, one of the reasons whyi wanted to see this movie was because of the Joker, as i wanted to seeif Jared Letos performance could top or equal that of Heath Ledger'sperformance, but i really couldn't as i wasn't shown enough of him tomake my overall verdict about him.3.Very Weak villain, as you saw in most of the trailers and the largemedia campaign WB gave to this movie, they focus very little about thevillain. The final showdown between the Squad and the bad guy wasn'tthat interesting, as the villain was defeated very easily. Overall Verdict: It's a good movie and is definitely worth your time,it is better by miles than Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. Themovie could have had a better villain, more screen time for the joker,but all in all it is a good movie and i am certain most DC fans willlike it.
