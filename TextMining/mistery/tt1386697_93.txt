There are some spoilers in this but not many and this review is just myopinion. First the the bad the plot is messy and confusing at timesthat had a lot to do with editing, I fairly sure that there well be anextended cut on the DVD which will fill in some of the massive holes inthe plot. Some of the dramatic pauses were unnecessary. The ending ofthe film was just bad and blatantly a set up for the next film. Whatthis movie has got going for it is good characters, good specialeffects and great music and thankfully a 15 not a 12a. There is onemember of the squad and (I think you can guess who that is) who waspointless and was the sacrifice to make a point. Margots performance asHarley Quinn was great, Jay as Diablo was pretty great as well. As forWill and viola his is not as bad as you think he is and she is just asbad as you think she is, I think killer croc and katana were unused,Joel as Rick flag was OK, first time for me seeing Cara acting I thinkshe did a pretty good job more as the enchantress than June moone. Thejoker just out of his tree freaky I think Jared had fun playing therole, Jai a lot of the time in roles misses the mark but in this hereally pulled it off. The action sequences and fight scenes were reallycool. The suicide squad are not really against each other (apart fromkatana) but by the end they consider themselves friends and are evenwelling to help flag go up against his girlfriend because using her aweapon was a bad idea.
