I had high hopes for this movie. In fact, you could say this was one ofthe most anticipated movies of my lifetime. I was psychologicallytormented by Tim Curry at the age of 10, and it took several years toget over the weekly nightmares. Although aspects of the trailers mademe concerned this was going to turn into a jump scare film that youstop taking seriously by the midpoint, the overwhelmingly positivereviews that were coming out after the initial screenings had meoptimistic and excited to be the first one telling everyone to go seeit. Unfortunately, I can't do that after seeing IT.The first 10 minutes of the film were perfect. Ultimately what I wasmost looking forward to from IT was a new take on Pennywise. I wantedto see what a different actor could do with him, particularly hisability to be psychologically creepy and disturbing. And I felt like Igot that in the first scene, and that was pretty much it. After theGeorgie scene it seemed like anything Skarsgård did was masked by CGI,overblown audio, and distracting cinematography in 80-90% of hisremaining screen time. What's sad is I think the mainstream audiencewill still eat this style up. The same people who will call thisPennywise scarier than the last are the people who said the Star Warsprequels were better because they had more LIGHT SABERS in them. OK.Sure, I enjoyed the crude Richie and Eddie humor, and thought it waswell-cast for the most part. But by the end I was almost yawningthrough the Pennywise scenes. I just got out of the film and am alonein a dark basement right now and am not scared in the slightest. Thereis something wrong with that.
