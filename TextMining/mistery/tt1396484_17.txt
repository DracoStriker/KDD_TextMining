*Spoliers*Honestly I was really excited about this movie, like really excited. Iwatched the original IT this morning to get ready for it and have somereference. And it was absolutely terrible. Seriously, TERRIBLE. Notonly did I want to walk out the second Pennywise was shown in thebeginning but the rest was torture. I was with other people so Icouldn't walk out. Here's the thing, this is the first time I've everbeen so disappointed with a movie that I went out of my way to write areview about it. The clown was not scary in the slightest. The teethwere stupid. The acting was a joke. The kids made a ton of terrible andsexual jokes. It didn't stick to the original movie whatsoever. Theytook the "you'll float too" a little too seriously. It just plainsucked. In the original, the kids were innocent and actually dorks butthis was pathetic the way the kids were talking. And why the hell didwe watch them in their underwear?!? I still keep wondering how the hellthis movie is rated above an 8 when it should be a disappointment foranyone who knows what a good movie is. This was so much CGI that ittook away from the whole movie. I could keep going but I think I'vemade my point. I wouldn't waste your time or money. Watch the trailerand that's as good as it gets. Ugh.
