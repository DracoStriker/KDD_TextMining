This has to the best horror movie I've seen in a very long time. Beingcompletely honest, it wasn't as scary as I expected but it was WAYbetter than I expected. Script, story and casting was all perfection.This movie really did the book justice. I am super excited for the nextone to come out. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who may beeven slightly considering going see it.
