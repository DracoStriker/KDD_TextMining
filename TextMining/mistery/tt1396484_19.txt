There just isn't the heart that was there in the mini series. In myopinion. The actors were fine, but the story wasn't there. I believethere is to be a next installment covering the (now) grown ups. I'llprobably watch it - if I've nothing better to do. It's simply notSteven King's "IT'. ALso,they appear to have recycled the CGI lady from' Mama' at one point : can't find it now, but look out for it."Beep,beep, Richie" appears once, so far as I can tell - a long wayinto the film. Against all odds, I looked forward to this. But it'sanother turkey. Steven King tells great stories - why do the Hollywoodmob insist on killing them? I truly think this was dreadful and not apatch on the original. I hope to goodness they don't remake The Stand.'
