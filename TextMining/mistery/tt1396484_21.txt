Even though this movie didn't scare me,it was the first time I heardpeople scream in the audience ever. This movie was absolutelybrilliant. It looked beautiful, the actors did a splendid job and thisadaptation of IT really added something valuable.I do have to say thatthe first half of the movie didn't quite capture me, but then it justgot better and it kept surprising me.
