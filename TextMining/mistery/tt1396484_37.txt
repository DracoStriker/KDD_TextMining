Dare I say it, the cheesy 1990 mini-series is far superior. Despite thehype, this adaptation was a real letdown. The kids were great, howeverthe the CGI was awful and the jump scares were cheap.Bill Skarsgard? Hard to tell between him and the CGI.This adaptation was lacking in both exposition and soul. All we havehere is a CGI clown terrorising some kids. There is no depth to thestory of his origins. There is no proper backstory regarding the kids.There is absolutely none of the feeling of dread that both the book andthe original mini-series encapsulated. No atmosphere whatsoever.Its not a bad film, but highly lacking.
