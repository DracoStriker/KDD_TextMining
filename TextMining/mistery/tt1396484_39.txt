IT is a horror drama film based on the Stephen King novel of the samename. Starring Bill Skarsgård in the title role, the film not onlysucceeds as a terrifying horror film but also as one of the bestadaptations of Stephen King's work to date.In 1989 in the town of Derry, Maine, a group of outcast kids known asthe "Losers Club", are each terrorised by a frightening, shape-shiftingentity they collectively refer to as "IT". When no one else in townwill come to their aide, the kids decide to band together and fightagainst "IT" themselves while also overcoming their own personaldemons.Like with comedy, horror is a highly subjective genre. What one mayfind scary may cause others to roll their eyes in annoyance.Thankfully, IT provides enough scares that seem as realistic aspossible and prevent the film from being silly. This retelling takesitself very seriously and doesn't constantly rely on jump scares forlegitimate horror, instead by building a creepy atmosphere ofuncertainty and individual torment in each of the kids. The cast isfantastic, Bill Skarsgard's performance as IT, in particular that ofhis clown form Pennywise, is terrifying, almost on par with HeathLedger's Joker in The Dark Knight. He definitely feels like more of athreat than Tim Curry's version, whom by today's standards seems alittle too goofy and wacky to be scary. In addition to Pennywise, allof the child actors are brilliant. Not once did I ever feel unconvincedof the fear that they were feeling. Even the usual Stephen King tropesseemed more subdued in this film, aside from the usual setting inMaine, of course. If this is the future for adaptations of StephenKing's work, then I am most certainly on board.I rate it 8.5/10
