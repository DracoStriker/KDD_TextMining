Stephen King's stories are always mysterious and interesting and thisis no exception. I assumed this to be another novel-movie blunder butturns out it is a great movie. The acting is great, the clown is scary(not too much) and there are some fun moments. What more do you need?There were, however, some awkward moments and the story could have beenmore versatile in some places but overall, I think it is great.
