I watched this film in Sheffield on the 13th of September. I had highexpectations for this film - and IT exceeded them.The acting. Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry,and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded meof Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (playedby Finn Wolfhard) was my favorite and his jokes cracked the wholecinema up. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is scary and really creeped meout, but for me there was just something missing about his characterand I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms withthe development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaptionfrom a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it was a great film that kept me on the edge of my seat, withstrong performances
