I think the film was good, but didn't really live up to expectations. Ididn't find it that scary. Admittedly, one of the jump scares worked onme but otherwise I never felt any dread looming in the pit of mystomach. The film is gorier than the mini series. That's for sure. AndI liked that updated aspect, but nothing particularly shocked me. Therewas quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good. And Ithink that's a big reason why I just wasn't very scared.The other dumb thing I want to mention is that sometimes the charactersfell into predictable horror movie tropes. Its just kind of silly whenthey've already been scared by Pennywise many times. Knows this all"isn't real" and yet will wander off by one of the missing kids going"Come here". I mean, really? You're going to fall for that? I thinkwhat does save this film are the performances. Bill does a good jobwith Pennywise. However, he does lack the charm that Tim Curry had. Butthose were always going to be big shoes to fill. (Clown pun notintended). The kids though were amazing. In particular Jaeden Lieberher(who played Bill) and Sophia Lillis (who played Bev) were thestandouts. I also want to give a shoutout to Nicholas Hamilton (whoplayed Henry) for managing to make me feel empathy for a bully. FinnWolfhard (from Stranger Things) plays Richie who is meant to be thejokester of the group. And Finn does well with that character. I justwish the writers had laid off from the jokes some of the times. You'resupposed to be building tension and it kind of gets ruined when heopens his mouth to make a joke about period blood or whatever.I see the potential in this film. And I think it could have been reallygood. I just think they spent too much focus on "shock value" ratherthan building on an atmosphere.
