I went into this movie expecting a darker horror movie about a kidkilling clown. What I got was more a very uneven and strange film. Amovie that transitions from dick jokes into creepy sexual dad/daughtervibes back into dick jokes then into a CGI ridden Pennywise scene.Making the movie come across uneven and messy in my opinion. It's as ifthey could not decide if they wanted a light hearted child drivenadventure tale like "The Goonies" or a dark child driven horror filmlike "The Girl Next Door". What the viewer gets is something in themiddle that kind of had me leaving the theater saying "meh". As ahorror fan and just a general fan of all movies I will not be returningto re-watch or recommend this movie. Also a side note the kids cleaningup a blood soaked bathroom only they can see in a lighthearted musicalmontage scene almost made me pack it in early, absolutely horrendous.I'm giving the movie a 6/10 because it has some laugh out loud momentsand kept me entertained through out. Sadly it's not very scary but someof the Pennywise scenes are still a fun time.
