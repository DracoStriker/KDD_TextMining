Most of the movie is disjointed "scary" visions every character has tohave. It's like there's 4 different scenes, but EVERY character has tohave them. "This is what I'm scared of", "this is me getting bullied","these are some "scary" scenes", "this is me standing up to someone".And then they hit the poor clown with baseball bats and steel rods forhalf an hour. It was was just boring.Pennywise wasn't godawful. That's as much as I will compliment him. TimCurry was better.Also, holy **** can someone fire the sound editor? EVERY TIME somethingeven mildly paranormal or supposedly scary was happening some moronkept banging a piano, or blowing a trumpet, or whatever instrument madethose noises. Can I have a moment to enjoy the creepiness or getunnerved by something first? Damn!I have no nostalgia attached to the miniseries, but it was better.
