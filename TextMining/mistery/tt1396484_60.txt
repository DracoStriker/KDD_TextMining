The new it movie was visually well made. The script and story was meh.The scariness as meh. The whole movie was meh. I would have like to have had a lil more back story on the clown. Theclown's big scary move was to just be sped up... sorta like daffy duck.Not scary in the least. The only people who may find this scary are thepeople who are afraid of clowns in general. The clown gave all histricks in the opening scene. Save your money for the Annabelle movie which was pretty good.Generous 5/10
