The film's a tremendous disappointment--especially given the hype. "It"is chaotic and unfocused. Mind you, there are some moments that featuretruly spectacular visuals, and the film wants to have heart, but it'snever scary and the narrative is--at best --picaresque. What's themystery of Pennywise? The movie doesn't care. Why is Ben being soughtout for special attention by town bully Henry Bowers? Forget about it.As a result, there's no real sense of drama, and some of the adultcharacters are so terribly stereotypical that any scene with a grown-upin it is difficult to watch. I'm crushed. i really hoped that this filmwould do for horror what Avengers did for Superheroes. That is, I hopedit would signal the start of something really epic. Instead, it feltlike flipping through a bunch of movie channels on Oct 31. Sure, yousee some scary images, but you just can't seem to care that much aboutthem.
