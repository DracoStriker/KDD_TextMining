What a disappointment - with such a high rating here I expected so muchmore.While the director got the best from the wonderful children here itfelt like this was the first attempt of a 12 year old to show what fearis - utterly disappointing and totally unimaginative when it came tothe horror aspects.This is a trash adaptation of a wonderful novel - go watch paint dryfor more entertainment
