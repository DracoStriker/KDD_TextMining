(I'll be playing fast and loose with spoilers here)I generally enjoyed this movie but there were a whole lot of really oddthings that irked me. Characters in this movie generally make gooddecisions, something you don't often see in horror movies, so it feltreally odd when one character was assaulted with a knife and they don'ttake him to hospital or even tell the police; they just steal somecotton balls and... patch him up? Another point, I know in Americanmovies the bullies are always cartoonishly evil but come on, they carveletters into some kids chest with a switchblade. That's an actualcrime. But heck, perhaps it's just set in the most anomalously amoraltown in the world, because the adults are all evil too. From the rapistdad, to the insulting librarian, to the 50-somthing pharmacist flirtingwith a 15 year old. I wouldn't mind but the movie explains none ofthis, it spends the whole time talking about something that happenedlong ago, and alluding to a curse and goes nowhere because (surprisesurprise) this is IT: Chapter One, of however many chapters will stopmaking money i guess. With all this said, i didn't actually hate the movie. As child actorsgo, they got some good ones (the main 2 or 3 especially); and thecreature is fantastic. Some of the vfx were a bit unconvincing but mostof the effects were great, i loved pennywise who was brilliantly actedand choreographed, and the score was really brilliant.Unfortunately i didn't find it scary; mostly relying on cheapjumpstartles. There was a scene or 2 that were scary (and one that wasactually very scary to me at least) but mostly the scares were prettytelegraphed. I recommend a watch, but only really for the villain. 6/10
