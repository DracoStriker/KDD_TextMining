I went to an advanced screening after spending the last two weekspummeling through the book. Contrary to what some reviewers are saying,this is not at all close to the book (but that really isn't my mainreason for not being crazy about it). I realize there were some time constraints but this felt like there wasbasically nothing explained about the main character's backgrounds,relationships, nor their motivations (specifically Henry Bowers as thebully for hating them SO much is just assumed to be "because he's abully"?). At times I was confusing Eddie, Richie, and Stan becausethere was little definable about them besides Stan wearing a yarmulketo identify him as Jewish, and Richie wearing glasses - it felt likethese physical attributes were necessary because nothing distinguishedtheir personalities. Pennywise was cast very well and I loved his voice and overallcreepiness, but it couldn't make up for the fact that every time he andthe main character's met it felt like a "Tom and Jerry" routine. Theyencounter him, he bumbles it or they do something random, and he runsoff. Overall I just left feeling like there was so much that could have beenexpanded (both story and character-wise) given the 135 minute runningtime. I wasn't a huge fan of the 1990 TV miniseries (probably since itwas 20 years after it came out that I first saw it) but it was moreaccurate and explained the relationships more than this movie. I justfeel like I would have liked this more if it was maybe called somethingelse. As it is, this is not a movie version of the book 'It', but atotally different story using the same character's names.
