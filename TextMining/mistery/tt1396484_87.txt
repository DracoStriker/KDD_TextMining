As a horror lover and addict, i was absolutely disappointed. I wasextremely excited to see this movie until it started to play in thetheatre. About five minutes in and I was not intrigued at all. What waseven the point of this movie? The story line? What even story line didit even have?! There was so many characters I couldn't even keep track.All penny wise even did was just scream and things came out of hismouth. This movie does not deserve an 8.2 what so ever. I hope peoplerealize how bad this movie actually is. I'm the type to usually jump atscenes even if I know someone's about to jump out. And not once did Ieven jump. I have never been so excited for a movie and be sodisappointed. I imply if you're not even scared of clowns don't evensee this movie cause you're just waiting your time.
