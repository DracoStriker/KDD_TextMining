It was well acted, and had a lot of creepy scenes. THe guy playing theclown (Bill Skarsgard) was creepier than the one in the mini-series(Tim Curry). I enjoyed the comedy and the chemistry between all theleads. However, I read the book as well, and thought that some otherscenes from the novel were cut that shouldn't have been. I believe themovie could've been scarier, and maybe the second half will be, sinceit will involve the kids as adults. I give it and 8 out of 10. By theway, I did enjoy the mini-series as well, but it wasn't as good as thismovie.
