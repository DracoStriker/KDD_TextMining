I absolutely loved it. I've waited so many years to see Roland theGunslinger on the movie screen, and he didn't disappoint. This movie was marketed incorrectly; it is not The Dark Tower, it isThe Dark Tower Chapter 8 (an optional chapter). You can watch thischapter of the story without reading the others as it stands aloneoutside of the saga detailed in the books.You should watch it even just for the fact that it is the only movie sofar set in the universe outside of ours that links all of StephenKing's works together. My brother and father have never read any of thebooks, and we just got back from the cinema - we all enjoyed it.Good fun. I'm not surprised to see this film has suffered from harshcriticism, mainly revolving around the fact it is not faithful to theoriginal story, but the creators of this film are very clear in theirintentions and deliberately presented a message to the existing readersand fans within the trailers of what to expect. Anyone who read all ofthe books in order will understand why this film is different, and howit fits in to the saga.I thoroughly enjoyed this slightly absurd and visually awesome StephenKing horror/adventure movie, it was great.
