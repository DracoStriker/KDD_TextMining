First, the biggest problem is everyone thinks this is the start of theDark Tower series of novels, it isn't and never was. The writer anddirector have always said this is a sequel to the books (and those whoread the last book in the series and read the section King warned younot to understand that this take place after it). That being said andonce understood the movie becomes fantastic. They aren't retelling thestory from the novels they are simply continuing spinning the wheel.Now as for the acting Idris Elba is fantastic as Roland, the man inBlack's motivating factors and why it differs from the books as it doesis very well conceived. The world is well thought out and as the novelsoften did relate back to other of King's work in a logical way (TheShining, Dead Zone, etc). All in all it is a great movie. I just wishthe reviewers and critics understood better what it was so it couldhave gotten a better shake.
