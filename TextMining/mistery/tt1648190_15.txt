Despite all of the negative reviews I really enjoyed this movie. If youread the books then you have to go in to this movie with theunderstanding that this is NOT a screen adaption of the book. If thatis what you are expecting then you will be highly disappointed (and I'mguessing that this is why it has so many negative reviews)! In factabout the only things that this movie has in common with the book arethat there is a gunslinger, there is a man in black and there is atower. Similarities end there! LOL! However, like I said I reallyenjoyed this movie. Just keep in mind that it is a film that is kind ofsort of set in the Dark Tower universe and that it is not any one ofthe actual novels that you may have read. Matthew McConaughey and IdrisElba both deliver great performances as Walter (the man in black) andRoland (the gunslinger) I was expecting a much longer epic of a movieand thought that it was a tad short which may explain why my son saidthat he thought the story was rushed. Anyway two thumbs up from me! I'msure that someone will trash me now for liking this movie but I didreally like it, in fact I thought it was a minor epic. I would give it4 out of 5 stars!
