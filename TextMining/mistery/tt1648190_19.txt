Fans of King's books appear to be unable to judge this movie on it'sown merits. I think it was well put together and very entertaining.Adaptations of King's work are always difficult and the screenwritershave chosen not to attempt the impossible task of incorporating all thefacets of multiple books in one movie. They simply used whateverconcepts and details they wanted to. If you enjoy it for what it'sworth, you'll have a good time ;-)
