I do like Steven King. I think. I've never read a single book, but Iwatched the Stand as a kid on TV, Golden Years, It etc. The more easilyconsumed Steven King. The pure horror movies never did it for me (TheMist was good.) Shawshank is in my top 5, as it seems to be with mostpeople. The books were around though. My dad read them. I followingthis movie in development as it was the last one I saw him reading andit seemed everyone had Lord of the Rings type hope for this. The fanswere wildly disappointed it would seem (at least they have It). Fromwhat I gather, it's condensing 8 books into an hour and a half. Butwhat a glorious hour and a half it was. I'm intrigued to read that The Good, the Bad and the Ugly were one ofKing's inspirations. Also in my top 5. This isn't going to be one of those reviews that summaries the moviecompletely into 3 paragraphs. I hate trailers that give away the entiremovie and I hate reviews that do the same. Instead, I just want tocongratulate the people who made this movie, as it was the mostunexpected yet enjoyable movie I've seen this year. It's so rare in aHollywood film for it to not be so derivative. Every genre seems to bemashed up into this tight little hour and half package. It's absolutelyworth your time. Ignore the controversy, the bashing, the King originif that's normally not your thing.Now that I've seen the movie, I'm excited that a TV show might fleshout more of the story. TV always does a better job of that anyways.
