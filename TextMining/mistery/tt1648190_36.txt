I have read a good number of the Dark Tower series of books by StephenKing and I'd rate them as some of his very best work.I was then hugely excited and then quickly disappointed by thecinematic interpretation of King's work. The Dark Tower could best bedescribed as the "Coles Notes" version of the books. Whilst Coles hadtheir place summarizing often complex literary works for confusedstudents, the abbreviated silver screen version of the Dark Towerseries is disappointing. Worse still its unfaithful to the books. Roland Deschain, "theGunslinger", indisputably the main character in the books is "sidelined" in favor of an important but more marginal character, "the boy",Jake Chambers. Its a naff move that disrupts the focus and displacesthe context of the story. The result is a film with a "boys own" feel. There are a few darkmoments but they in no way capture the atmosphere of the original bookswhich are dark, gritty and nihilistic, in a Clint Eastwood's, "TheUnforgiven", on steroids kind of way. Idris Elba is a great casting choice for Roland but the role he is castin provides limited opportunity for character development. Jake'scharacter, the overlooked, unloved son of the books, fares littlebetter. Suffice to say, the cinematic Dark Tower is, to my mind, a missedopportunity that seems unable to take advantage of the wonderfulmaterial on offer. Three out of ten from me.
