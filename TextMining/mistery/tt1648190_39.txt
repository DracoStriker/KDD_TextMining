Dreadful. Dreadful. Mind-numbingly awful. I just caught this on XfinityComcast for a $5.99 rental. This POS made $111 million at the boxoffice - can't figure out why . Good actors thrown in the trash bin ofpoor plotting, writing, - this was a video game, not a movie. IdrisElba, he of "Luther" brilliance with Ruth Wilson, Matthew McConaughy("True Detective" with Harrelson), Katheryn Winnick absolutely great asLagertha, Ragnar's wife in the "Vikings". Are they that desperate formoney? TV these days offers a lot more than the big screen - theacting, character arcs are so much richer. Example: Peaky Blinders(where Cillian Murphy excels as Tommy Shelby) for great writing,editing, cinematography, music and characters.
