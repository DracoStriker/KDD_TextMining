Usinghis drawing, he locates the house of his nightmares, He discovers aportal to a place called Mid-World inside the house. He stumbles uponthe Gunslinger Roland that explains that the universe is supported bythe tower and the Man in Black wants to fall it down to unleashmonsters from other dimension to the universe. Further, Jake haspowerful psychic powers capable to destroy the tower. Now the last hopeof Earth and the universe is Gunslinger that is protecting Jake. "The Dark Tower" is a watchable but forgettable adventure with a storythat gives the sensation that was made in a hurry and something ismissing despite the cast and the good CGI. One of the greatestattraction is Katheryn "Lagherta" Winnick, but her participation isalmost a cameo with a minor role. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "A Torre Negra" ("The Black Tower")
