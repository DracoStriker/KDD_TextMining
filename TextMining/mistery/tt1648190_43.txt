Young regular kid discovers his visions are not a sign of mentalillness, encounters absolute evil, finds an adult mentor that teacheshim what to do, then does it, pretty much by luck and not any kind ofreal effort or training. It is your average young adult scenario,banking heavily on Dunning Kruger and Matthew McConaughey as a solid,albeit cardboard, villain.Despite being as average as they come, I liked the young lead. In fact,I think the only actor who stuck like a sore thumb as really bad wasthe step father guy. However, that doesn't mean that talented actorswere not completely underused: Jackie Earle Haley as a lacklusterlackey, José Zúñiga and Dennis Haysbert for single scenes and so on. Imean, Abbey Lee got more scenes just because she's a hot Australianchick.Bottom line: I don't know what the books were about, but there are atleast seven of them, so I guess the film has little to do with them. Assuch, it was pretty average.
