It keeps up a palpable tensity through out the movie. I enjoyed itimmensely. It does not have the cussing and sex and double entendres'that could make it an "adult" movie.It is action and adventurous, andhas shooting scenes and highly intense scenes, but unlike many recentmovies, it is not a comedy and is not funny, but is fun. There are onlyone or two joke like lines. The main good guys are written well, butwith very little background. The secondary characters have even lessbackground, but for this movie, it doesn't seem necessary. The scriptis written well and the actors are excellent in their characters aswell as working working well together. The plot is good/basic, but witheverything working for it, the movie excels.
