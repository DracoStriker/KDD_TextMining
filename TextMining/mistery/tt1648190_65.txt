I have read the entire series many times over. I did not go inexpecting the masterpiece that is the entire series condensed into afew hours of film. In short, I loved it. Idris Elba did an amazing jobof capturing the character Roland Deschain and key aspects of what itis that makes him The Gunslinger. McConaughey? A polished modernWalter. Balancing between the two the dynamics and never endingstruggle between what makes the series, The Dark Tower. It has beenmentioned time and again, the series makes it very clear there are manyworlds. Why traditionalist can't grasp that fact is frankly puzzling.The sheer volume of lore contained within the books that comprise theDark Tower is staggering and rich enough for many films to follow ifthey chose to do so. So if I loved it, why 9 stars? The ending. It waslacking in my opinion and lacked the strength required.
