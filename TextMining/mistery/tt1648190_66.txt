I thought it was an enjoyable movie. Many seem to give it harsh reviewsbut I thought it was just a good adventure movie. I find most moviesadapted from Stephen King novels are usually horribly done. This I feltwas probably one of the best done adaptations. I don't remember much ofthe books anymore as its been probably 6 plus years since I read thembut it did bring back glimpses of the books for me. So I enjoyed you.Don't compare it to the novels, just enjoy the show! Hopefully theycontinue the series
