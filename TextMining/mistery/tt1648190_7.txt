I loved The Dark Tower, I think the movie was entertaining and I lovedthe story. Idris Elba and Tom Taylor were awesome together and playedwell together. I liked the way they went from New York to Africa andback and forth. The look of the film, the cinematography was amazing. Ido not see why people would not like this movie. People are alwaysgoing to have a problem with book series and remakes because it seemslike nobody can ever get it perfect. I did not read the books and didnot know what this movie was about and I loved it. Matthew was great asthe villain and I think Claudia Kim is beautiful. If you haven't seenThe Dark Tower, just give it a chance. This film does not start outslow either it gets right to the story. Go see it!
