With King adaptations it is usually a miss. Same for this movie. I donot even know where to begin how bad this is.This movie is just an incoherent mess. It feels like the script wasre-written over and over again by different writers and then they tookrandom pages from each re-write, went on set and shoot it. The production value is quite high though and the movies is doneprofessionally. But you do not care about the characters or the storyat all - if you are able to identify it. The movie is salted with somecool scenes designed to appeal to an young teen audience. But thatdoesn't make a movie and for sure is not the foundation for a moviefranchise.The casting choices are extremely bad for whatever reason. Many of theactors feel like the wrong choice right from the start. Probably aresult of trying to attach some names to the project, though they did adecent job.The directing and cinematography is uninspired. All involved partiesjust did their job and didn't care much about the project at all. Theyknow they couldn't salvage the convoluted mess the script is.Best part of the movie is probably the opening sequence and that isusually a bad sign for any movie. It would have been a better choice to make a TV show out of this andand actually tell a story. I haven't read the books and not planning todo so, but I am sure they have much more story and characterdevelopment to offer.Not much else to say about this movie. It is the usual bad movie youexpect when you hear Stephen King adaptation. You can count on one handwhich of the many are decent movies.I give this 3 out of 10 because of a few cool scenes. Don't botherwatching it. Though if you are 12 and under and very easily entertainedyou might like this.
