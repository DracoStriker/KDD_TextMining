I'll try to skip here the scope of the altogether nine books of thisstory, and focus on the movie only. As a movie, this is not bad. Thedirection is correct, cast is bit overkill (what the hell are Mr. Elbaand Mr. McConaughey doing here?! They are excellent in their roles butthis is far too much for such a crippled story and a movie that doesnot even reach 100 minutes!), editing is perfect, music very good,camera work perfect, sfx nice and serving the purpose. Not much to sayagainst it. However, the movie is too short. So many questions leftunanswered, so many characters underdeveloped and so on. This, in thisform, looks as a hollow fairy tale with a lot of omitted opportunities.B-action movie at its best. And it was so wrong to tie it to the DarkTower novel series. This could function as a pilot for a TV series ofat least 13 episodes. Therefore only 6 stars. And a message toproducers: do not attempt to do a job unless you can finish itproperly. In this manner all you make is a mess.
