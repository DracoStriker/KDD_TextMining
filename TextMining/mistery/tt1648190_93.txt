I have read the series. To be honest its been a while since I Did.While the Majority of the Critics give it a thumbs down there is toomuch micro analyzing the books with Movies. You can Never... never takea book an turn it into a movie exactly. The magic on paper is specialand will never be put into a movie. There is nothing wrong with it. Isaw it. You are never going to get a complex series in a movie like youexpect. It would take over 10 films to work out Kings Creation. I likedit regardless of some of you more critical(so called) experts. Justenjoy it and be entertained. Life is too short to micro everything.
