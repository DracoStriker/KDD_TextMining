The Dark Tower is part of a really good movie. The problem is that it'sa seemingly random collection of pieces of a good movie.McConaughey's and Elba's performances are top-notch?they both clearlyunderstand their characters well and can make the roles seemeffortless. There are other good performances, but they're all so shortthat you don't get much time to appreciate them.The final battle between Roland and Walter is depicted exactly the waya final battle between two immensely, supernaturally powerfulcharacters should be: brutal, messy, and SHORT. There's no beatingaround the bush.With so many things to like, it's a shame that the film ends up soultimately disappointing. And it didn't have to be that way.The big problem is that everything happens just so fast that there's notime for the viewer to understand or absorb what's going on. It's acombination of the movie being so darn short (barely an hour and ahalf) and trying to fit a story drawn from seven lengthy novels into asingle feature film of *any* length, much less 90 minutes. Even just anadditional 30 minutes would have given the film some breathing room forcharacter development and plot exposition.I cannot recommend this film based on fidelity to the books, or qualityof writing, or anything else, save one exception: It's worth seeing forElba's and McConaughey's performances. Beyond that, this is just onemore entry in the long list of "should've been better" films of StephenKing writings.
