Obviously we have seen different movies. Alfredson's The snowman is anexcellent piece of modern cinema, built not on the conventions of athriller, like Nesbo's book(although of course it works as a thriller),but on the tensions between the unfolding images, the mesmerizingeffect of a hypnotic pace that encloses us in a dark and cold vision,the glorious revelations of landscapes(city landscapes, physicallandscapes and human ones)that reveal themselves at certain pointsfilling our regard with a sense of beauty. As the film went on, I feltimmersed in its charm, building to an ending that creates not so muchthe tension one hopes to meet in a thriller, but a dark feeling, firstas the killer sinks helplessly in the icy water(in a glimpse,as thefilm's narrative economy is extraordinary all the way through, incontrast with some other film that met glorious critical applause thesedays but needed 2.45 minutes of boring storytelling to make everythingexplicit), and second in the short epilogue, which is filmed in a waythat creates a very strong impression, stressed by the music,leaving meshocked and thoughtful on the way out. I'll take it! .The snowman is anabsolute masterpiece that deserves to be rediscovered in the farfuture, like many movies of the past have at some point been.
