What happened to this movie ?That's a much more interesting question, than anything this destroyedartifact has to offer?Everything about this project looked so good: World class cast,director, cinematographer, editors, producers, writer, all based on abestselling thriller: I couldn't wait to see it.Executive producer Martin Scorsese even wanted to direct it himselfyears ago, so it couldn't possibly be bad, because that man knows hisstuff, right?I didn't read the novel and avoided any plot description because Iwanted to enjoy a good thriller without knowing too much. But if anyonetells you, that he 'understood' the plot and character motivations ofthis mess, then you know he's lying or he's talking about the novel.The director Tomas Alfredson - who did such a fantastic job on "Tinker,Tailer, Soldier Spy", which was hard to follow sometimes, too, but didmake sense - said in an interview, that 10-15 % of the screenplay werenot shot. No joke. And these were pretty important pages, it seems,because the lead characters sometimes behave in incomprehensible ways.What the motivation of the killer was, is still an enigma to me.Because key scenes were missing, the producers probably thought: "Hey,we'll just hire the best editors and they'll solve the problemsomehow!" Thelma Schoonmaker and Claire Simpson are indeed two of thebest editors in the world, but if not even they could constructsomething like a story out of the footage, then something went deeplywrong during the shoot.The footage itself looks great. Oscar winner Dion Beebe is at the topof his game here and every shot is artfully composed and feels justright: Cold, sinister, grey, realistic, but still beautifully stylized.We are talking here about award-worthy cinematography, no less.The acting is good, too, especially the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson andMichael Fassbender, who is too young for this part, but gives a decentperformance.Yes, there are some ridiculous scenes, especially the idiotic showdown,where Harry Hole survives and catches the killer by pure coincidence,but good producers could have fixed this through re-shoots. They didn'teven try, it seems. They just gave up, because it was a lost cause.How could the producers, screenwriters and director destroy a projectthat had so much going for it ?This is one of the worst films of the year & one of the strangest filmartifacts ever released in cinemas. It could serve as an example forfilmmakers how NOT to edit a film or how NOT to tell a story.I only gave it 2/10 because of the cinematography & I felt sorry forthe actors.A crime against cinema.
