As I read many reviews the two things people hate this movie for is:It's a crime-thriller and not a horror story like the book was. BecauseI haven't read the book I can't say on what level they differ, but themovie is still very interesting and exciting. And the other thing isthe ending. I agree that it comes a bit fast and leaves you kindahanging, BUT it fits the whole frosty northern scenery well and makesthe story line a full circle.I really enjoyed it, can't really understand why it gets so much hate.
