For a start, my way into this is without having read any of the HarryHole novels (which all the critics seems to have). So I can look atthis movie from a somewhat more objective view and, I conclude, it'snot bad. To me this feels like more of a super hero movie in genre inthat the characters, both the likable and the less likable charactersare a bit flat, I admit that but I think it works out well (this is whyit reminds me of a classic super hero movie).Especially I like the secondary story told flashbacks about Rafto, thedrunken police man, intriguingly played by Val Kilmer. Also RebeccaFerguson and J.K. Simmons do good appearances. Michael Fassbenderobviously the key performer, doing an excellent and trustworthyappearance. Although not as good as "Tinker, Solder, Sailor, Spy" (reg:Tomas Alfredson) or "The Dark Knight" (reg: Christopher Nolan), I thinkAlfredson this time is somehow within range of these movies on certainelements (such as scenery, pace, intriguing social milieu).I hear the novels are fast and direct, while I think the movie is a mixbetween an action and slow paced movie. Therefor I think you should notwatch this as 1) a direct comparison to the books, or 2) towards a book(which you haven't read) but heard excellent things about, and as badcomparisons between the book and the movie.
