'THE SNOWMAN': Three Stars (Out of Five)The new crime-mystery/horror flick, based on the best selling novel (ofthe same name) by Jo Nesbo. It tells the story of an Oslo detective,that's investigating a series of murders committed by a serial killerthat uses snowmen as their calling card. It was directed by TomasAlfredson (who also helmed the critically acclaimed thrillers 'TINKERTAILOR SOLDIER SPY' and 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN'), and it was written byHossein Amini, Soren Sveistrup and Peter Straughan (who also co- wrote'TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY'). The film stars Michael Fassbender,Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, J.K. Simmons, Val Kilmer, TobyJones, Chloe Sevigny and James D'Arcy. It's gotten mostly negativereviews from critics, and it's a bomb at the Box Office as well. Ifound it to be effectively creepy at times, but it's also mostly just abore. Harry Hole (Fassbender) is the lead detective of a special crime unitin Oslo. With the help of a new recruit, Katrine Bratt (Ferguson), he'sput in charge of a missing person's case. The two later learn that aserial killer who uses snowmen as their calling card, is most likelyresponsible. Bratt and Hole work together to find out the killer'sidentity and stop his madness. The movie is really slow-paced at first, it does pick up in the secondhalf though. It's got a very creepy, disturbing feel to it as well, andFassbender is good in the lead. The characters aren't very welldeveloped though, and the movie is mostly just dull. It might be worthwatching late one night on Netflix still though.
