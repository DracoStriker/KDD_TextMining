Having read some of the negative comments I was determined to like thismovie, willing to give it a shot. I loved the book and thought thatmaybe, the users on this website were, somehow, wrong.The movie started of quite abruptly, dark and suspenseful, really likedthe start of it. The middle part of the movie was really slow. I gotthe feeling they were trying, note i wrote trying, to give thecharacters some depth. Didn't really work that well...The ending of this movie was so unsatisfying and lame, it was too easy. What I did like was the scenery & of course Fassbender, I thought heportrayed quite a good Hary Hole.I'm not going to watch this one again, nor am I going to buy it on DVD.Too bad because I really wanted this to have been a fantastic movie.
