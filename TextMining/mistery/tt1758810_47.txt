I don't know what with book world nowadays if this was even remotelyget popularity. Its second-rate story about serial killer, where authoreven didn't bather do some realistic stuff an display even remotelynatural relationship between maniac and cop. No, all we have a storywritten for story, and that's look like fairy tail with cheap morale atthe end. Really too long for this trash ending. When I watched this athink about how good was "The Silence of the Lambs". But this... justcrap.
