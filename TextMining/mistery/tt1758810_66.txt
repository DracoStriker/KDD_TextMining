After seeing the trailer for The Snowman I couldn't wait to see thefilm, but while watching it in the theater, I couldn't wait for it toend so I could go Pee. I was really looking forward to the CREEP FACTORbut got very little and was bored through most of the film. Notfamiliar with the book, but I'd bet too much from the book (additionalstory lines)was put in the script that took away from what should havebeen the focus of the film, the detective against the killer. I gotlost in what and or why, some characters were in the film. If you areadding characters, make them possible killers. Tease the mind of theviewer. There was basically no direct conflict between the hero and thekiller until the very end. And the ending itself was not onlypredictable but too coincidental. Definitely a PASS. And I'm sorry tosay that. I thought it might get to the level or surpass The Girl withthe Dragon Tattoo.
