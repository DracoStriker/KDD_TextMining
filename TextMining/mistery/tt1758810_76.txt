Beautiful winter cinematography, excellent soundtrack, and stellar castwere ruined by the way the plot was presented. I was intrigued in thebeginning but once the movie picked up pace in the middle, way too manyirrelevant short scenes were taking place in parallel and dumped on theviewer, and I found myself fighting to not fall asleep. The end waslaughable in its futile attempts to be dramatic. The whole story feltincredibly amateurish to the point of ridiculous.
