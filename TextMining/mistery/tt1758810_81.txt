Right in the beginning I remember thinking that one scene was going tobe like something from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but thennothing happened. And nothing kept happening for a long, long time. Igot pretty quickly that the main character is tragically flawed. Stopshoving it down my throat and get to a story. For a long time I feltlike I was watching Ralph Mellish by Monty Python, but it wasn't funny.It had elements that I usually really like in a film, like a story nottold in chronological order, twins, and J.K. Simmons. But everythingthat this movie did was pure frustration. There was no focus and itdrifted everywhere. The lead character kept overlooking the mostobvious clues, but I guess that is what happens when your maincharacter is overly flawed and not at all relatable in anyway. Hewasn't a protagonist, antagonist, hero, or anti-hero. He was just therefor most of the movie.If you like Nordic scenery, then this is a great movie. Just wait forit to come out on HBO or Netflix. The main character's name is HarryHole and that is exactly were it feels like this movie came from. Thetrailer was better than the movie.In one scene a nipple was shown and that was my favorite part of themovie. Not because there was anything special about that scene, butbecause the 70ish year old guy behind me chucked like a little boy whenhe saw it and he was sitting next to his wife. I mas more entertainedby the audience than the movie. Go see Victoria & Abdul instead. You'llthank me.
