Sadly this was an awful movie. There are several parts of the moviethat seems to have been rushed since you can not possibly understandthe connections in the investigation without reading the book. The worst thing out of all was the fact that some horrendous editingreplaced Val Kilmers own voice with a complete missmatch, both visiblyand verbally.
