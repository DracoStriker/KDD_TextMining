The original Blade Runner is one of my favourite films so I was reallylooking forward to this one. What a disappointment. If I wasn't in thecompany of others I would of walked out early. I left the cinemafeeling annoyed that I had to sit through this overlong monotonousfilm. The storyline is dragged out with the main character just goingfrom place to place to investigate something like in a video game. Atthe beginning he is in a fight scene and you find out he is basicallyindestructible. The replicants are now terminators. This leaves out anysuspense that he is in danger. The first film was kind of believable,the city was overcrowded and the building were decaying - it hadatmosphere. This one looked like a more modern city with a lot ofemptiness. The technology has advanced so much that he now has a solidlight fully realistic AI holographic companion that operates from asmall device he can keep in his pocket. If you think about it why arethey so desperate to increase replicant slave labour production whenthey are capable of building AI robots that can be enveloped withholographic light to look human. They still have the blurry 1950 TVquality monitors to echo the first film but the supposed technologyjump does not make sense. The music by Vangelis was one of the mostimportant parts of the original. He conveyed through the use ofsynthesisers and traditional instruments a sense of awe and wonder,beauty and the sadness of a dystopian world. Johann Johannsson wasoriginally commissioned to score the film and I think he would of donea great job but they decided for some reason it was not Hollywoodsounding enough so they bought in Hans Zimmer. What a disaster. Itmight as well be the music from Batman VS Alien. Just lots of loudnoise. The original was a box office failure that became a cultclassic. This is just a failure.
