My boyfriend and I watched Blade Runner 2049 the sequel to Blade Runner(1982) on Friday morning at the local cinema. Perhaps we should haveopted to watch it in 3D because the shots were wide and there was quitea bit of scenery that was a work of art.With that said, I felt as if Blade Runner is trying to create a sequelfor itself more than offer the viewer a film. There are more questionscreated than answers are given. The 'bad guy' is still out there, hisscheme is still intact and on the other side an army has amassed and isready to strike. We are told about the army, but nothing has happenedyet.Problem is I paid to watch a film and I want a beginning, middle and anend. I didn't at for the director to tell me I have to come back nextyear.Again, the images on the screen were rich and I wish I can satisfy myboyfriend like Luv and Joi can, but otherwise we are a little tired ofMarvel universe, Star Wars remakes and Batman sequels. Please give us agood film.
