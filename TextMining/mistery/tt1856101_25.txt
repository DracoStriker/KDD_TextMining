I didn't realise 2049 also was the actual length of the film! It surefelt like it! 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and anembarrassingly weak story. Hard to believe Ridley Scott really madethis!The first Blade Runner worked the pace of the film brilliantly up tothe powerful ending. The story was a rather simple sci-fi noirdetective story with a twist. It made some huge comments on humanityand what kind of future we want. It worked on so many levels. It couldbe viewed as a simple sci-fi detective story or as a great spiritualjourney that asked all the big questions. "And what can your maker dofor you?".The first Blade Runner had so many great lines but with 2049 I cannotremember a single quotable line. 2049 completely lacks all which madethe original the best sci-fi movie ever. I take the same view as RutgerHauer recently did. Why even try to do a second one? It would be aspainting a second Mona Lisa. Or building another Eiffel tower.A huge disappointment of a sequel that should never have been made.
