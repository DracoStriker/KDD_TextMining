If you haven't seen the original, don't you'll wish you would havenever watched this one.The remake has some of the best visuals I'veseen in any movie, that does not make for a complete movie.Should haveknown from the IMDb (too high) of rating that there was somethingafoot. Turns out my senses was correct.
