Anticlimactic and over-complicated in some places, generally boring. The plot made up entirely on excuses after excuses. It's more visual experience rather than sensual.And that visuals is pretty superficial and not entirely fits into builtup environment so it feels very inconsistent. From that type of visualconcept development and detailed design you definitely expect somethingmore, than movie offers you.Overall, it's pretty mediocre and disappointing experience for me.
