I have not seen such a badly made movie in a really long time. The onlything good about this movie is the actors. who did a good job in doingwhat they were told to. But the story is a pathetic layering of atypical family drama projected onto flying cars that is supposed to beour future. The jest of story, we industrialize ruthlessly to shrednature and then struggle to find a human emotion within ourselves andwage a war to hold on to it. Pathetic, heard many times, over and over.I am not sure if the theme was disguised as to give a facade of art orwas so poorly directed that it was not even strongly projected. Eitherway, it gave me headaches. And the music was so grossly out of syncwith the picture, it made no sense remotely. The unnecessary loudnoises had not 1% context with what was happening on screen.Ridiculously long, out of context, poor direction, senseless soundeffects, sorry picture of the story. sheer torture to sit through it.
