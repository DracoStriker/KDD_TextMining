This movie was so bad I can't put into words. I loved Blade Runner butthis sequel is so bad I can no longer watch the original. Music over the top Acting nonexistent Length, felt like 6 hours,and notin a good wayAs people left the theater I saw shaking heads.Don't understand people raving about it. They must be connected to thefilm somehow. Save your money, watch the original and don't let this ruin it for youlike it did for me
