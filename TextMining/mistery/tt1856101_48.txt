There are some movies that get made that should never be diluted by asequel. This movie is one of them. Following in the footsteps of hisabsolutely terrible Arrival (The aliens don't understand our concept oftime. Five minutes later it's we'll be back for your help in 3000years). Dennis Villaneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is too long, too dull andtoo derivative of the original. A sequel that's based on what I feel isa lame story line (which I can't give away simply because it's a majorspoiler). While the look of the film is in line with the original, ifnot dirtier, the movie itself really goes nowhere. I can see why itbombed at the theaters. It really isn't for anyone who's not a fan ofthe original. It's another in Ridley Scott's recent line of failures(even though he only produced it. It want's to be a smart movie, buthonestly, the only smart movie I've seen recently is Ex Machina, whichwas brilliant, something this movie isn't. There are parts that wereinteresting, but overall the entire film just plods from scene toscene. Ryan Gosling's inability to emote doesn't help this. Nor doeswaiting nearly 2/3rds of a too long run time for Harrison Ford's RickDeckard to show up. I have to say that I wasn't looking forward to thisfilm and now that I've seen it, I'm disappointed.
