The movie is definitely a masterpiece in terms of cinematography. RyanGosling does a decent job as well. That's where it ends though. Themost frustrating part about it is how it insults the intelligence ofthe viewer. While the original movie was laid down like a puzzle (theunicorn dreams and origami at different moments in the movie) this onejust spells out everything to make sure the dumbest person could getit. The only thing missing was a big sign flashing: "pay attentionhere" . The flashbacks were placed totally artificially and the wholesequence was so linear it hurts. Also the whole story was way tooshallow and included too many cheap tearjerkers.Another frustrating thing is how, just like all the other recentreboots, it just runs on pure nostalgia while adding virtually nothingnew. Edward James Olmos's appearance is a perfect example. The shortscene involving him adds nothing to the story. It's just there becausethey had to find some reason to put him in the movie.They should have left the original movie alone.
