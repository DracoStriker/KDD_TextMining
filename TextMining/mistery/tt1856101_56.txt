I have noticed a trend that is choking Hollywood and mainstream filmmaking and I would like to address it. Hollywood is making money now,but slowly and surely the movie watching public is awakening to what ishappening and this is going to spell trouble for Hollywood. So, aftercoming back from Blade Runner this evening I want to make the followingpoints: 1- Not every film needs a sequel 9or prequel or remake orwhatever). The first Blade Runner was indeed impressive (if we ignorethe happy ending and unicorn of the theatrical release). It wassupported by a Dick novel and great acting by the likes of Rutger Hauerand Edward James Olmos. Vangelis' score was peerless and so was thevision of the future. yet, did it beg for a sequel? No, absolutely no.BR 2049 has fantastic, truly superb, CGI, that is large and impressive,but that is all it has going for it.2- Length. Directors have been making films longer and longer. This maybe warranted here and there, but let me be honest. I dozed off once for10-15 minutes. Please stop making these films longer and longer. Youare not Kurosawa and this is not Seven Samurai.This is not the worst film of the decade (that award probably goes toThe Force Awakens by cover version promoter JJ Abrams just for sheerplagiarism and the studio's lie that it is a sequel while it was areboot), but other than moments of genius, a good CGI and an underlyingimportant message BR 2049 suffers from too many flaws.Thanks for reading.
