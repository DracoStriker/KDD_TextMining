Blade runner was not an enjoyable movie for me. People are praising theatmosphere. They are correct to do so, however there is more to a moviethen atmosphere.The movie was really slow, even boring. I think it really comes down tothree things. The atmosphere was dark and depressing, the plot was veryslow to develop, the main character was unemotional. Any one of thosethings, or even two and it could still have worked, but with all threemakes the movie slow and plodding. And that is besides the fact thatthe thing the bad guy was after just did not make sense, and theycovered it up by making him not wholly rational even though he was aCEO of one of the largest companies on Earth.The original movie was good in large part because of the gray, becauseof the unknowns in it. Were Replicants machines or not? Was Decker aReplicant or not? Was what he was doing right or not? The new one has amore cookie cutter plot, there are bad guys and good guys and they makeclear early on that the Replicants are human.www.JoshuaLawrencePike.com
