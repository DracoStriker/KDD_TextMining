Denis Villeneuve has become an interesting director; INCENDIES wasinteresting, PRISONERS quite cynical, ENEMY and SICARIO realmasterpieces. Not that fond of ARRIVAL but anyway it was acceptable. Iam not a huge fan of Ridley Scott; I always believe that his visualsand concepts were larger and more interesting than the movies hecrafted. Take for example PROMETHEUS and its follow up ALIEN CONVENANT.The first one was an interesting concept; completely destroyed in thefollow up. Villeneuve was able to expand the BLADE RUNNER concept butinstead of developing his ideas he dedicated more the visuals andexpanded the movie to 2 hours and 44 minutes; which is at least onehour more than it needed to be. BLADE RUNNER was far from an actionflick with a running time below two hours was able to deliver an idea;this one only delivers boredom. Lots of unnecessary over extendedscenes that even great actors like Ryan Gosling have trouble to dealingwith. And after almost three hours; the ending is simplistic and takeaway any interesting concept that could came earlier. Basically thefinal scenes leave the viewer expecting for more and obviouslyfrustrated.In brief; if you are a hard fan of the original get good nap beforeentering the theater; you are going to fall sleep anyway but at leastnot so often.
