...the return of the giant Atari sign from the original Blade Runner.OK, quick story synopsis. Bones found of a Replicant who's given birth.How was it possible and where is the child (now adult)?I'm sorry, but having waited 35 years for this movie it just didn'tpress any buttons for me. It's an hour too long, the story-line is weakto non-existent and doesn't get answered, the theory of Deckard'sorigin is again teased at but not answered (even though there really isvery little in the original to point to him being a repilicant).This is another SFX over substance movie. Looks good, although verydark in the 3D version, but there just doesn't seem to be the energyand edginess of the original. It all seems too NICE. Having seen the original movie over 30 times, I'm not sure I'll botherreturning to this new story. I have to agree with Rutger Hauer abouttrying to add to a perfect movie.
