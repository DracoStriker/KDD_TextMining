This is the first review I have written for a movie and the reason I amwriting this is because this is the worst movie I have ever seen. About45 minutes into the movie I asked my husband if he understood what wasgoing on and he did not either. Not only is it difficult to understandwhat is going on, but it is dark and slow. (many scenes of thecharacters holding their hand out into the fake snow, looking at theirhands. or long shots of the characters staring off into space.) Theonly color in the movie occurred for about 30 seconds when green leaveswere shown as a memory flashback. The gentleman next to us also agreedhe was glad it was over. I suppose that it gets high reviews because ofthe special effects, but without a story line that is interesting andengaging, special effects do nothing for me.
