There were actually defenders of INDIANA JONES AND THE CRYSTAL SKULL,saying the computerized monkeys and the nuked refrigerator (that justhappened to land in the radiation safety zone) were par for thecourse... "After all, in the other movies he climbed under a truckand..." so on and so forth: But when something looks and feels legit,it's completely plausible for the viewer...Like in the original BLADE RUNNER where an opiate haze shrouds acorporate, commercialized yet doomed, dystopian future where rain fallson flying-cars jetting through an eternal night sky of bleak neon,resembling Shanghai in an arcade purgatory: Yet all this visual gloryserved as a backdrop for the job of Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard, aBounty Hunter Assassin aka "Blade Runner," whose assignment was to findand "retire" five Replicants (androids) that are "More Human ThanHuman." Most have already seen the classic 1982 science fiction FilmNoir directed by Ridley Scott, and anyone defending this sequel willprobably say, "Well the first one is long and slow too..."Yeah, sure... Slow like CHINATOWN, with a purpose and destination ?while BLADE RUNNER 2049 has its new youngish Runner... played by asleepy-eyed Ryan Gosling, whose slim shoulders get lost in thesignature manly cop jacket... trudging around without a missioninteresting enough to allow the viewer a break from the navel-gazingexistentialism, which was also part of the original...Only this time, that's just about all there is: Save for random scrapsthat occur few and far, far, far between, leaving the audience to wait,wait and wait some more during snail-paced treks through a murky CGIimitation of the original's groundbreaking special effects. Meanwhile,the side- characters (holograms or robotics) are corny beyond belief:Even a nifty twist-middle wakeup-call quickly comes to nothing: Sothen, can Harrison Ford pick up the pace and make things whole again.Well he answer is... When in Rome...
