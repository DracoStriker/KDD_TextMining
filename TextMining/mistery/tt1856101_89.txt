I loved the original blade runner. It's one of my top 3 movies of alltime. I never had very high expectations for this sequel, because Iknew it could never live up to the original. But I wanted to see it forthe sake of nostalgia and I was genuinely curious to see what they haddecided to do. I'll start with the positive. The cinematography, CGI,and atmosphere generated by the settings were all incredible. I preferthe original's, however, as it had a somewhat "darker" nature to it.That being said, 2049 is Oscar-worthy in these departments. 10/10 here.The music was alright and felt fitting. Now the bad... Which is therest of the film. The plot was entirely underwhelming and underminingthe original, the themes almost coming across as desperate attempts tobe as ground breaking as the original. In fact, I disliked the conceptso much that it took away from the original movie, which sucked. Theacting was mostly poor, though what can one expect from a sullen sulkerlike Gosling (he doesn't act, he just sort of glowers). The lovesub-plot was weak and STRANGE, and Jared Leto... honestly, all I cansay/ask is "what the heck?". Not even Harrison Ford and the nostalgiatrap at the very end of the movie (the music) could save this disasterof a film.In summary, this film is stunning visually, and that's all. Watch itfor what it is: a chance to show off the advances in CGI. Do what Idid, expect the worst. I am still glad I saw it.
