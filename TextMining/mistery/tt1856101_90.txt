I know better now.These guys have destroyed Blade Runner just to release yet anothersequel that should not have been made. Ridley has recently beenactively destroying the Alien legacy and releasing subpar non-stories.Villenueve is going from this to yet another unneeded remake, namelyDune.In short, these guys are now in the same league as JJ Abrams, Paul Feigand Michael Bay. That is sad. Blade Runner deserved a better (andlasting) legacy.BR2049 is so long, so boring and so pointless that one really wonders.It boggles the mind that they released an expensive movie that has nopoint to make and no care to destroy the classicness of Blade Runner.There was a cool headquarters, cool hologram technology and advertisingand sexy women. Those deserve points, but what is with the very cornyand jaded dialogue? the script was bad and the lines were worse.Compare to the original Blade Runner!People, think twice before attending silly Marvel films, boring StarWars films and the next 5 Ghostbusters. They are boring and insult yourintelligence and their legacy. I am done with these thieving sequels.
