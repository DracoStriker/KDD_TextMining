It helps that this movie, packed with violence, has dreamydripping-with-sincerity Ryan Reynolds as a central character. The bigsurprise is how the 'unkillable' Samuel Jackson character comes acrossas lovable, loving, and even heroic.The two have great chemistry in a bickering "I'm starting to like you"way as they discuss their views on their women while shooting upeverything that moves (except the innocent, of course).The plot moves along at a fast clip. There is nothing BUT action on thescreen, it seems - no downtime until the very end of the movie whenSamuel Jackson and Salma Hayek share a moment amid a bar brawl. Andmake it romantic.If you are a fan of this guns-gore-and-guts genre, you will enjoywatching this. It is satisfying when you come home at the end of theday, frustrated and wanting to kick your boss or throw nun-chucks atthe telephone filled with 20 waiting messages from telemarketers andthe dog has just thrown up on the Persian rug. Make a bowl of popcorn,curl up on the sofa, and enjoy!
