Everything about this movie, from the acting and directing to thewriting and special effects, was well done. Samuel L. Jackson and RyanReynolds brought their A-game. I laughed, I gripped the edge of myseat, and when the credits started to roll, I wondered how 2 hours hadgone by so fast. I see a lot of movies, and this was the best actionmovie I've seen in years.
