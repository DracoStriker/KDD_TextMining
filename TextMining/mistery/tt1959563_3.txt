Just watched a sneak preview of The Hit-man's Bodyguard. I had highexpectations given the cast of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson. Themovie exceeded these expectations! Over the top comedy and action --best combination since Deadpool last year. Definitely worth watching!I'm a long-time IMDb user, but this movie was so good, I felt I neededto get an IMDb login so I could review it!Top movie I've seen this year, edging out Baby Driver!
