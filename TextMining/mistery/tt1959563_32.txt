Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson were real funny and this was a actionpacked movie very well worth it to watch at the theater. I really likeit and would give it a 9.5 out of a 10. It had a good story to followand there women Selma Hayek, and Elodie Yung were also hot and playedthere roles GREAT, GREAT movie.
