I read some reviews that trashed this movie and I'm wondering if theseare the same people that thought that Birdman (worst movie ever) wasthe best a couple of years ago. OK...I get it and I understand whypeople are hating on this movie. The movie is violent, predictable andhas a script that is full of foul mouth language. But the beauty of themovie experience is that when you walk into a theater, turn off yourbrain and enjoy this movie for what it is. I laughed out loud andenjoyed this from beginning to end. Yes it is full of unrealisticstunts, bullet dodging and perfect aim by the "good guys" but that iswhat makes it enjoyable. Of course it is it is full of "F" words butthat is what makes this movie fun. Samuel L, Ryan Reynolds and Selma Hayek (who played a surprising role)are fun to watch. Trust me don't go in thinking that this is some typeof Jason Bourne or Jack Ryan spin off because it's not. Just sit backand watch it with the intent on being entertained by this funnyaction/comedy. There are some references to some old movies so you haveto be keen and recognize them.
