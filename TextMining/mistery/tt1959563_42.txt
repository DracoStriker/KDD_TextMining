Samuel L. Jackson plays the hit-man and Ryan Reynolds plays thebodyguard in the action/comedy "The Hit-man's Bodyguard." Why would themost feared hit-man need a bodyguard? Because a dictator is on trialfor war crimes, and the only one who could incriminate him is Jackson.Taking Jackson from prison to the courtroom will be a hell of anordeal, because the dictator has his goons out in force to stop Jacksonfrom testifying. And that's where Reynolds comes in?unofficially hiredby Interpol to protect and escort Jackson to the trial. Unfortunately,both men are sworn enemies, and they may kill each other before the badguys get to them.My most memorable, movie moment of "The Hit-man's Bodyguard" is theflashback scene when Jackson meets his future wife (outrageously playedby Salma Hayek) for the first time. It was funny and sexy with anoverdose of hyper violence."The Hit-man's Bodyguard" is loaded with shenanigans; but this is amovie that isn't meant to be analyzed for story logic. This is a funand very funny, graphically violent movie that shines every timeReynolds and Jackson are on screen together. Kudos to director PatrickHughes for adding energy to the story with his slick direction thatreally complements the script and lead actors.Mannysmemorablemoviemoment
