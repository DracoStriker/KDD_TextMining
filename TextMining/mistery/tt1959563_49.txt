Samuel L Jackson plays a hit man who is in jail while a Russiandictator is on trial at the Hague after killing several opponents.Every witness against him conveniently disappears. Jackson agrees totestify to free his wife who is also in prison. Salma Hayek spews asmany mother f******* as her husband, sometimes in Spanish. and it ishilarious. Ryan Reynolds is a professional body guard who winds upescorting Jackson to the trial while being shot at by Russiangangsters. The violence is unending and Reynolds and Jackson are agreat team. The chemistry is as good as Mel Gibson and Danny Gloverfrom the Lethal Weapon films. I hope that a sequel is made as Iabsolutely loved The Hit Man's Bodyguard.
