Watched the movie about two weeks back. I must say that initially itwas not my first choice. I am a big fan of action and looking at theshowings it was too scientific and didn't interest me that much butnevertheless I ended up watching it because my first choice was? notavailable at a time. I liked that it kept me intrigued and almost was wondering how Samwelland the most respected body guard are going to cross their paths. Itwas interesting, entertaining, funny, memorable and full of action.Probably one of the few movies I would like to watch again. Big up tothe producers.
