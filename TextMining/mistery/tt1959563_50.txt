Jackson and Reynolds are appealing and some of their banter is amusingif not drop dead funny.Their interactions were easily the best part ofthe movie. But the scenes detailing Reynolds relationship with his exare almost cringe worthy.Salma Hayek was good in small role asJackson's wife. Plot was basically Midnight Run with a kick ass hit-maninstead of a wussy accountant and the action scenes ranged in qualityfrom pedestrian to slightly better than competent.Second half bogs downwith too many of them. Would have benefited more from keeping the twoleads together instead of separating them and having them run aroundrescuing each other.All told,a passable but pretty run of the mill timewaster benefiting from solid chemistry between Jackson and Reynolds
