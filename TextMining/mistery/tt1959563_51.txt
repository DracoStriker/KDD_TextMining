I'm Scientific and Technical and if you are toss the Laws of Physicsout the window and your mind, this leaves a great film where the actionsequences are hilarious without any words. The verbal banter and debatebetween Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson results in more action almostalways. I loved the friction between Reynolds as the capable butmentally "bent" assassin turned anti-assassin "unless I absolutely haveto..." and Jackson as get it done by the gun through a hellfire ofbullets by dropping multi bad guys per second. Collateral damage isanother name for "Gotcha Mother F-----!". I now know more "words".When The Hit-man's Bodyguard 2 comes out it will be on my must seelist.
