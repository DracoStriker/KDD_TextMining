what a combination of actors, jackson and reynolds bounce off oneanother perfectly, so much you can believe they were genuineadversaries. the plot is a little weak but thats made up for by theacting and action. definitely a must see movie especially if you love agood shoot em up/ car chase beat em up laced with some laugh out loudcomedy moments !....we loved it and hope to see this acting pair puttogether again in the not too distant future !!...well done. greatmovie !!
