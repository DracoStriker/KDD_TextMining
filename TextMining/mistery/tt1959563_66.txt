As with all films I go to see at the cinema, I always check therating's first. Usually, I agree almost completely with the suggestedaverage user rating. However, I genuinely believe that this film has been underrated. 38% onRotten Tomatoes is just harsh. The 7/10 is a bit better. However,whilst I recognise that this film is no Oscar winning masterpiece, interms of its actual entertaining value it is my second favourite of theyear - losing out only to Baby Driver which was masterfully executedand refreshingly unique. From start to finish the film is explosions and guns. The lines arewitty and I am sure I would have found the scene with the nuns (this isin the trailer) might have been more entertaining viewing for the firsttime. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson are a brilliant duo, and I certainlyhope this film will have a sequel and that it will be just asentertaining as this new film.
