Ryan Reynolds in a buddy movie with Samuel Jackson!? As you can imagineI had very high hopes for this and they were expanded further by thetrailer and brilliant promotion material including The Bodyguard (1992)spoof poster.Within the first 15 minutes I was already appeased, Ryan Reynolds isone of those few guys who just has "It" the natural comedic timing,uncanny charisma and acting ability to boot.The movie is charming, hilarious, action packed and riotous fun.Also featuring Salma Hayek, Elodie Yung and briefly the highlyunderrated English legend Richard E Grant.Yes it does follow a formula you'll be familiar with, you won't seeanything you probably haven't seen before and it's very "Hollywood" butin this case that is just fine.Competently made, brilliantly performed and with a kicking soundtrackto boot.I dislike action films as a rule but some of the sequences even got myblood pumping and being a comedy action a witty quip would alwaysfollow.Though not ground breaking The Hitmans Bodyguard is a great piece offun cinema.The Good: Decent chemistry between leads Ryan Reynolds is an entertainment godElodie Yung Well crafted soundtrack The Bad: Clichéd and a tad predictable Things I learnt from this movie: Mother f**ker is beyond a catchphrase for Jackson now
