I give this 7.5. Sadly, IMDb does not give me the option to givedecimal stars. So I generously round up to an 8. Let me tell you right away: This movie is something you watch with yourbrain turned off while being tipsy after three drinks. The title is "The Hit-man's Bodyguard" starring Samuel Jackson. Thetrailers even over play the motherf****r cliché of Sam Jackson. Rightoff the bat, you expect this movie to be a cliché-fest filled with gunsand off-topic romantic interests. What the movie gets right is the chemistry between two actors: SamuelJackson and Ryan Reynolds. It was brilliant to have these two actors inthe movie. Otherwise, the movie would have been a big fail. These two guys, however, keep the scenes lively through theirexperienced comedy acting. Hell, the scripts were probably written withthese two guys in mind. There are awesome actions sequences and hilarious dialogues included inthis movie, as you would expect from these two actors. If you are not expecting too much and a little tipsy from over- pricedtheater alcohol, you will love this movie.
