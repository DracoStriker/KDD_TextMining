Comedy action drama, set in London and Amsterdam. An odd couple go on akind of buddy road trip.Stars Ryan Reynolds, the 'bodyguard', a former world class securityagent, a wise cracking meticulous planner, he gives us plenty of thatfamiliar 'totally bemused' look he's famous for.Samuel L Jackson, the 'hitman', who is a 'mother-fvking' old schoolimproviser.Salma Hayek is Sam Jackson's very funny incarcerated girlfriend, whowill only be released if Sam testifies when/if they make it toAmsterdam. She's excellent and steals every scene she's in.Gary Oldman plays his usual cliché bad guy character.The plot is the two heroes need to make the trip without either gettingkilled, they don't like each other to start with but a friendshipgrows. On their way there are plenty of car chases, shootouts andplenty of comedy.I laughed pretty much throughout ? Go see this comedy gem.
