You have to go quite beyond "suspend disbelief", you really have to letgo off any sense of... well, sense.But, after you do that, you'll find that the movie is a lot of fun.It's not very funny, it has but a few good jokes, but, it is fun andnot even close to being boring.Also, while senseless, it's not weird, or "countering the laws ofphysics" (too much), or "idiotic"... Things that happen are more-or-less normal things, just pieced up and spiced up to have fun with them.Acting is OK, Reynolds and SamL do their usual thing, but nothingspecial. SamL curses way too much for this character - you don't get tokill > 250 people and live to tell about it if you're so out of control- and cursing doesn't do much here (there's one good joke about it,but, it's way too little for a whole movie of SamL talking...impolitely). Selma Hayek was a misfire, she should be great playing acrazy, hot, middle-aged Mexican, but, it just didn't work out.Everything else is mostly OK here (directing, music...), so, it's agood way to let you brain to rest and have some fun.
