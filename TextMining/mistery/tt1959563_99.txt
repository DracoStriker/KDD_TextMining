I went to see this as a free preview a week before it was released totheatres. Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds make a great team.They're very funny together and they maintain that humor throughout themovie. Elodie Yung (RR's love interest) in particular was verybelievable as the put-upon ex-girlfriend. The direction andcinematography were well-done as well.I recommend this if you enjoy either of the stars' works or actionfilms in the vein of "2 Guns" or Gerard Butler's recent works.SLJ is simply on fire here. He appears to be having a wonderful timedespite all the chaos surrounding him. RR, while not as much on fire,as such, still manages to make a great had-enough straight man whonevertheless manages to be funny when he can get a word in betweenSLJ's non-stop one-liners and jokes.My only issue, which is not a complaint, is that, like almost all otheraction movies, it's not really believable. The premise isn't evenbelievable. The events in the movie (other than Gary Oldman's scenes -each of which he steals with seemingly impish glee) would never happenin real life.Other than that, watching this movie is a fine way to spend 2 hours.Would watch again.Oh, and watch out for the small role played by Selma Hayek. She playsan insane Mexican killer, and the scenes with her cellmate are comedygold!
