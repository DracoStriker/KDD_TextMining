You've all seen this before. Stereotypical and shallow characters,predictable plot, ever present and boring dialogue, iced withoverproduced CGI action scenes.Acting isn't half bad, nor are the costumes and visuals. All the aliensand creatures are done well, and there are tons of them. Most of themare nothing more than backdrops, which I don't mind, and none of themare explored in any great detail.The plot is as predictable as they come. From the beginning I could'vepointed out the obvious; That alien is too happy so she's gonna die,he's the bad guy, those robots are gonna kill everybody and so on. Achild could have come up with a better plot.It seems like they wanted to put everything from the comics into onemovie. The end result is a flat mess of a pancake.
