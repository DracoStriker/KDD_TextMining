I felt robbed when I finished watching this movie. It is so bad. I donot know where to start. The story line falls flat and predictable. Thevisual effects were nothing special either. Acting? Some of the lineswere unbearable to me. Such a waste of time and money. I admit that Ifell asleep in the most recent transformers, but I did not feel asangry at that time. Or maybe I have hit a limit in terms of badmovies... Seriously, people should stop making junks like this. It isdisrespectful of resources on the planet earth.
