Well, I sat through this whole awful mish-mash of halfway-decent CGI,appallingly wooden acting, and atrocious script without managing toremotely understand where the $177million dollars of production costswent.It really is hard to believe that someone had the courage to put theirname to the trite script, let alone the brass neck to take money forwriting it - and clearly that actors were less interested in putting ina worthwhile performance and more concerned with boosting their bankaccounts.The only saving grace is that the CGI "actors" stole the show from the"Big Names" but then that wasn't at all difficult. I personally hatethe "how do I get the two hours of my life back" type of movie reviewbut in this case it's the only possible comment to make about thisunmitigated mess....
