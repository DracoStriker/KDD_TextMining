David Bowie introduces the first five minutes of Valerian, and perhapsits fitting we should have the Starman himself lead us into a glimpseof what the future could hold for humans and all interstellar life.Bythe time Mr. Bowie completes his Space Oddity, we've learned that thetitular City of a Thousand Planets is the international space stationhundreds of years in the future.suddenly, a peaceful seashell world isdecimated without explanation.from there, Valerian and Laureline takeover the action as two agents in pursuit of their stolen commander, andeverything gets weird from there. Director Luc Besson is his ownstarman here, and he commands the world of Valerian with pizazz andpassion. Not everything works, as our space agents wrestle dialoguethat falls pancake flat; but the actors play well off each other andcomedic moments succeed more than fail. The ending half of the filmloses steam,except for Rihanna's literally acrobatic performance,butValerian is a bonkers crazy, geeky, and likable space opera that canonly come from someone who's imagination is truly free.
