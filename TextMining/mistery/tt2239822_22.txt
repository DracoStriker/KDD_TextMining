Let's start with the good, as alluded to by other writers the visualsare truly stunning, the start of the movie even got me interested withalien characters presented before my dazzled eyes. Sadly it tailed ofquite quickly for me.Dane DeHaan as the main protagonist, bored me to tears, his acting attimes akin to that of a plank from a timber yard lacking in any kind ofdynamism.I had taken my teenage daughter to see the movie as a summer holidaytreat and she felt the same as I did, that the movie at 2 hours 17minutes is far too long and full of dialogue that is superfluous to thecontinuation of the story.There are pockets of action that are well directed and scripted, butthe boredom that was cultivated between these scenes numbed my sensesto the extent, that I felt that I was wasting an afternoon that couldhave been used in a far more productive way.I am sure that this movie will find it's fans but at the end of the daythe DVD release will not be joining my collection.
