The weird thing is, I have a LOT of Luc movies in my movie collection.I would never buy this one. Its pure eye candy, and as eye candy goesits better than mostThe script is tediously predictable, the acting is barely serviceable,and the age of our protagonists does not really fit their MO, unlessthey went through some rejuvenation procedures, -which is not mentionedanywhereThe movie has been branded as a box office bomb, and i am very relievedover this, as it means Luc and company will be forced to turn out anoverall quality product next time aroundI'm betting Luc has such a large entourage that he cannot get honestconstructive criticism anymore, otherwise a lot of this movie wouldnever had made it on film, including the actors, dialogue, scriptThere are some very funny and unique items in the movie, but not enoughto save it from dragging down a viewer
