....but for the rest of us, it kinda sucked.Like most other reviews say, the acting was bad and the story prettythin. The characters are cheap. You get the feeling they were supposed to beclever in their banter and wit - none of which they succeed at. Thisleaves them coming off as some douchy kids from school, and so younever feel like wanting to invest in their journey at all. Badlywritten and really bad acting made it excruciating to watch at times.The story was predictable. You were never surprised at any moment, andyou knew how it would end. This I could maybe forgive if the rest of itwas great, but combined with bad characters and bad acting it justbecame a waste of time.I got through the movie by just focusing on the graphics. It lookedreally good with clever designs, but still it all had a feel of achildren's movie. 3 out of 10, would NOT watch again, but your kids will probably like it:)
