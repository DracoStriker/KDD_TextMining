Everyone's saying the special affects were good. But they weren't tome. They seemed the same as Jupiter ascending which to me were crap.And I seriously don't understand why they (those in charge in the film)would employ two 20 yr old's to look after the territories. Badcasting. Also Cara can't act, the only reason she and Rihanna were putin this film was so the studio could make some money. Because they havea large following. They didn't care so neither should you.
