I went to see it, despite what awful reviews it got in US. Andsurprisingly I loved. The effects are amazing, beyond amazing, so goodit upsets people don't appreciate it. The movie is so detailed, peoplehave worked immensely on this and you can tell. A complex Universe isdescribed in this movie, and you guys, it's amazing to grasp all thatand see what someone's imagination can do. The actors were OK too. This SF movie is amazing with all the effects! Don't judge it by it'scover!
