Please, ignore the critics ! This is a must see for all science fictionlovers. Visually stunning with a few flops here and there. The 3D inthis movie is great. There is so much detail in every scene and so muchtechnology that some times is hard to follow. There is a coupleunforgettable sequences. Don't Miss it !
