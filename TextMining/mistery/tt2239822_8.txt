The first thing you'll observe about Luc Besson's Valerian is howgorgeous it looks, how much work went into the perfect realisation ofthis world. In a time where nearly every blockbuster features tons ofCGI, Valerian stands out and highlights how cheaply the effects aredone in most of the other ones.Next, the sheer inventiveness of designers, artists, set builders,wardrobe and makeup - again, makes us painfully realise howoff-the-rack and dull most blockbusters are. Add to that Besson'squirky aesthetics and you're in a world that's nearly overpowering youwith its inventiveness, its visual splendour, and also plain fun. Imean, a movie where a Jessica Rabbit cameo doesn't feel forced or outof place, that's just unique.In my opinion, the optical fireworks were even a bit overdone, somescenes were plainly set up in a certain way to make them morespectacular but didn't really add to the story - an early on actionsequence in a half-virtual market comes to mind that would work nearlyequally well in a normal bazaar, just without some gags.As to the story-line - lovers of the books (as I am) will recognise alot of ingredients and species, and the main set-piece, a space city,is obviously taken from "L'Ambassadeurs des Ombres", but the storyitself is a new one and revolves around a planet wiped out in a warabout 30 years back, and the repercussions thereof. The "secret"someone wants to keep is not that secret to us, in fact about half anhour into the movie you already have a pretty good idea of what's goingon, the joy comes from the detours we're taking on the road to thehappy ending, not from silly plot twists.Now, the characters, Valerian and Laureline: Dane DeHaan looks tooyoung for his part from the comics (where Valerian was the moreexperienced partner, here he just has a higher degree), Cara Delevingneis perfectly cast, standing her ground with just the right amount ofsarcasm and spunk. The team dynamics were as readers know it - Valerianthe one who tends to stick to the rules and play by book whileLaureline tends to act more impulsively - but both working togetherreally well, be it as a duo or solo. There is a romance angle in themovie that was not taken from the books and feels a bit forced,thankfully it stays marginal and doesn't lessen the overall enjoyment.And cheers to the screenwriters (Besson, mostly) for not going full inwith the stakes. While there's some serious action here - people dieand some more might die if V&L didn't succeed - it's actually a rathersmallish plot, with just one single villain, and no worlds or even theuniverse to be saved, just the lives of some innocent bystanders.Big recommendation for all fans of colourful SciFi and opticalfireworks!
