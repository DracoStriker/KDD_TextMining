I'm a fan of Sci-Fi and Besson so I really wanted to like this movieand some parts I did. The CGI and visuals are amazing, the differentalien races, planets, spaceships etc are done to perfection, you canreally immerse yourself in scenery and at times even the story butunfortunately the casting is borderline crazy, I cannot understand whatthey were thinking when they chose certain actors for certain roles.Their acting isn't bad but man do they not fit their roles. Dan DeHaanwho plays the protagonist and military tough guy Valerian just makessome scenes funny when they are intended to be serious and tough, hisacting isn't bad but he simply doesn't fit the role of a hardenedmilitary and neither does Cara Delevingne who plays his militaryside-kick. It's like casting Paul Reubens (Pe Wee Herman) as Rambo andtrying to be serious. The casting makes it so hard to like this movie,simply because they don't fit their roles one bit. Was this an attemptto appeal to a younger audience? No idea but it didn't work for me onebit.I'm giving this 5 stars only for the perfect visuals if it wasn't forthem I would have given a even lower score. Sadly I have to say thatthis is Luc Besson's worst movie so far.
