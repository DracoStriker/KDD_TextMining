I saw this film a couple times because I was really tired the firsttime and dozed off numerous times to the point that the plot-line wasmuddled. After seeing the film in a conscious state I have to say thatthis was an awesome film. Not familiar at all with the graphicnovel/comic but the choice of actors was no less than impressive. I'veliked DeHaan as an actor since his earlier work as tortured JesseD'Amato on HBO's "In Treatment". Never noticed until this movie,however, how much DeHaan sounds like Keanu Reeves doing his best TedTheodore Logan from San Dimas' supergroup Wyld Stallions. Not sure ifthat voice was an affectation specifically for this film, or that Ijust hadn't made the connection before. At times I caught myselflaughing inappropriately as I waited for him to do Logan's signatureair guitar riff from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.
