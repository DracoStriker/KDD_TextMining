This movie is actually a lot of fun, visually stunning, it's just soartful and beautiful. The story is pretty good too. It's sooo muchbetter than both Episode VII and Wonder woman, yet such a lowerscore... I guess a movie has to be idiotic to get above a 7 on IMDbthese days... It would have worked better with two older maincharacters. They seem too young and childish for their roles. They seema little out of place, at least the guy, the girl does a better jobthan him, but it's not so much their fault as it's that of whomeverwrote the script, which at times is pretty bad, especially when theytalk to each other. Otherwise the movie is very good, feels fresh andwas a pleasant surprise in the massive mass of garbage films that arecoming out of Hollywood these days...
