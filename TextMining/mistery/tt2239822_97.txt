I went into this movie expecting to see a lot of different alieninteractions with a bunch of action and adventure and it didn'tdisappoint. However there are some things that should've been donebetter, like for example in the entire movie it seems like Valerian isa love struck child after Laureline. Now I understand he wanted that inthe movie, but making every other scene him whining about it wasn't agood way to go. Also for a movie that has amazing visuals and greatacting they have a very substandard dialogue, it seems like it waswritten by someone who didn't fully understand what they were going forand instead of making it playful and teasing they made it whiny andchildish. Now onto the actual movie, without going too far into the story, therewas an alien race, something bad happen to their planet, years laterwhile on a mission Valerian and Laureline stumble into part of thestory and uncover the rest of it. There is a good amount of gun play,and some fighting, all and all it's pretty good, had they gotten abetter dialog writer it would have been a 10, but as it stands it'sabout a 8/10.
