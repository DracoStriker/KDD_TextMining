Extremely enjoyable film. Yes, the dialog was a tad clunky, and the acting was a bit over-the-top- but I felt it added to the fun/cheese factor. Just understand thatit's a French/International film that is going to be translated intodozens of languages. It was a well crafted film, the effects were great (loved the Pearls),and the story was very easy to follow and well-structured whileremaining interesting and fast-paced throughout. Definitely recommend, but I can't give it a 10 due to fact that thechemistry was a bit off between the leads, however I did enjoy thecampy quality of their relationship.
