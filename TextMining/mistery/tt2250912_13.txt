Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character andcharm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doingdisservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Manfranchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its greatcast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performancefrom Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfieldbrought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences andsimilarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crimefighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lackof great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as,if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is greatadversary physically but also psychologically and we see this withMichael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man:Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and worldbuilding put into the town of Queens, which feels more real andbelievable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU,making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the MarvelCinematic Universe and another great example for future superheromovies to learn from.
