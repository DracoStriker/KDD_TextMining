You will enjoy every single minute of this movie, Tom Holland isdefinitely the best peter Parker and Spider-Man we have ever seen.Marvel studios really did deliver with this one great action, humor,comedy, and much more. The villain in this movie who is the vulture isprobably the best marvel movie villain ever, Michael Keaton gives hisbest portrayal of the role. This is not a iron man movie this is astraight Spider-Man movie that tells us his life before and after civilwar and it all sums up very good.
