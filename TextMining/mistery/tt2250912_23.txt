Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of PeterParker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of CaptainAmerica: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & hiscrime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/IronMan(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Manfaces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(MichaelKeaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it'stoo late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider-Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees adifferent side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previousbig screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that thefocus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. Theaction set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, theStaten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film.The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love thefact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from thecomics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. Thebackground score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after thefilm ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland isthe star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portraysPeter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit &flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding asAdrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all sixstandalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal ofGreen Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as TonyStark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau issuperb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon isfantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz.
