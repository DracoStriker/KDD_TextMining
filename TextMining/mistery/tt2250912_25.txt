OK, I have never left a review for a movie, but this had to be done.This is, hands down, the best Spider-man movie ever. So grounded,minimum cliché moments(only one, and I'm not sure how much cliché itreally is...). Best casting, amazing acting, great villain, greatstory, amazing conclusions to small-movie-stories... Must watch even ifyou're not a Marvel fan...
