Our take: See it in theaters. The extra $2 for a 3-D showing will notbe a waste. Post credit scene? Yes, two, so just wait until that lastSony logo appears to get up and leave.You would hope that when they do a reboot every three years they'dlearn something. And they did. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a fun, fresh,and fast-paced installation and the movie we've been waiting years for.Forget the doom and gloom, forgot convoluted side plots, forget Oscorpand the Bugle, forget the awkward emo dance moves ? this movieeliminated it all and tucked the canon neatly into the MCU instead.Somehow, it was even able to give the newly introduced villain,Vulture, a grounded backstory in the universe. After his backdoor-pilot mission in Civil War, Holland finally gives us a coming-of-age,high school Peter Parker story instead of just handing us an amazingSpider-Man. With very little exposition necessary (sorry Uncle Ben, butwe've seen you die, A LOT) the movie was allowed to explore thecharacter and struggles that Peter Parker has in both high school andas a hero, in ways the other films failed to (Incredibly, movies abouthigh schoolers are so much better when you cast younger actors insteadof British men in their 30s that you have to get out of high ASAPbecause the aging process doesn't stop.) Added to the mix are asidekick (Ned played by Jacob Batalon) that often steals the show a lotof sidekick comedy, a stupid high school crush (Liz played by LauraHarrier), and an MCU caliber villain creating an instant hit for allages. Even with the occasional plot or character stumble, the film wasable to deliver an amusing and entertaining look at the new Spider-Manfranchise. But The film leaves you with a familiar feeling, and yet, italso feels completely new ? it's an increasingly delightful dichotomyand direction for these films to be heading in.
