Amazing reboot, different theme from your typical superhero as per allMarvel Studio films so far. The theme for this one is grounded, street-level and teen oriented; andwonderfully executed.The acting is superb from the cast, but Michael Keaton is the gift thatkeeps on giving. His presence and facial expressions stole the scenesas per his acting signature. Marissa Tomei was a delight and so werethe young high school cast. Robert Downey Jr was as per his usual self,he didn't hog the scenes but he complimented Tom Holland very nicely intheir scenes.In regards to the link to the other MCU films, well it was there but itwasn't over bearing, this film felt very separate and individual butwith the rest of the other films lingering in the background with theirimpact to the universe.I would say this film is EQUAL to Wonder Woman as far as superherofilms this year goes. Both are amazing and well executed.Who said Super hero films are getting stale?
