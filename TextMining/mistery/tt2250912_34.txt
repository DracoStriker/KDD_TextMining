Honestly, when the movie was announced I really did think that thiswould've ruined the classic Spiderman franchise, seems that I waswrong. This is an absolutely 'amazing' movie, best Spiderman movie yet!Although actors have changed, this time the Avengers recognise thisyoung man as a hero and they also add a story to it, the classicSpiderman trying to stop the train with the tensile strength of hiswebs was recreated in the movie and many of the original features wereretained. There is also a very funny sense of humour (personally) and Ihonestly found it hilarious. They could not choose anyone better thanNed as Spidey's best friend and I would rate this movie an excellent9.6 out of 10!
