Spider-Man: Homecoming First things first. Sadly no Pop pop of UncleBen in this Reboot. I know I'm gonna enjoy this movie, but I neverthought it to be this good. This is not a typical superhero flick. Thiscan be viewed as a great superhero movie for MCU or can also be viewedas a silly teen script, either way it is awesome. Avengers were the #1Movie for me in MCU but this easily is on par with them. RDJ ispractically Tom's surrogate dad. He is more than a mentor. I'd reallywant to see a full length movie of Ironman and Spider- Man. At last,MCU always lagged of a worthy villain (Except Loki and a few ), Toomesis already in the top 5 big bad's of MCU. This is not overstating, heis the best villain since Loki. Vulture took the whole movie to otherlevel. This is the definition of a Fun movie. The definition of how MCUis successful in their Genre. And The Ending is the best we got of allthe Spider-Man movies if not of all the MCU. The whole theater burstoff for the Last part. Do stay for End Credits. Worth waiting. 9/10,Worth every penny.
