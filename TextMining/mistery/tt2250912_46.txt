This movie was totally off the hook. The storyline was amazing. It wascompletely hilarious and full of action at the same time. The graphicsand choreography were both awesome. I enjoyed every moment of it. Lovethe new Spider-man suit. Robert Downey Jr/Iron Man was spectacular ofcourse. Love his mentorship towards Spidey. Michael Keaton made afantastic villain. I would recommend lots of people to view and savourthis classical blockbuster masterpiece. This movie deserves 5/5 stars.Kudos!!!
