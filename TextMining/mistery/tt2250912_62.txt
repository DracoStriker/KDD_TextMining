First of all, I could not recognize Michael Keaton as Adrian duringviewing this film. Actually I surprised everybody is getting oldwithout clear notice... American comic style differs from Japanese one. And I'm quite familiarwith Hayao Miyazaki's animations. Although I have allergy to seeAmerican comic films, I really love this one! This is kind of story that a super hero who is hiding his true identityand mission lives normally student life. Only an incident happens, hebecomes a hero to deal with villains. And villains are searching hiswhereabouts for revenge. A kind of student version of Bat man. The most interesting plot is Peter's girl friend's father is theantagonist, Adrian! The action line and emotional line of story areperfectly combined into one at the end of Act 2. The result of the battle is Peter=Spiderman wins over the antagonist.And the filmmaker did not have Adrian survive. I think it is too realistic, and everyone wants Adrian do not die as afather of Pete's girl friend. Anyway, the entire expression of film art is perfect! 10 out of 10!
