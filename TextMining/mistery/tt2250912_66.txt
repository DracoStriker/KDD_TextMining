The movie S-U-C-K-S. Not exaggerating one bit. Everything feels sogeneric, CGI is so bad it almost feels like watching video gamecut-scenes during the action sequences, there is nothing really goingon despite the fact that Peter wants to convince Tony that he is worthyto be an Avenger (childish all the way- what a hero!). Emotionallyempty movie with silly jokes and Easter eggs, bad- indifferentcinematography, bad performances from everyone (Holland is NOT PeterParker, Keaton did his Beatlejuice mannerisms once again, Marisa Tomeicute as always but miscast, the rest of the cast either underdevelopedor amateur at best). This movie is just suits and tech. I could go onbashing it forever not only for not being loyal to Spiderman comics butalso for being more of a TV show rather than a movie. Forgot to mentionthat there is a lot of stupidity throughout the movie for instance nophysics in there (plus more but I'd have to go frame by frame todiscuss those). Never before in my life have I been so baffled from the critics' andaudience's consensus. 93% on rotten tomatoes??? WTF! We deserve junklike that then. Since you like talking movie morals why don't you alltake a minute to think about this: If the cinema is going downhillmaybe YOU are responsible too (since you like garbage like SpidermanHomecoming)
