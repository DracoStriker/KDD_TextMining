This is not your father's Spiderman, nor your father's Peter Parker.This is not Stan Lee's or Steve Ditko's Spiderman either, although Standoes make his expected cameo... and I expect will be cashing a fatroyalty check any day now. And this sure as hell is not anyone's Aunt May. (Can I just say howgreat it is to see Marisa Tomei, whom I have always had a crush on...but not as Aunt May. Come on already.)I cannot accept a Peter Parker who is not capable of making his ownsuit. I cannot accept a Peter Parker who is so in awe of any othersuper hero as this one is in awe of Tony Stark. I cannot accept a PeterParker who has a pudgy side kick. No Jonah Jameson? No Daily Bugle?Why did Marvel Studios feel like it had to remake so many of the basicelements of Peter's story? The Lee/Ditko creation was prettysuccessful, don't you think?Yes, the screenplay otherwise was well written. Yes, Tom Holland playsan excellent Peter/Spidey. Yes, Michael Keaton was great as theVulture. And the effects were as they should be. So I give four starsout of ten for the four things that were right about this picture. Too many things wrong with the overall vision of Marvel Studio'sSpiderman. Sony and Sam Raimi got it right, especially in the secondfilm with Doc Ock. Now THAT was the Peter/Spidey Stan and Stevecreated. How could Marvel Studios fail so badly with Marvel Comics' number oneproperty?
