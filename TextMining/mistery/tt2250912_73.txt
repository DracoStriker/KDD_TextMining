I gave 10 out of 10 because I saw the rating was 'only' 7.9, and Ithink Spiderman:Homecoming deserves more.I am not trying to compare this version to its predecessors. It'ssimple: If you want to know how a teenage Peter Parker feels the firsttime he thinks he could actually be a 'real' superhero figure, you mustwatch this movie.Being an Avenger is definitely every good-hearted-teen-with-superpowerswants to be!And Peter is indeed a teenager the first time he gets his superpowers:dealing with school, crush, friends, parents, ego, beliefs..So this movie's just a proper portrayal of what he should be doing. P.S.: This movie's so fun!
