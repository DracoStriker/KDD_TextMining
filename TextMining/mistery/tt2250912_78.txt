I'd have given this film a rating no stars had it have let me. A lot ofthe reviews on here have said that this film is only enjoyable for 12year olds. Well, as the mother of a nearly 10 year old who heroworships Spiderman and has done for most of his life, he certainlydidn't find this enjoyable. He is annoyed at how feeble they have madeSpider-Man in this film. A few minutes into the film, I asked myhusband if this was a parody, and unfortunately it just got worse.
