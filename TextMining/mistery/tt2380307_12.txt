I was very skeptical at first, as a Mexican I was afraid they'll usethe stereotypes and put us in a box, but by the end of the movie I feltmore Mexican than ever. Coco exploits one of the most important Mexican traditions in a veryrespectful way, it shows what Día de Muertos it's all about, the onenight a year where we can reunite with our beloved ones that are nolonger here. Pixar-Disney jumps out of the box, once again, and leave all theprincess and fairy stories to show us the importance of family andtraditions in a unique funny and colorful story. All the characters areright on point, they grow together learning from each other making itone of the most emotional and pleasing movie I've seen in a long time. A movie that will make you laugh and cry, Coco might be a movie forchildren but a guarantee everyone will just love it. Bravo!
