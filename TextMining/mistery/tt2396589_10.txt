I don't know how to feel about this. There's so much to admire, thebiggest being its cast. It's some great work by an incredibly talentedcast, with Jason Mitchell and Garrett Hedlund being the best in show.They both deliver some truly fantastic work. The biggest shame is thatthe film is quite messy. It tries to juggle so much, or maybe in theoryit could have worked, but it's brought down so many times by somereally questionable directorial choices. The film's music is sometimesoverused, the editing jumpy and sometimes prevents you from getting tooinvested, and the cinematography quite messy. Technically, the film isincredibly flawed. It seems to lack a real sense of rhythm andconsistent pacing the more it goes on, even if weirdly the characterstory lines also become a lot more investing. The main plot summary orpremise of the film, or what all sites had it as being, doesn't reallykick into gear until the second half, which makes the thing even moreconfusing. However, the different perspectives through which the filmis shown was a great artistic choice (definitely gotten from the novel,and sometimes it does feel very rushed as well). Overall, I'm going tohave to sit a bit on this one. I want to like it a lot, but as it isit's a big ol' mess. The final scenes also seem to come out of nowhere,as if the film was in a hurry to end.
