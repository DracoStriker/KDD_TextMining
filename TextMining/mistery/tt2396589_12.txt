I felt the film dragged in the first hour, but once the two boys cameback from WWII, one from a white family and the other from a blackfamily, the story was rolling. Very sick how young men who served inthe war had to return to disgusting racism. A whole new fresh horrorawaited them. After the ending, I felt I needed to watch MississippiBurning just to get a feeling of justice. What a lawless hole the southwas. After seeing all the black children murdered in recent years, RoyMoore's base comments in Alabama, and juvenile actions of Trump, I askmyself where is the leadership in America to finally address the overincarceration of black men, lax gun laws, police brutality, whiteprivilege in the justice system, etc?? This film did not leave me with a sense of hope. After WWII, many blackmen moved to Europe where they were treated as equals. I realize theMudbound story takes place in 1940s but do people actually thinkAmerica is the land of the free today? I don't think so. And seeingAmericans vote someone like Trump into power only makes those of us onthe outside wonder ... what is the fate of this country? .
