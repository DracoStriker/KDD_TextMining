An engrossing tale filled with tragedy and hope, "Mudbound" takes usback to the mid-1940s Mississippi, where two families (one white, oneblack) struggle to make a living at farm work. The black family is at adisadvantage because they are poor; and the color of their skinautomatically makes them targets for many angry, prejudiced, whitemales of the South. But hope blossoms everywhere, and it comes in theform of two men who come back to Mississippi after World War II isover.Jason Mitchell plays one of the sons of the black farming family; andGarrett Hedlund plays the brother of the white, farming familypatriarch. Both have seen the grotesque nature of combat, and both haveexperienced a bigger part of the world ? changes that will have thepower to bridge the huge gap between white and black, but can alsodestroy both men and their families. Customs and certain ways ofthinking of an entire region doesn't easily bend or break to the dreamsof a few people.My most memorable, movie moment of "Mudbound" is the scene when**SPOILER ALERT** Hedlund tries to rescue Mitchell from the KKK. It isa brutal, indelible part of the story that begs the question "Wheredoes all this hate come from?""Mudbound" takes its time to tell its story in the first act, layingthe groundwork for what is to come next. Many scenes are somewhatGothic in nature; and the transitions from one scene to the next cansometimes be jarring and may be construed as incompetent editing bythose who are not paying attention. But to those who give this movietheir complete attention, they will see the subtle connections, andappreciate the power in the quieter moments.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments
