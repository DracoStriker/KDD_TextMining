I can't remember the last time I watched a film that was so touching.Especially set more than a half century ago, The acting isexceptionally great. The narrative is as smooth as molasses. But whatreally caught in my soul was that some of these racial prejudices stillexist.I was fortunate to have grown up in Canada in the 1950s. My Dad startedhis dental practice with a Japanese partner. Most of his patients wereNative or Metis, who would, often as nought, pay him with chickens or aside of venison.As I said, this story was relaetable to me, not because I share thecenturies of oppression suffered by many many millions of AfricanAmericans, But because I am a Jew. And in the decade that came afterWWII, was, practically, in a small town.There is hate out there always THOSE WHO HATE ARE INSECURE.In my opinion, this film is so important to where we were and wherewe've arrived, that it should have been given wider distribution beyondNetflix/s web. This story and its' storytellers should have beenpicked-up by a major studio.Still, well done to all the tellers and actors - You have made mymonth! (maybe my year) I'd bet you'll never be the same for having thechance to perform these roles.Bravo!
