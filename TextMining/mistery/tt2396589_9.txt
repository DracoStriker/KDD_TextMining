This is the kind of film where each character gets enough space andeach of the actors gives such astonishing performance that you can'tjust choose who was the best among them. Carey Mulligan, GarrettHedlund and Jason Mitchell lead the film where Mulligan is proving hercaliber once again and the latter two shows they can carry a film ontheir own. Showing racism through a white housewife who never has knowntrue freedom and 2 IInd World War soldiers one black and one white whoreturns to their farm after the war, soaked in blood and mud havecreated one of the best films of the year. Jason Clarke's characteressentially represents how racism can be passed through generationswithout being outright violent about it and how a lot of people needsto be so cautious about their every single action just to simply livepeacefully. Even though depicting a bygone era it was relatable on somany levels. The best film of the year so far for me.
