I'm not averse to watching attractive people grind their naked bodiestogether or punch, shoot and stab each other. But when a movie hasnothing else to offer besides a selection of 1980s pop hits andwashed-out shots of a largely fictional Berlin, I tend to get bored.And boy, did this contrived McGuffin chase bore me to death. Thepaper-thin plot only exists to somehow string the various stunt, fight,sex and car chase scenes together. The fact that many of the positivereviews laud Charlize Theron's physical appearance and gush about thelesbian sex scene shows how utterly forgettable the entire rest of thismovie is. I mostly give it 3 stars for the musical score, even though Icould have listened to an '80s mixtape for free.
