The problem with this movie is the protagonist. She was 100%irritating. I was rooting for the bad guys in this one like neverbefore. Most of the irritation stems from her moronic whispery voice.If this was supposed to be a sexy femme fatale imitation it failed, itwas the opposite of charming, it was excruciating. Trying to give outthe cool vibe with the smoking and vodka made it worse, though thatwould be down to the director. The second most annoying thing about thepic were the fight scenes, the most ridiculous scenes in any movie,including spoofs. The men in this movie were the worst skirmishersimaginable. A ten year old with a gun could defeat this woman. Justpoint and shoot. And as for hand-to-hand combat with trainedprofessional combatants, she would have zero chance. Zero. She wouldhave zero chance in a pub brawl. That's the weak-woman-defeats-hard-menfeminist fantasy that always pisses me off when I see it on screen. The3 points awarded are 2 for the setting, and oen for the villain, whosscenes were by far the best in the movie, though his death scene wasridiculous. I miss the 80's when they made action movies written formen, rather than in-your-face PC fantasists and propagandists.Seriously, in the real world the actress wouldn't have lasted 5 minutesagainst Eastern European and Russian agents, nor the villain come tothat. An so the movie was doomed from the start. I don't mindsuspending disbelief, but when it comes to ladies beating upprofessional combatants, forget it, your movie sucks.
