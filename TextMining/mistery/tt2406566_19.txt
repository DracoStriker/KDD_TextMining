Agent goes to Berlin to retrieve the body of a fallen partner only toget more than she bargained for.Packed with double cross and John Wick-style action, David LeitchAtomic Blonde is weak in comparison, it was a promising 80s set ColdWar espionage female driven film in the vein of Salt but it's a case ofstyle over substance, a waste of good actors including Charlize Theronchannelling Blondie (Debora Harry) as undercover MI6 agent LorraineBroughton with a shoe horned soundtrack of the period. It was sold to be a gender-less lead, you could have put ArnoldSchwarzenegger in the role in press interviews but nothing was furtherfrom the truth, with it focusing female exploitation from the start.Wasted of all round talent including Leitch in a forgettable messyfilm.
