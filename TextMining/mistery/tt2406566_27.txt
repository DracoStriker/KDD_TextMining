After dazzling everyone with his debut feature, which he co-directedwith Chad Stahelski, director David Leitch tries to prove his mettlewith his solo directorial effort but unlike Stahelski's solo feat thatwas John Wick: Chapter 2, his film falls a little short. There are fewthings that Atomic Blonde gets right but it isn't sturdy enough to holditself together.Set in Germany just before the fall of Berlin Wall, the story of AtomicBlonde follows a top-level MI6 field agent who's sent to Berlin toinvestigate the murder of a fellow undercover agent and retrieve anall-important list that would expose every intelligence agent active onboth sides of the wall but in order to deliver the package safelyacross the wall, she has to bring all her skill-set into play.Directed by David Leitch, the film finds him in prime form when he'sstaging an action sequence but whenever it returns to plot & characterdevelopment, it's unable to sustain that same level of intensity. Thenarrative is weak, the non-linear arrangement is incoherent, subplotsare poorly scripted, twists are predictable & it lacks a smooth flowwhen switching from one scene to another.The Cold War era and the feeling of unrest that comes associated withit is expertly captured and well-sustained by its overcast ambiance &apt use of cold colour tones. Camera-work is kinetic and makesexcellent use of close-ups, long takes & neon lighting to add moreflavours to its images. Editing is all over the place though, for theplot is muddled, narrative flow is inconsistent & pacing is tedious.Coming to the performances, leading from the front is Charlize Theronin a swashbuckling display of swag, sultriness & solidity, and shecaptures her character's cold & charismatic demeanour with rawintensity. James McAvoy's character carries an enigmatic quality andthe actor does justice to his role. And the two are finely supported byJohn Goodman, Sofia Boutella, Bill Skarsgård & Toby Jones.On an overall scale, Atomic Blonde is a stylishly directed action spythriller but the blandness in the storytelling section fails to set itapart from its genre's norms. The action is brutal, thrilling & highlyengaging, and I love the fact that those hand-to-hand combat scenes areillustrated as physically exhausting, which is what they are inreal-life. In short, Atomic Blonde rides on Theron's badass input andentertains in bits n pieces but the interest always fizzles out whenshe isn't beating men to a pulp.
