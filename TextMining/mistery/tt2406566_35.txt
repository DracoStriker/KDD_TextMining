The film 'looks good' in a way few others do. That is not meant as acompliment, it felt as though the aesthetic was the ONLY thing thefilm's creators cared about.. even the soundtrack became irksome as onecool track after another was put in, for no apparent reason other thanto keeeeep saying 'how 'COOL' are we?'. The lesbian sex scene.. Ugh!Like everything else; so contrived, so choreographed and so self-aware. This film will likely best be enjoyed by the vapid, shallow generationwho care about image and nothing else, or those who like end-to-endfight scenes without any story-line or character development to makethem interesting. I should also like to add it feels like the alcohol and tobbaccoindustry financed a lot of this movie, as the smoking and drinkingfollows the same 'cool' line and is as ever-present as the fightscenes.Looked good, bored the pants off me. One hopes this isn't the directionfilm-making is going.
