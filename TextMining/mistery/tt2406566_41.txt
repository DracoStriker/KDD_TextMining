I do not believe Charlize Theron should be making these kinds ofmovies, she's an outdated actress and She's old and does not belong inthis type of fast Action movie. The role she plays is not convincing atall and This movie is a joke. Her best role was when she played a fatugly Old alcoholic. That was believable, This movie is not unbelievableat all And I have not wasted nor will I waste any Money on this film.Saw it for free at a friends house and stopped the movie 10 minutes in,all of my friends felt the same, men and women. This is a joke of amovie!
