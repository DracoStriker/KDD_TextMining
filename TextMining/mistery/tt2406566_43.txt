This could have turned out as an interesting counterpart to the JamesBond movies, even though I am becoming increasingly doubtful if graphicnovels are suitable material to base a movie on. This movie has somerich visuals, but most of that is martial arts. More like a Jackie Chanfilm. Charlize Theron plays the secret service hitwoman well, butsomehow, she stays in her bubble. In the Bond movies, there is someironic undertone that makes the movies unique and occasionally worthwatching. In the Jason Bourne series, the main character took thespectator by the hand and through the movies. I miss this herecompletely. Lorraine Broughton appears more like a terminator robot.There is no emotional vulnerability in the character, or Theron playsthe character that way, resulting in an uninteresting figure. The plotis not really clear and does not work up to a climax. The drama aboutthe list seems of secondary importance in the end. Too many fist fightsso you tend to get confused what the characters are struggling for. Andthat after Lorraine has taken out half of the KGB thugs in Berlinsingle-handed. Great realism. Altogether, I must say I wasdisappointed. This could have been good, but it is the same old teasewe always get to see. Some nice wrapping but the satchel feels empty.Nothing rattling inside.
