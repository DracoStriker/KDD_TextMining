I watched this movie not because its appealing title, but because ofhaving Charlize in the main role. I'm a fan of her and I'm not ashamed!The expectations were not too big, I must honestly say, although thecast is pretty interesting but I had a big surprise! I really enjoyedthis movie, from the beginning to the end! Full of very good andcredible action, impressive and realistic fighting scenes, a sexyCharlize, good actors and good acting and not to mention surprises tillthe very and! I mus say, this is the second very good action movie seen by me thisyear! I gave it a solid 8, is a very big note for me!
