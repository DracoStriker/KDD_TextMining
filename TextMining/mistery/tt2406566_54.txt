The film felt like Charlie did not want to be there and she didn't seeminto playing the character and was just going through the motions for apaycheck.The other characters and actors also felt a bit off in the film and thedialogue was not spectacular.It just felt like an 80's biker chick slash Becky party girl film for alot of it.I honestly struggled to watch most of the film and then it picks up inthe 3rd act for the umbrella staircase scene.So I give it a 5 out of 5 as it was mediocre for most of it and that isthat.Some of the characters did not make sense because she supposedly drinksa lot but never gets hungover or hammered, which is ridiculous ha-ha.She literally slams a whole bottle of vodka with no drunk reactionha-ha...like give me a break ha-ha.Some of the fighting wasn't believable and it felt like the guys werepurposely flopping and you could tell her strikes lacked power,although her judo throws were looking technically sound...only in thethird act was the fighting more believable but she was very monotone indelivery at times like you just ate a lot of shots, that would hurt,yet no reaction.The espionage list concept has been used in various films but I likeJet Li in Fong Sai Yuk 2 better than this I feel Charlie wasn't intothe script and it shows but the media got payed to hype the hell out ofthe film ha-ha.
