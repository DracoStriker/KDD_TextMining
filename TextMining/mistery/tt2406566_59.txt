I feel this movie is more of a old school movie that delivers when youhave done your own work. Yes it's a action/spy movie with a lot ofaction but the set up of the movie is a slow burn. I think many don'trealize what a great movie this is. Especially when you compare it toother modern action movies. Charlize is a truly great actor and I lovethe fact that she kicks the crap out of the men in the movie. And alsothat she don't need a man neither sexually or otherwise. It also has amessage that secrets can destroy but also that the world is built onsecret and lies. And in the end you have to remember who you are or youwill forget your path.
