Atomic Blonde is a great action movie from the beginning to the end.Ireally loved it.The thing I hate about this movie is the unnecessarybad language.Delicious woman Charlieze Theron is is a British agent MI6 sent to adivided Berlin on a secret mission to track enemies and spies. She issurrounded by hostile opponents everywhere she goes. She is the WonderWoman or the Super woman who is so capable of fighting every aggressiveand evil person,thanks to her profession in combat fighting.The Lesbian Sex Scenes were short,but hot indeed for Lesbians to enjoy.The Fighting Scenes Are Amazing.I advise all adults and especially Lesbians to see this magnificentmovie.
