The director who previously helmed John Wick does a good job ofcreating Eye popping visuals and guiding Charlize Theron (who put a lotof effort into the stunts) through her kickass character but unlikeJohn Wick,this movie suffers from a lackluster script and halfwaythrough I found myself not caring about the characters and the plot
