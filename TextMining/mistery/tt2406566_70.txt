Atomic Blonde is a simple concept with a powerful idea aim to empowerthe female role within the action/spy genre, basically making JamesBond into a girl. But the horrendous plot and dumb characters insteadhave the opposite effect, making anyone who saw it extremely opposed toa female Bond character. Although Charlize Theron, James McAvoy, andJohn Goodman tried their best with what they had, their characterslacked the depth they were able to portray in their earlier films,which was not helped by the fact that other characters were so boring Iforgot about them as soon as their specific scene ended. The plot isone of those stupidly-simple-but-told-in-a-complex-way-to-appear-cool.The lesbian scene came from nowhere, the relationship was undefined andundeveloped and its really disturbing that its the scene most criticsfocus on... ?? The fight scenes are good and there are some funnymoments, but its basically a John Wick imitation with no specificsubstance of its own. Its not a terrible movie, just GREATLY reduceyour expectations and forget that it stars 2 amazing actors who gave usfilms like Mad Max and Split.
