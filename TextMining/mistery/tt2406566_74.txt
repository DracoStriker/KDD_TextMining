I actually looked forward to this movie for a while! The trailers mademe believe that this would be an exciting movie. This wasn't the casethough!Throughout the film I wondered: is anything ever going to happen? It'sso boring?! I turned it off after an hour because no, nothing everhappens. What I think of it:- There is no character development, we're just introduced to thecharacters and we're not getting to know them. - Storyline sucks. Nothing exciting happens, it's really boring andmakes you wonder if anything will ever happen. - I love the type of music they used in this film, but they used it waytoo much, this was an overkill. Made it seem like they thought: 'we'rejust gonna make a movie with a lot of old cool songs, and then we'lljust build some story around it.' - Desperately TRYING to be cool: this movie wanted to be cool so bad.They wanted it too much which made it painful and annoying to watch. - Normally I think Charlize Theron is a good actress, but in this movieit looked like it was her first time acting or something. She has oneface during the whole movie. I get that her character is a hard andcold woman, but the way she performed, it was too much which made itpretty fake. - Toooooo much smoking and drinking, again: desperately trying to lookcool...You can't call this a movie, it's just cool music with a really lamestoryline written around it.. LAME!
