If you want to spend half the movie looking at closeups of CharliseTheron's face, this is the film for you. Most of the rest of the filmshows you her walking around London, walking about Berlin, walkingaround the airport, walking up the gang plank, etc. Every so often, butrarely, there is an action sequence that looks pretty staged. If thisisn't enough to warn you away, the music is so loud it's a constantirritant.
