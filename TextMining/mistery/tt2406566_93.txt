This movie tries so hard to be cool but fails miserably. Neon colors,80's pop music sound track, lesbian sex scenes... can't make up for anuninteresting story, uninteresting characters, uninteresting dialogue.Charlize Theron lacks charisma as usual and it's quite obvious she cantfight. Not even Tarantino could have made this into a good movie.
