Seriously, I am nostalgia'd out. With Stranger Things 1 & 2 and 2017'sIt, I've kinda had my fill for now. Had this come out 10 years ago,okay then.Late in this movie, there's a one-shot, fight scene that saves some ofthis boring mess. Other than that, the trailers ruined this movie.Normally, I don't rate a movie on its box-office success or failure.But, basically this movie bombed and it was probably due to falseadvertising. It surely promoted non-stop action, kick-ass Charlize andintrigue. This had none of that.After the Fast and Furious (which one? Part 29?) movie that featuredthe lovely Charlize Theron, I had HIGH HOPES for this kickass femaleBourne movie and instead got an incredibly slow, downplayed anduninteresting retro film that never lived up to the hype.And boy, the music. Distracting. Again, release this a decade ago andwow, those 80s tunes would've really have an impact. Instead, itthoroughly distracted from one great action scene featured in thepreviews. The movie is incessantly deliberate and Charlize underused. I reallywanted to see her fight, win and move the plot. Instead, she's movingfrom scene to scene to discover a list of spies. Oh, and not so subtleby the way: one's even named "Spyglass." Really?Worse, this movie is told in flashbacks and narration when it would'vebenefited by just being told in straightforward storytelling.Charlize is absolutely badass. Internally and externally. But, she'snot getting any younger. Stop wasting her talents with boring films.Despite one long and admittedly fantastic fight scene in the latterpart of the second act, this movie is an absolute skip. ***Final thoughts: Literally, just watch Spielberg's Bridge of Spies oreven Munich. Both resemble this movie without the quick outbursts offemale kickassery. Only, as slow-moving those spy films were, they atleast were interesting and well shot.
