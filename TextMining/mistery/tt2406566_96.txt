Well, as many other wrote, the film wasn't a masterpiece of scenario.In fact, it was like a nice little pulp novel we could all easily writein a weekend.So, concerning plot/scenario, no more than 3 stars.About the 80s nostalgia... oh boy... how I've missed these years backthen (I'm 48 years old). I LOVED that part, period! Therefore, musicscores 8-9 stars!Action? Marvelous, no doubt. I loved it. Looks like I was watchingJason Born film but with female hero! So, 7-8 stars for the action....And Charlize...? Oh boy. SHE GIVES THE MEANING to the word "FEMALE"!She's the meaning of this word. Even if there are million girls withhalf of her age, Theron... simply makes a man to cut his wrists becausehe's not her!!! Super gorgeous Theron, period. (And I'm not talkingabout the homosexual scene with the brunette girl. Nope. Simplywatching her walking, close up to her marvelous Southafrican greeneyes... you drinking the Savana through her look).Thus, the film is a 6 stars to me. If it had SERIOUS scenario, we'lltalking about a new Jason Born female era.
