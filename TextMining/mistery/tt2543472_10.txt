Fantastic movie. I just got home from taking my family to see it. Agreat lesson in the realization that you are what's inside and not whatyou look like. (Kardashians could take a lesson). Once again, MandyPatinkin stole the show. But this was also the best thing I've everseen Owen Wilson in. It's a great lesson we can all take heart in.There were more than a few sniffles.
