This is a truly inspiring film, the gripping and saddening story ofAuggie (Jacob Tremblay) engages the audience and makes you think howyou judge people yourself, take a minute if you saw Auggie what wouldyour initial thoughts be? The film switches between key characters,obviously Auggie, Via (Izabela Vidovic), Jack Will (Noah Jupe), Miranda(Danielle Rose Russell), by showing each key characters background ittakes the lime light away from Auggie, not to take anything away fromhim but the whole film revolves around him as he features in everyone'sbackstory and own story, the back stories of each character shows thepersonal trials they are going through, while they are sometimes sharedoutside of the back story Auggie manages to link everything back tohimself, when it is not always because or due to him as Via says: 'noteverything's about you Auggie' Via is the caring, protective,understating sister and daughter she is like Auggies guardian outsidethe comfort of his own house, when Auggie links one of Via's problemsback to himself she snaps and says that not everything is about him,this causes Auggie to go into self pitying himself and trying toconvince Via that only bad things happen to him, while in his mind thisis true because he was home-schooled up until middle school he doesn'tknow any better, Via diffuses the situations and makes amend by takingAuggie trick or treating as it his favourite thing to do other thanScience in which he is a mini Einstein. The moving story of Auggie andhis struggles deepens when a fancy dress day a school for Halloweendisguises Auggie and he over hears his so called 'bestfriend' Jack Willsaying he 'would kill himself' if he looked like Auggie which leads tothe break of their friendship, but don't worry not all is lost theymake up over Minecraft and become the best of friends once again, theirtrue friendship is seen when some older kids begin to pick on them inthe woods on their residential trip, they target Auggie and Jack Willliterally fights back, they are soon joined by more boys in their classand they become the victors. This is also seen earlier when Jack Willpunches Julian (Bryce Gheisar) for making fun and bullying Auggie. Overthis film was an awakening into human kindness and human wickedness. Itis a reality check in how we judge and treat others that do not look'normal'. By the end of the film Auggies space helmet is no longervisible as his dad Nate (Owen Wilson) hides it and begs Auggie not totell his Mother (Julia Roberts). Go and watch this now!
