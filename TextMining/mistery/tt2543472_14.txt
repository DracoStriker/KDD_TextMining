WONDER is in the vein of MASK and BOY IN THE PLASTIC BUBBLE as storiesof young boys growing up with the odds against them because of aphysical malady. It's sweet and inspiration with another terrificperformance by Jacob Trembley (ROOM) as Auggie, a child with TreacherCollins Syndrome, which despite numerous surgeries, leaves him with aface that is less than classically attractive. The cast overall is strong with Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson asAuggie's parents, and Izabela Vidovic as his sympathetic sister. DaveedDiggs and Mandy Patinkin are solid as his teacher and principalrespectively. While not overly sentimental, Director and Co-WriterStephen Chbosky and his collaborators don't always find the right noteor touch with the dialogue. The script (based on R.J. Palacio's novel)feels contrived at times (and the pop culture references are sprinkledin a bit too liberally at time), but the force of the acting ensemblemostly carries it over some unsteady passages. The supporting cast isalso progressively thought out which adds to the general uplifting feelof the production. WONDER is imperfect, but it's good to see a movie which can be enjoyedby the whole family. And, who doesn't a little uplift at the moviesonce in a while?
