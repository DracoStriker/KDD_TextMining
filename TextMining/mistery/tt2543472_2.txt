13 November 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight -Wonder. Today is world kindness day and a link appeared on Facebookoffering free tickets at cinemas across the country to see a specialpre-release preview of this beautiful film. Wonder is the story ofAuggie Pullman who is born different. Home schooled, his mother feelsit's time for him to enter mainstream education and he joins the 5thgrade. People can be cruel and kids can be cruellest of all and Auggiestruggles in a world where everyone stares and whispers and evenbullies. It's not only Auggie who struggles however, as the filmprogresses we are told the story from different angles, that of Auggiehimself, his sister, his sister's friend and his own new friend. Allhave issues which are both affected and unaffected by the way Auggielooks. This is a heartwarming tale, based on a New York Timesbestselling book. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play the parents wholove their son fiercely and ache for his anguish and rejoice in hissuccesses as he finds his way in the world of the 5th grade. I urge youto go and see this, easy to watch and the characters are all endearingin their own way, even the bullies. I believe it's on general releaseat the beginning of December.
