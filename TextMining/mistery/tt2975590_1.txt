Sadly, a step down from Man of Steel. First of all, I was a bitskeptical about this movie, and thought the runtime (about 2 and a halfhours) was way too long (and I wasn't completely wrong though). Theaction scenes were better than what we saw in the trailer. Although thedoomsday scenes had terrible CGI (you'll know it when you'll see it),but overall I was happy. The movie had a lot crazy-packed action (itwas directed by Zack Snyder, what do ya expect?) but the plot didn'tknow where it was going. A lot of scenes were a treat for me to see andI got goosebumps watching them. There was more to Jesse Eisenberg thanwhat I saw (and hated, like most people) in the trailer. I made a betto my friend that he'll suck in the movie, guess I'll have to pay up.He really WAS good. But just like any other movie, it's not perfect andhas flaws. You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everythingnicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen. Otherthan that, I think there are some fan-boys who'll be satisfied nomatter how bad the movie is. Hope my review didn't give away anyspoilers in any way whatsoever, and that you end up enjoying the movieas much as (or more than) I did.
