I wanted to love this movie, it had potential to be a great superherofilm but it was pretty God awful. The plot was confusing, the cgi wasbad, Doomsday appeared WAY TOO EARLY and Superman DIES in his secondappearance. And the casting was bad. I mean Jesse Einsberg as LexLuther? The good things about this was the acting, it was pretty well.Wonder Woman was also AWESOME but overall this is a very poor movie.Save your money for Captain America Civil War instead because it willunfortunately be a lot better than this.Don't bother seeing this unless your a fan of DC because there is a lotof eye candy and Easter eggs.
