This is, hands down, the worst piece of entertainment i have seen in mylife! Forget about coherence, forget about story, forget about humor,you find non in this junkyard. Batman vs Superman is about two wannabebodybuilders who try to build up a heated and involuntarily gayatmosphere in 2.5 hours only to fight for 4 min with CGI rubble flyingaround. It is Brokeback Mountain meets Crossfitt commercial. Poor BenAfleck never looked dumber! I am trying hard to find anything positivewith this movie but it is really really hard. download thismasterpiece,see 5 min and turn it off. Go do something nice with yourbuck! P.s. Avengers was crappy in its own right but this one takes theword to a new height!P.P.s If your looking at the user review section to see a better feelfor what people think of the movie, just beware of the fact that warnerbrothers hires people to make thousands of fake accounts to score thismovie 10/10 to raise the overall score.
