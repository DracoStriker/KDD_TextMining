There aren't any flaws in the movie it's just there was no time and they have to squeeze all of these many stories together .If the movie had been divided into two parts then it would have been better . Batman had less action scenes then expected (or the action was so great the we wanted more of it),hopefully we would see more of it in the director's cut of the movie.I see the the negative reviews and I get it why critics don't like the movie(too dark,no humor.bad writing,etc)but its a good frickin movie,i just hope they do a better job in the coming movies.I am happy because this was not like any marvel movie ,it was completely different and as the fan of both the universes I will get to see totally different types of live action movie of these universes
