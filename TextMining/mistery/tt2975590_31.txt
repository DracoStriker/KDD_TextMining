This is the one and only superhero movie that i did not enjoy.It's like too much story going on and forced to be one movie.SPOILERS AHEAD: How i see it, the whole story of the movie goes likethis :1. Okay,you all know batman and superman, now we have to make themfight each other.2. Let's set up superman to be the villain! as a new watcher( i neverread the comics,etc) but there is a rich kid (Lex Luther) hatessuperman and want to pit him again Batman and We don't know why.3. This is supposed to be a mega movie, is there some alien or anythingto create major problem or threat that make them fight? NO. Lets jutkidnap superman's mom and make them fight!4. In the end, we all know they will make peace and fight he bad guys.But how? OKAY OUR MOTHER HAVE THE SAME NAME, LETS BE FRIENDS! I mean,what the hell?? did I miss something? is it really that they make peacebecause their mother have the same name. Come on...5. This is a mega movie, we have to at least have one super bad monsterto threat the world. BAM! Somehow super-duper-strong monster created inthe middle of the city, by using General zod's corpse created by LexLuthor, out of nowhere. this is pathetic..6. Then they make peace and going the fight the monster. but Hey, let'sleave a super useful Kryptonite weapon to fight any alien on a ruins,so I will have a hard time to get it if we ever need to use it again.7. Okay for to make the movie more marketable and cool trailer, we willstar Wonder Woman in the movie! and create a little shade mystery abouther so she can appear in the end to fight the monster. Or maybe themonster appear so the wonderwoman can appear? Up to youBut other than that, the special effect, acting were good. Afflect wascool as Batman. But i never feel disappointed like this after i watch asuperhero movie. especially as hyped as this one.Maybe people will see this movie on other perspective. 1/10 for me
