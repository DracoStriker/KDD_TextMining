Spoilers below Clearly this film was just an attempt to make money byhaving superman and batman in the same film and they didn't even botherto add a plot to the story and just throw each other through buildings.I think everyone knew this film was doomed from the start, for me theworst part of the movie was Jesse eisenberg as lex luthor,the plot oflex was bad enough never mind with having to watch Jesse who is anawful actor ruin One of the greatest villains. I don't think they couldof got a worse actor to play lex. watched 2hours of building up to thebatman vs superman fight which the film was meant to be about endedwithin 10 minutes because they have the same mothers name. I'm guessingthis film was made for children because no one over the age of 10should be happy watching this abomination. Just like man of steel thereis a city destroying battle yet Lois lane is in the middle of thedestruction crying about superman. 2 and a half hours of 30 secondscenes and I can't even remember a lot of the story as it was thatboring? I feel sorry for anyone over the age of ten rating this filmamazing or even average as this film was a train wreck and there isnothing positive in this lazy written story
