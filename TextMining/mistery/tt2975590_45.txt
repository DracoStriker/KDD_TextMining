I've never thought of Ben Affleck as someone who overacted a role. Hemanaged to do so. Henry Cavill constantly looked like he either neededa teleprompter for his lines or the laxative had just kicked in and thebathroom was too far away. If Lois Lane is supposed to look like"little girl lost" then Amy Adams did a good job. Jesse Eisenberg justmade me want to reach through the screen and choke his little throat.Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne did well with limited screen timeand, for Mr. Fishburne in particular, limited and wimpy lines. HollyHunter's character was scripted all over the place and she could neverbuild anything. Jeremy Irons. Now there was a character worth watching.Well played with a droll and from time to time dismissive attitude ("ifthere is another ..."). Gal Gadot might have been more impressive ifthere had been a little more development for her. Either as the "secretidentity" or as WW. The most realistic characterization was MIchaelShannon as Zod. And he was dead.If someone hadn't given me the tickets I'd want my money back. I wanttheir money back. For me the best part of the movie was seeing it atthe Alamo Drafthouse and having an excellent dinner.If you haven't seen it yet, wait until a friend buys the disk but hehas to provide the beer and pizza.
