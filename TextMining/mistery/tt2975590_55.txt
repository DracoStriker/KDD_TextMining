Once a movie that i was extremely nervous about stepping into, justhappened to turn out to be my favorite superhero movie, and probablywill for years to come, very interesting aspect of the movie was usingthe flaws of the first installment of the comic book universe andbuilding upon those mishaps to create a much better - more compellingstory, Another aspect that really stood out was the dialogue, whichyou, the viewer can really tell has been improved, Thanks to ChrisTerrio.Though these aspects of the film were really well done what reallypulled me in to the movie was the performances by the the actors,mainly Jesse Eisenberg and Ben Affleck's Performances, they reallygrabbed your attention through a large amount of the scene's showingreally great character development from both, also to add i wasn'texpecting much from Gal Gadot, shocking to think, as her performancewas fantastic -shocking- also to add she really had some great fightscenes that really hooked me, there wasn't a dull moment through outthe hole movie, and also fast pasteThe cinematography used in the movie is fantastic, and i believe someof these moment within the film will be with us for some time, Overallcan't say anymore great things about this movie, it's left mespeechless.
