The whole premise of this movie is just ridiculous. Batman and Supermanhate each other for no good reason. Their characters are way offcompared to their comic-book counterparts that it's just plaininsulting and ridiculous. They are so hell bent on killing each otherand blinded by arrogance that neither of them give a second thought tokilling innocent civilians.In the end the only thing that stops them is that they discover thattheir mother has the same name, and just like that they become the bestof pals(I get the meaning but it's still stupid as hell).Jesse Eisenberg belongs in tacky teenage comedies and they could nothave picked a more unsuitable actor to play Lex Luthor. He is simplyirritating throughout the whole movie.I managed to stick it out to the end but regretted doing this once theythrew in another "bad guy" in to the mix in the shape of an orc oruruk-hai from Lord of the Rings, just goddamn awful.The actions scenes were good enough though so there's that, but that'sjust about the only thing worth mentioning on this mess of a film.My advice, don't waste your time with this movie.
