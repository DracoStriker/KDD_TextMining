Wow...like I tried to ignore all the bad reviews to give it a fair gobut honestly I don't think I've been more bored since the phantommenace.There was just too much going on and guess what?..another flashback ofthe Waynes being gunned down (how many times do we really need to seethis?..WE ALL KNOW!). The movie has so many flashbacks and prettypointless dream sequences. Lex Luthor is just incredibly annoying andtotally miscast, he clearly is DC's marketing manager with some nicelylogo'd files on even more films to come.Wonder Woman was pretty underused despite her being pretty powerful.Probably my biggest hate of the whole movie was the sudden stop to thenamesake battle. It was like wow, your mum's called Martha, so ismine!!..let's be best buds.This is a film for those channels nobody watches.
