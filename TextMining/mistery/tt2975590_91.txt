The batman vs superman concept was always a dumb idea... in comics, inconversation, but especially in this movie. The movie starts out in a silly situation... (no spoilers here) andjust progresses to get less and less interesting. It's not that Affleck is the worst batman since joel schumacher decidedto put nipples on the batsuits... even though he is.It's not that the guy playing superman somehow has no charisma at all. Gal Gadot could have been OK with a better script but it's hard to tellsince the character is kind of flat. Save your time. Watch something (anything) else.
