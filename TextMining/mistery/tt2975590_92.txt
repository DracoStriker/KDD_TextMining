This was a good first movie which sole purpose is to launch a universefor the upcoming DC comic movies. I really enjoyed it and it did notfeel jumbled up. Those who say it's jumbled up are just lazy in tryingto figure out how the key details relate to the whole picture. Criticswill always criticize, in the end it's what true fans think about themovie is what matters. I can't wait for the upcoming movies! All theactors did good. For all those who complained about Benn Affleck andGal Gadot being in the movie would be in for a surprise as both nailedtheir roles. This proves once again that people shouldn't judge anactor or movie without actually seeing it.
