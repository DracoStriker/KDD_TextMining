I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've beenso much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative feltfractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Supermanwas relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn'tget a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Callingit 30 mins of "extra" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it'sexactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can sayabout the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements -music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extendedcut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointedscenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue.Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. ClarkKent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the peopleafter the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to thebottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan -everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, sothere's no change there :) Also, the "Martha" scene seems betterexecuted, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time tobreathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get theBluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I'veseen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is themovie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's agritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEUmovie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature filmmaking without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to bephilosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make youchuckle.
