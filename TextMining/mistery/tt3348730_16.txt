I really enjoyed this new Saw movie. A good sequel and welcome additionto the series. It did feel very different than the rest of the series,though. The music, the traps, the nods and Tobin Bell helped it feelmore like a Saw movie. Other than that, it felt like a horror versionof Law & Order. It was better than most of the sequels in the series.The gore has been toned down a lot in this one, but that didn't botherme too much. There was one scene that I was so 'flabbergasted' that Ifelt like the last 11 years of my life were a lie. I was literallyshivering with excitement during the last 5 minutes when they revealthe big twist, which was pretty cool. Ten years after the death of John Kramer/Jigsaw, a new game starts up,baffling Detectives Halloran and Hunt. Their only suspect has been shotand put into a coma. Meanwhile, five people wake up in a barn in a newtrap. Jigsaw wants them to confess their sins, using all sorts of newdeadly traps. Forensic pathologists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonnvillehelp the Detectives with their case and try to figure out where the newgame is being played. If you've been a Saw fan from the very beginning,you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend JIGSAW!!!
