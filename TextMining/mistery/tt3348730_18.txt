I went into this movie thinking I was just gonna enjoy it as part ofthe franchise, but this was actually quite well done. Not to mentiongenuinely intense and suspenseful. The production values and acting arevisibly better as well. There is gore, but it's done in a fun way that makes the gore in theother sequels look obligatory and boring. Also unlike the sequels,which seem to mostly build on a single concept, this installment setsitself apart by incorporating interesting story elements that wereseparate from Jigsaw, but also made him and the movie itself moreinteresting.Finally, the story was unpredictable and had numerous twists I didn'tsee coming.All and all, a solid and entertaining movie that manages to stand onits own while sticking to the series' story. It was worth the price ofadmission!
