Since watching (then all 7 of the Saw Films) back in 2012, I waseagerly anticipating this one on it's release & was constantly checkingon Google for a Saw 8 being release with fake trailers, to built uparticles on the subject! Highs & Lows & hopes being lifted & dropped onthis film ever being made until....it was then on Feb 2016, Jigsaw wason its way to being made! At first I took it with a pinch of salt, butthen it grew & it was then known as Saw: Legacy! Casting started,Filming, then the official name, then the trailer! And finally thefilm!!!Having got back from a showing I must say this was awesome! The trapswere epic! The twist was amazing & the whole story was simply a greattribute to the previous instalments! The 7 year wait was bloody worthit & any Saw Fan or Horror Fan alone should go & see this!Screw the haters (especially the Saw ones) who are too pussy to go &watch this, it's an awesome piece of film making that should beappreciated! I won't spoil too much as you should go & see this for yourself! I hopefor a 9th entry in this amazing franchise!Overall, 10/10! Simply ace!
