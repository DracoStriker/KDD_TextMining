Jigsaw is a continuation of the long running series and this film haslived up to the franchise. This is filled with twists and turns, makingeveryone wonder what just happened. If you have followed the franchise so far, you know what has happenedto jigsaw and his following, but this film has some great twists. Thething I loved about this film is that it feels like you are trying tofind out who the killer is as well when they end up throwing a randomplot twist in it. Everyone around me had their jaws drop with some ofthe reveals and twists. If you like the original films, this did not disappoint and is one ofmy favorite in the Franchise. The traps are more unsettling and theintensity is still high. They answer some of the questions that werepreviously left, while also leaving it open for other films to be madein the future, while also being able to end the film to satisfy if theydecide to end the franchise. I am a saw fan for life!
