This movie deserves more attention. Out of so many horror movies with aweak plot, weak meaning, non-intriguing story and without a MESSAGE ontop of everything, SAW does it all! I don't care what anyone says, justmy opinion. If anybody talks trash it's because they didn't saw fromthe beginning... PERIOD.
