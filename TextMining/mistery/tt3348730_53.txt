I gave it a 5 out of 10 and I'll tell you why. This review will besimple. I am a huge SAW fan and I've been waiting 7 years for SAW 8 akaJigsaw to get answers to questions in SAW 7, did we get any answers nowe didn't. I gave this film a 5 because it has Tobin Bell in it andthat's really the main draw to the film for me because I love Tobin.The film itself was okay but it could have been better. Of course Ican't stay anything about the film because that would be giving stuffaway so if you are a SAW fan like me don't expect to get any answers toyour questions about SAW 7 because you won't get them with Jigsaw.
