Great story-line for an ordinary horror movie .I always thought the newseason of saw/jigsaw will trace back to the previous season whenHoffman was trapped in the room or Dr. Gordon but it didn't. Itcould've been better if they brought more of the old characters or atleast have mentioned their names and to use only the mechanical trapsinstead of the laser traps
