An R rated extended cut version of CSI. Full of tacky/cheesy lines. Allthat's missing is The Who saying "YEAHHHHHHHH". Yes, it's entertainingat times, but the acting is basically comical. I'm going to assumethat's just the style they wanted to take as in some respects the SAWseries is almost a "cultish" film. Wait for it to be added to Netflixwhen you can be playing drinking games with the boys and take shots forevery serious line that makes you laugh. Saturday's are for the boys.
