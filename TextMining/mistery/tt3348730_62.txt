I thought, well, jigsaw is death what are they going to do with him andwith the franchise. Is it going to be another entry or a sequel. Afterseeing it I had a good feeling about it, simply because it's a mixtureof then and now and there's not that much of a story going on, it's allabout the traps.If you are into the franchise then it's a must see that deliver on allsides. I mean, you will come across jigsaw, you will have your tortureporn but you will surely have your gory moments. Question I had a lotwas, I didn't saw the earlier entries will I be able to follow thestory. No probs. Throughout the flick everything is explained about himso don't worry, newcomers can pick it up too.You won't go to see it for a the acting because it's not all that Oscarwinning style but you go to those kind of movies pure for the horror.On that fact, effects are really well done and they don't hide thegore. The theater was half full when I saw it and the first gory momentsome were laughing but most off them were offended by the scene, sogore-hounds, it's out there for you.The twist at the end, that I didn't see coming, makes it of course opento make part 9, will it? I don't know but the franchise is still fresh.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5
