"Jigsaw" is the 8º movie of the franchise "Saw" and i only have seenTHIS movie i haven't seen the others ones so this review is only aboutthis one. Well, i liked the movie but the movie don't have my type ofhorror, i prefer psychological terror instead of physical, but that'sopinions, i liked the cast and the script was really nice. That's why igave a 8 out of 10. (It's my opinion, because horror it's not my kindof movie, so, don't hate me because of this please).
