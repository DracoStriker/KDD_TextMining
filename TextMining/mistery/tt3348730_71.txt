For me the best thing about sequel is the unity. Each one of themcomplete the others missing parts. This one is totally apart from therest About movie, thriller wasn't enough, traps wasn't excited, spilledblood wasn't enough.Storyline seem like rushed, was weak. I expected much more. Wasdisappointing for me. At the end i waited for "Game over" with shutted door. At least don'ttake it away from me right. But they did. Worst one of the sequel for me . Sorry about that. It is disgrace forJohn's legacy.By the way Laura Vandervoort your color is the brown thrust me <3
