The moment the Jigsaw movie starts it wastes no time into gettingstraight to the point and straight into the action. We thrown straightinto the "Jigsaw" traps that we all know and love, only this time thegame is more harder and the traps are very well thought out, andsurprisingly there's not that much blood.The acting is decent by everyone involved. No one really stood out thatmuch except for the legendary Tobin Bell who plays Jigsaw (which yousee in flashbacks). The direction was fine, and the entire set up wasfine. Another thing we will say is that the entire pace of the filmmoved along very nicely, never a dull moment. There are loads ofkillings in the movie and each kill is done in a very stylized way soneedless to say the body count is very high! To be honest The SawMovies have just got old and it's time to stop making them. It's justgetting way too much. There's nothing wrong with this movie really,it's all good fun and it's decent stuff, but it's just time to stopwith these Jigsaw Movies. Jigsaw died 10 years ago and all these copycat effects are just getting old. It is worth seeing, because it is funand thrilling enough to see. 3/5 stars. Jay And Nick.
