Saw has had many ups and downs as a series. The "final chapter" in 2010was about as limp as soggy bread, giving us nothing shocking and along-expected twist.Jigsaw begins anew (don't expect Hoffman or Dr. Gordon to return) andfeatures new characters and a new set of games. But...how can this beif John Kramer died over ten years ago? Is he really dead? He has tobe. Right?There are definite improvements here. The cinematography and productiondesign is light years beyond the previous movies. I used to refer toSaw having "faketography" with some of the rudest, ugliest, andcheapest filters and color corrections ever to dirty the big screen.Jigsaw, being the first to be shot in 2.35:1, actually looks cinematicand it's the film's best feature. The games and traps themselves aregruesome but not overplayed, which took the focus away from tortureporn and gave it a bit more of the psychological edge we got in thefirst movie.Sadly, it fails elsewhere. The story gives us YET MORE cops, YET MOREcoroners, and YET MORE doctors (all of them forgettable) filling up theside story. Sorry, but after a seven-year hiatus this should have beenmore unique and subversive. I gotta admit though, that twist ending hadme kicking myself, and Charlie Clouser's score is as intense as ever.Not a bad film, but not the huge comeback it should have been. I rankit somewhere in the middle of the series overall.
