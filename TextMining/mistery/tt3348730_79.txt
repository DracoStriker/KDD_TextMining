i went to see jigsaw last night and it was worth the effort, tobin bellwas excellent, the leg trap was really uncomfortable and the way thebicycle trap went wrong was very nice, i also liked the final lasertrap and its outcome. the woman who appeared with the weird obsessionwas a nice bizarre touch, i am trying to describe some of the thingswhich happened without giving away their outcomes. several scenes mademe cringe, aside from the leg scene i felt that maybe some of thehorror had been toned down to create more of a thriller than a purehorror film. i think jigsaw was very entertaining but could have beeneven more horrific than it was. the plot twists worked very well, thefinal revelation made sense and was a real surprise. the characters hadsome nice development, their crimes were certainly worth challengingmaking the film morally ambiguous. one female character did somethingreally bad which turned out to be a really disturbing moment, she meetsan appropriate fate. i thought i had figured out who it was, the finalminutes proved i was wrong on one very important score there. thepractical effects were very good, one cgi moment near the end stood outas being obvious cgi though it was a nasty idea. i was glad to be ableto watch an adult horror movie for a change, it is also very good andworth catching, as is the ritual. in some ways these two are better asthey are less used, saw has now run to eight films and is running outof original ideas, some of jigsaw seemed a bit samey even though it waswell made it seemed like some old and familiar ideas. i would beprepared to watch more sequels, though saying that they will all followsimilar structures, which is really a given with this series.
