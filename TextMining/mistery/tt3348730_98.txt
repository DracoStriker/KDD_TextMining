So,tonight Jigsaw premiered in my cinema and for some reason,the cinemaroom was empty,so,that was OK,I was alone. The film followed the storyof another guilty bunch who are pursued in to a game of grisly games asthe new killer may actually be Jigsaw himself,yes,Jigsaw. So,I actuallykind of wished I did not have to see this,I had already gone on a bigshopping spree with my family,surprising me due to it being my birthdayand afterwards,I was wrecked..but,for you guys,I saw it! The openingscene in Jigsaw made me actually wanna fall asleep,I was really tiredbut sat through the whole thing and was it worth it..not really. I kindof wished to be honest,I did not see Jigsaw,wasting money on myself,thefilm was just another crappy Saw film,well,not too crappy. Jigsaw wasnot really all that bad,I thought the traps though were kind of poorhaving it have the exact same kind of theme of traps to Saw V,one thingthough I did love about this film was the ending that really had melike..what?! I wont spoil,but it was a brilliant ending,the acting inthe film was OK,something that was weird was the setting,I felt alsothat this was not even a Saw film,when you think about the first sevenhaving been set in old dungeons and stuff,this had barley anyresemblance to it which is something that I admired,the actual veryending to the film was OK with that trap at the end being definitelycrap,I mean,like there's bad traps,but the laser one..OH MY GOD!!Jigsaw is a mixed sequel with good things and bad things but at the endof the day,will Saw ever change?
