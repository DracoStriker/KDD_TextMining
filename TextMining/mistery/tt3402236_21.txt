I was pleasantly surprised by Kenneth Branagh's performance. When hefirst appeared on screen, I thought that he would quickly becometedious and annoying. However, as time went on, I found myself reallygetting into his character. Branagh plays him with such ridiculouseccentricity that he actually became rather charming and relatable.Now, it's not an Oscar worthy performance by any stretch of theimagination, but I do think it does say something about his ability asan actor to take these idiosyncrasies that normally would have annoyedme and in turn make them charming, as well as fulfilling his otherduties as the director. The film is also very well shot. I wassurprised by how much I was getting into the cinematography. Branaghworks with long-time collaborator Haris Zambarloukos in order to makeperfect use of the cramped quarters of the train. Whether its panningshots outside of the train looking in, or overhead shots looking downon the actors, Zambarloukos makes very distinct and interesting choicesthat allow for Murder on the Orient Express to come to life in a ratherunique way, one that I wasn't expecting from the looks of the trailers.
