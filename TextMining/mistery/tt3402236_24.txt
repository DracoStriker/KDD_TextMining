I definitely enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express. It was a fun murdermystery. The greatest thing about this movie was, hands down, thewhodunit feel. Murder on the Orient Express was very reminiscent of theScooby Doo or Nancy Drew mysteries from my childhood. The detective, isHercule Poirot, a borderline OCD character that strives to find an evenbalance in everything in life. Because of his unique outlook, he hasthroughout his life become a great detective with the ability to seethings that are out of place. While trying to go on a real vacation, hetakes the train Orient Express where there is eventually, of course, amurder. The movie follows the detective as he strives to ascertain themurderer by finding clues, questioning the other passengers formotives, and cross referencing alibis. I thought the characters werewell played by their actors, the flow of the movie was never stale, andthe detectives mustache were on point. Throughout the movie I wasswitching between which passenger was my top suspect for the case, andthe ending did not disappoint me.
