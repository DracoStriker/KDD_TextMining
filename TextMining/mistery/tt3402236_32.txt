This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiaritywith Agatha Christie's work. Branagh's portrayal of the legendaryBelgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance tothe source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache,and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, itis a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well andit would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the firsttime and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.A strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley,Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many otherfamiliar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the wayIngrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the2010 version.There were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out ofcharacter for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify thesudden stylistic change. The ending hints at Death on the Nile beingthe next mystery for this detective masquerading as Poirot to tackle,but Poirot should not be summoned to solve a murder, he simply stumblesupon them whenever he goes on vacation.
