I love the book so I was really excited to see this, and I have to sayI was not disappointed. The acting was brilliant and the film very wellmade. Aside from a few changes it mostly follows the book quite closelywhich I was pleased about and the end was especially well done. I haveto confess that I haven't actually got round to seeing any of the otheradaptions of the book yet but I certainly enjoyed this one.
