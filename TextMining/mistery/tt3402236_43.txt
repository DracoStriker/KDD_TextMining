Let me just say this is the first version of Murder on the OrientExpress I ever saw. I haven't read the book either, but was reallycurious to see this movie. I saw it in cinema a couple of hours ago andwhen I came online here, I had to write a review of my own because Ionly saw negative ones and wondered why. I loved it. It's a movie I'dgo and see multiple times. Yes, it can be a bit slow some times, but Ithink it matches the theme. (Of course, the Imagine Dragons music inthe trailer and the hideous modern, blue fonts were a mistake I findodd. True style breaker.) The costumes and set is just lovely, I wasblown away by the creative aspects of the camera. There's one shotthat's 'hanging on the ceiling' and you look down at two heads. Ithought that was brilliant, in that setting at that specific time inthe story. Furthermore I thought all performances were good and itwasn't a Branagh one-man show, it was the full cast that got me. Ibelieved their characters and didn't expect the ending of this film.Unlike some people here, I recommend you to see it.
