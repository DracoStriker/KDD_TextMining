I thought the critics were harsh, I enjoyed it- I've not yet read thebook or seen the original 1974 movie, but this film reminded me one oneof my favorite board games Cluedo,,, the cinematography was great, itwas good acting all around and I really liked the musical score so muchthat I'll buy it as soon as it's released
