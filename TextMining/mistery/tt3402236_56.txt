I must admit, I have no familiarity with any of Agatha Christie storiesand have never seen the original of this film so I am coming at thisreview from the angle of a complete Poirot 'newbie' but I reallyenjoyed the film. I thought the cast was superb and to me, it felt likea proper 'film' rather than a clichéd 'who dunnit' type movie where youdon't actually care what happened if you're honest. I liked theback-story and how things twisted and turned and I thought Kenneth wasfabulous as Poirot....he is one of my favourite actors though and I'dlike him in anything but jackoby and Depp were both also very good aswas Dame Judi Dench. It wasn't the most action packed movie I've everseen and I do wish that the audience could have been given more in theway of evidence and time to work things out for ourselves as I did feelPoirot kind of got to the bottom of things based on intuition ratherthan evidence which gave us the audience no hope in getting therefirst! Other than that though it was superb and I enjoyed it beginningto end, I felt genuinely choked up at the end and this is not somethingthat happens a lot with me. Well done all x
