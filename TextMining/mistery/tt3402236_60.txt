Fans of Agatha Christie be warned: I've loved her books since I was akid, ravenously snatching them from the library shelves often, and Icouldn't wait to see this director and cast have a shot at makingChristmas 2017 joyous by reigniting the Orient Express and againplunging it into the gorgeous remote scenery of its locale, filled withinteresting characters and a mysterious middle-of-the-night murder. Thetrain itself and the scenery are about all there is to see in thisremake, and the film is easily one of the biggest disappointments ofthe season (and year). There are times in this film where I could swearthe cast is reading their lines off teleprompters--it's that lifeless.Filmmaking 101 says when you make a film version of a book you want toopen up the imagination of viewers with visuals that illustrate thewords rather than just having characters read the words rote andlifelessly on-screen in static exposition. Kenneth Branagh, as bothdirector and star, lets us down completely, and all of these fineactors are completely wasted, as is Christie's glorious and vividstory. Read the book or see the 1974 film version with Albert Finney,Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman and Vanessa Redgrave.
