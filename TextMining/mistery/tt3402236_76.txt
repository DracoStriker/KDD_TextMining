Not bad, but OK, and very unnecessary, which isprobability the worse.  They made the movie back in 1974, based on thisnovel, The idea would be to bring something new to either the novel orthe book. I saw neither of these two things happen.Kenneth Branagh I am a fan of his as both an actor and a director (anda director who acts in his own movie).
