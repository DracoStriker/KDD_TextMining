Do not be fooled by the many reviews here claiming the 1974 version wasbetter. They are usually written by people oppose any kind ofinnovation and are forever stuck into the past. Everything before the90's = good everything else that comes after = bad, I'm sure you knowthat kind of mind set we all have that one grandparent.This movie is a masterpiece. The acting was impeccable, the story wasmind blowing, the setting...god the setting made it all fit together.This movie makes the viewer follow the investigation step by step,evidence by evidence and even gives room to the viewer to conjurehis/her own case. The combination of the different accents andbackstories, who were incredibly well done by the way, gives a greatsense of immersion.Rarely have I ever been so amazed by a story such as this one, and theending... was just perfection. It's a movie I'll definitely be seeingagain.If you have any sense of objectiveness, this remake pillars over theold one by miles and miles. Anything else and you're just in denialhonestly.
