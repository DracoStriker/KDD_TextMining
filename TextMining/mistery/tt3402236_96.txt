I saw "Murder on the Orient Express", starring Kenneth Branagh-Dunkirk, Wild Wild West_1999; Johnny Depp-Fantastic Beasts and Where toFind Them, Dark Shadows_2012; Michelle Pfeiffer-Mother!, DarkShadows_2012 and Daisy Ridley-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, Lifesaver.This is a remake of the 1974 movie that is based on an Agatha Christienovel she wrote in 1934. She wrote quite a few books about an observantdetective named Hercule Poirot, a Belgium version of SherlockHolmes-she also wrote about a character named Miss Marple or somethinglike that but I did not read them. I remember reading and being a fanof her books on Hercule Poirot when I was growing up. This movie isdirected by Kenneth Branagh-Cinderella_2015, Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit,Thor-who also stars as the famous detective. Kenneth is taking a tripon the Orient Express train traveling from Istanbul to Paris with 13other passengers-all quite recognizable actors. Johnny, Michelle andDaisy are some of the passengers, all of which have secrets that cometo light when one of the 13 turns up dead. Boy, it's lucky that theyhave the world's greatest detective on board to help solve the case.One of the passengers was involved in a baby kidnapping that took place5 years earlier. This movie is not an action packed shoot em up butmore of a thinking man's workout for your brain, although there is alittle physical fisticuffs and some gun play. Oh yeah, I must mentionKenneth's mustache; It is rather big and very well groomed-he sleepswith a mask over it to protect it. At the end of the movie, there is aset up for the next one, Death on the Nile-that is, if this one makesmoney. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and thematic elements and has arunning time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. As I said earlier, I am a fan andenjoyed it enough to buy it on DVD.
