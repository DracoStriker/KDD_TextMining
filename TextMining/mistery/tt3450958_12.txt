Seriously, if you want to see 2 hours of apes locked in a cage thenjust go see it in person at your local zoo. The $15 admission fee isfor about the 15 minutes of CGI. This movie dragged on for so long thatI actually began rooting for the humans just so this thing would end.It truly has more plot holes than the Zapruder film. And that's noteven mentioning the absurd ending that makes absolutely no sense. Woody Harrelson is still a legend.
