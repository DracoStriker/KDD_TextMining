I was first reluctant to see this film when my friend invited me butafter seeing that it has a whopping 8.1 rating and remembering that theprevious films were quite enjoyable I was prepared to see a truly goodmovie. I was incredibly disappointed. **SPOILERS** My first troublewith the film happened with the appearance of the little girl, whoseemed to serve absolutely no purpose other than to spontaneously causetear- jerking moments which were accompanied by sad music in everyinstance. Throughout the film there must have been around 10 of these,all of them completely pointless and forced. It also baffled me thatshe had close to 0 reaction to her father dying yet, when a gorilla whoshe had known for literally one day died, she wept like it was herbrother. Another massive problem is that the entire plot of this moviehinges on one condition: that every single person out of the ~1,000soldiers at the concentration camp is a complete and utter imbecile.Caesar's crew is running around right outside of the walls of the camp?Of course no one notices, why would anyone be on over-watch at amilitary base? All of the monkeys escape from their cages? Of coursethere was only one person watching over them. In addition to that, forthe duration of what seemed like 10 minutes no one else even noticedthat all the monkeys were gone or that the single guard watching overthem was killed. Are these real soldiers!? Even statistically, what arethe chances that not a single soldier looked at a cage that is in plainview from any part of the camp. These were just the most glaring issuesI had with the film. So little thought went into the script. These areincredibly basic problems which could have been fixed with even theslightest effort, This movie was so incredibly dumb that even my friendwho doesn't have much interest in film asked me if I wanted to leavebefore the film was over.
