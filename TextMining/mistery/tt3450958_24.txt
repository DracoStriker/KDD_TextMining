I want to give it more, but it is no where near up to the quality ofthe first two films in the series, by a very large margin. I reallyenjoyed 'Rise' and thought that 'Dawn' was more than an acceptablesequel, but this one is seriously let down by screenplay, plot,dialogue and is just appears aimless and too incredible.....I believeit missed, quite badly. I will always love the brilliant Andy Serkis, and enigmatic WoodyHarrelson who both have been in some stunning movies (Peter Jackson'sbrilliant 'Lord of the Ring'Trilogy and 'No Country for Old Men'respectively) and Mr Serkis tries keeps the character of Caesarconsistent and vibrant even in this film, but the rest of the movie isvery slow going, fails to engage a lot of the time, quite soporific inplaces and I conclude that it has let down the other two really good &exciting movies before it hugely. It could have been so much better if the screenwriters had steered theplot in a completely different direction, and actually had a "War"!There they should have referred to the great Peter Jackson who waseminently able to show his prowess with the battles in Return of theKing. This one really failed. It was full of spent movie themes andtired clichés (e.g. a lot of Vietnam based rescue movies, vengeance forthe murder of the family, etc etc). In fact it was more like an Apeversion of a Mad Max movie! Only much worse because we were expectingso much more. Very disappointing. I will be cautious when I see the name of thedirector and writers in further films. They have upset a lot of 'Planetof the Ape' fans and need to redeem themselves.
