I get it. It's quite simple actually. When you have 150m budget, youcan afford to spend 50-60k for 5000 10 stars votes. Are plenty ofwebsites offering this kind of "services".Is the only logical, rational explanation for the rating this piece ofgarbage managed to have.Don't waste your time or money. There is no war, no depth, nothing.Just social justice messages shoved deep down your throat. Ah, and halfton monkeys riding (super)horses.Just... buy a bag of chips and stare at a wall for 2 hours. Or watchYouTube videos with monkeys. It's the same.
