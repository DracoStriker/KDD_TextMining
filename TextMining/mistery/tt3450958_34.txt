Just a bad movie, overall. The apes have human intelligence, but stillbasically live like tribesmen. Caesar and the apes allied with somehumans, but they're mysteriously long gone and haven't learned a thingfrom them, apparently. There's a message throughout the entire filmthat the apes are being oppressed, Caesar is a saint, almost likeNelson Mandela or something.The director really tried to send a blunt message in one scene with across hanging behind Woody Harrelson's character in his bedroom duringan interrogation of Caesar. To me, the anti-Christian message was loudand clear. It was no coincidence at all. I was thoroughly disgusted bythat. The Deux Ex Machina at the end was the last straw. It was the finalconfirmation of how terrible this movie was. What a shame.
