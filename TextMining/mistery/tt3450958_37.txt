For want of a better word, allegorical - but only in the sense that thewriters defaulted to familiar historical events and biblical storylines to compose an anti-content, challenge-bereft script. In parts Iquestioned whether I was watching a movie tailored to theintellectually-impaired, so banal and Dan-Brownlike were theand-then's; served dripping with saccharine sentimentality andheart-string tugging musical schmaltz. As a showcase for state of theart CGI it was...a showcase for state of the art CGI, nothing more.Recent reboot 1 nailed it; 2 flailed it; 3 failed it. Get your filthypaws off my franchise you damn dirty animator.
