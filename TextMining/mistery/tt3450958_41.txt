Don't believe the hype surrounding this movie. This movie was awful.This movie was so much of a letdown that i had to write my first reviewon this website. The other two in the series are way better than thisone. This movie was a bore! The planet of the apes with Mark Wahlbergwas better than this one. I don't see how the script was even approvedfor this movie. The only positive was the CGI and that was wasted moneysince this movie sucked.
