What an epic conclusion to an outstanding series. Shame the marketingcampaign did an awful job. Wait, I take that back. It was the title ofthe film that kept people away. Personally, I didn't watch this intheaters because I thought it was going to be just like the last apesfilm- which felt like a "war" film. Not saying the second apes filmwasn't great but we were lead to believe to was going to be the sameexact film - which would have been a put off if that was the case. Butmuch to my delight this was an epic odyssey of a film that did notdisappoint and helped to put this trilogy as one of the greatest filmtrilogies of all time. And it ties up all the loose ends perfectly.
