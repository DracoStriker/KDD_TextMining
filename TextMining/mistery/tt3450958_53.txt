Being a huge fan of the franchise, after seeing trailer, its footage,sound, ambiance, I had huge expectations for this movie, and could notwait for its release. I was not expecting perfection of course, but anaverage, solid movie, at least as good as the last 2 in the series. Iliked last 2 movies, they were not perfect, but good enough for me.After wasting 2 hours of my life on this movie disaster, I had to writemy first review ever, because never has a movie disappointed me thismuch. The marketing material (trailers, posters, music) is a complete lie! Ifyou expect anything resembling THE ultimate fight for survival, you arewatching the wrong movie. If you expect anything similar to epic "NO!"or "GO!" moments from previous movies, good luck with that! There isnothing EPIC, war-like in this movie at all. 5 people left the cinema in the middle of the screening, and I almostdid the same. During some "epic" scenes, I almost started laughing howbad it was. Couldn't wait for it to end. Felt I deserved refund.Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on this. If you expectedanything resembling last 2 movies, you are in for a big surprise.
