This movie is absolute trash. I am a huge fan of the franchise,including the first two installments of the reboot. This film wasincredibly disappointing. The plot was almost non-existent, the pacingwas all over the place, the tone kept juggling and the development wasforced. It felt like they had no clue how to end the trilogy, so they threwtogether a ton of walking inserts, and landscape shots with sprinklesof action sequences sparingly used throughout. Slow movies do notbother me but pretentious garbage like this film is entirely notwatchable. The solid cinematography and good use of CGI to not make upfor the nonsensical plot. Do yourself a favor and wait on this one. Believe all the bad reviews,I was anxiously awaiting the release of the film, only to be let down.Biggest disappointment of the summer by far.
