War for the Planet of the Apes is an emotionally complex epic and thebest of the reboot series by a long shot, boasting raw intensity andthought-provoking twists. It's a fitting conclusion to Caesar's story.I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this absolutemasterpiece of science fiction. Let me just say first that the trailersand ads showcased an influx of action and the title alone seems topromise non-stop sequences of bloodshed and destruction, but make nomistake, this is a drama film, through and through. The motion captureperformances are raw and poignant. A majority of the film (which isnearly two and a half hours long) doesn't have any spoken dialogue. Youabsorb everything through the ape's actions, facial expressions andemotions and it hits hard, especially when you witness them endure thebrutal wrath of the humans. The music by Michael Giacchino does abrilliant job setting the mood; it's the most moving score he's evercomposed and each character has their own specific theme. The settingand visuals also contribute to the emotional factor, displaying somerather gritty locations backed up by bold and skillful lighting andcolor correction techniques that ultimately breathes a bleak anddreadful atmosphere throughout the film's running time. Now give AndySerkis an Oscar, already.
