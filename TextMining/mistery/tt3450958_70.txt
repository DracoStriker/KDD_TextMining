Ignore the many 1-star reviews from adolescent game-boys who thrive onvirtual mass violence and destruction. Anyone else would quickly find asimilar endless succession of battle scenes pointless, tedious andextremely boring.For those of us who like a great movie, and who like to have our mindsand emotions engaged while watching, War for the Planet of the Apessupplies a complex and detailed story with plenty of everything thatmakes us love the experience, including great work behind the scenes(the CGI is amazingly realistic and the visuals very lush anddetailed), as well as behind the camera and in front of the camera.War for the Planet of the Apes is a very satisfying movie. Highlyrecommended for everyone (except 3D-war-and-action game addicted kids,teens and teens who never grew up).
