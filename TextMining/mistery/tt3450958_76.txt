This movie began with so much promise, however sadly by the end I feltlike asking for a refund. The visuals and cinematography were incredible, no doubting that. Whatangered me is the story-line and in particular the false title, "Warfor the Planet of the Apes". This movie does nothing to deserve thetitle and feels like the writers could not think of a story-line thathad the apes winning while also remaining the heroes (i.e. withoutkilling all humans).The so-called war involves a brief skirmish in the woods between apesand humans, followed by two hours of build up to a 10 minute battlebetween humans and humans. Whenever the movie gave us a hint of thebattle, with admittedly epic scenes which reminded me of a modern takeon the opening of Gladiator, the director cut away to Caesar skulkingaround, Woody Harrelson doing his best zombie impression, or the apeshiding behind rocks. And this "battle" is ended by a single grenadedestroying one human army, and a ridiculous avalanche destroying theother. Yes I accept that the avalanche may represent Mother Nature destroyingthe humans, but why in gods name was the story-line not about apesfighting a war against humans?This is my main issue with the movie, and I won't even go into thefarcically drawn out season of Prison Break lumped into the movie forno apparent reason. We wanted apes fighting humans. We got humans fighting humans, apes inprison, and apes getting a lucky break.
