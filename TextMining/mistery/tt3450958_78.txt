Those traitor apes are helping you but you treat them poorly. You areplaying with fire.You are the animals.Nice ad placement for Coke.They've walked into Frozen.Bad Ape is stylish.I've seen one, maybe two women soldiers?Not smart red shirt.I am surprised at Green Arrow.Ludicrous place to keep giant fuel tanks.Serious lack of diversity If we ignore the apes... weird huh, we have awhite male, a while female girl, another while male, a black malesergeant, a white female solider. The first three are the only oneswith any notable screen time. We see the sergeant maybe a minute totalonly because he is marching a column of troops twice, thus you noticewho is at the head of the column. There are basically 2 groups ofsoldiers. You can throw out the later as they are hearing HAZMAT suits.This leaves the white female soldier. There may have been 2 but you seeher so briefly in the sea of while male soldiers that if I blinkedtwice I never would've seen her at all. They lingered in her just longenough for me to notice she was a woman. Hard to tell with soliderhaircuts.
