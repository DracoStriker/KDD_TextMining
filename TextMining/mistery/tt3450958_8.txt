First time I've ever wrote a review on IMDb.The title says its all, if you're going to watch this film, watch thefirst 10mins and the last 20mins, you could go out of the cinemamid-way through and hardly miss anything.The first planet of the apes was the best, 2nd was good enough, 3rd isjust is just rubbish.Spoiler Towards the end of the film there is a massive oil tank in themiddle of the compound where the soldiers were holding out (dumb placeto put it), then getting attacked by Apache helis, you would think themassive group Apache helis could take the compound out about a mileaway, instead they are flying all beside each other flying over head.poor story line, poor acting, poor directing, awful film, don't botherwasting your money.
