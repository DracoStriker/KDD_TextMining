Plot; A new threat causes a faction of the remaining human army tobecome even more desperate to destroy the apes once and for all.The "War" in the title is a tad misleading here. It's got the trappingsof a war film, and there's some conflict, but anyone expecting factionsof apes and humans frothing at the mouth and charging toward oneanother in a last desperate battle for supremacy are going to be sorelydisappointed.With a glacial pace, one dimensional characters and ham-fisted drama,War utterly wastes its impressive technical merits. Whatever it lacksdramatically and intellectually--and it lacks a lot--the apes look damnimpressive.
