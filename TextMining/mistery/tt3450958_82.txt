i enjoyed the previous movies that this one precedes.but the writers have failed so hard in continuing the story. What isthis about now?exodus of the apes like the Israelite from Egypt? afaction of the army that looks like skin heads?what are they trying totell?the apes are the jews during holocaust?the writers tried too hard on making this movie more "thoughtprovoking" by selling us the cheap sentimental over-told horriblehumans' history as mentioned that it lost its identity, this issupposed to be a fictional movie about factions of apes and humans thatclashed not the ape's gulag or the ape version of sophie's choice.I really hope the don't make a next one.
