A lot of hate this movie gets is because people look at the title, andthink they are going in for a full action movie with lots of explosionsand fight scenes. Well, there are some, but this is not that kind ofmovie.All the three movies are about a biological disaster, the rise of a newintelligent species, and the confront that rises with humans. It isabout the psychological evolution of the apes, and how they deal withproblems and emotions that we, as humans, know a lot about. Fear, hate,love, hope.The CGI is amazing, and proves that we are on an era where animatedcharacters and actors start to become mixed and melted in ourperception.Overall, a great movie. It carries on the story of the first two in afluid and believable sequence of events. And yet, can surprise theaudience with some clever humor, and heartbreaking moments.
