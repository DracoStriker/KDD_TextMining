Thumbs down. Hot mess. I've been watching this series since the TV showas a little child and now as an adult, have been excited to follow thefilm series. This last one was disappointing garbage it should havebeen presented before me before production release so I could have slidit back across the table, stated go back to the drawing board, andfired someone. Are you kiddin me... and Caesar and his family couldhave had a better story line than that mess. Who wrote this?? good byefelicia...smh
