As a fan of dark comic book movies like The dark knight and Logan, myfavourite movie in MCU was The winter soldier but after seeing Thor Ijust couldn't believe a movie could have so much dark and light sideand still pull it off with such cohesion. major kudos to the directorand I always believed in him because "the hunt for Wilderpeople" hadthe same funny story line with dark moments in between, the Aussie andKiwi themed jokes were just awesome (I live in Australia). each castmember played there role to perfection and the relationship betweenThor and Loki just keeps getting better with time.
