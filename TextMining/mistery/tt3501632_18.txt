Every time I go into the movies I feel like playing the lottery. I hopefor the best but really don't know what I'm getting and I often feeldisappointed in the end. This time it was not the case. Marvel universemovies have been my favorites from the very beginning of the story andThor:Ragnarok as the latest edition has surpassed my expectations. Iwas hoping for a another good entry in the Marvel universe but this wason another level entirely. This movie is fun, funny, full of action, well acted, fits the storyperfectly and what is most important it feels fresh and original. It isdifferent from the other Thor and Marvel movies and stands firmly onits own while still being a bridge to the culmination of the Marveluniverse. It's light tone is in my opinion a good set up for the finalchapters of the Marvel universe which are no doubt going to be muchdarker and more dramatic. But make no mistake Thor Ragnarok is aserious movie with a thin layer of drama and darkness as well. It's notperfect but it's flaws are tiny and barely noticeable when compared tothe big picture. Without a doubt in my top 3 Marvel movies for now.
