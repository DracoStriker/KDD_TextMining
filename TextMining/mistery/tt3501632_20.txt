This movie is fantastic. The colors, the vibe, the humor, the action,it just makes me want to see it again. Marvel nailed it once more, tobe honest this is even better than guardians of the galaxy.And Korg, my god whoever came up with the idea for this character is acomedic genius.The only thing I think is weird is the look of Hulk, something justlooks weird about him, he looks too plastic/CGI or something.I definitely would recommend this movie, great entertainment!
