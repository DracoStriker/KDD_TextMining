With the third Thor movie called "Ragnarok" which means the apocalypse,you would think it would be the darkest entry in the saga yet. Not so!By bringing in Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director who brings in hisspecial vision and kiwi humour into the mix, this an amazing,kaleidoscopic, gut-bustlingly hilarious ride. Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster is wonderfully funny, Tessa Thompsonas Valkerie, a hard-drinking Asgardian warrior is a total breath offresh air and Korg (played by the director) is just as eccentricallywicked as Rocket Racoon. The Age of Ultron got criticized by some for including a bar scenewhere the Avengers have fun with Thor's hammer. But to be honest, I'dalways welcome the Avengers having a good old time, making jokes,bantering and insulting each other in the process.Doctor Strange makes an appearance, which is amazing. He takes his jobas the Sanctorum's gate-keeper very seriously and has no time forLoki's mischief. A very welcome change indeed in these troubled times.
