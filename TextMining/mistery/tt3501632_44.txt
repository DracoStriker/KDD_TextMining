I watched this movie on second biggest screen in the country (vue printworks Manchester) on release the day and boy i was glad.Thor Ragnaroknot only takes you to the most fun and entertaining ride in Thorfranchise but its on par with The Avengers in that aspect.It is avisual spectacle with its amazing colours and some of the scenes willmake you feel privileged been born at this age of time.Its story isderived from few comics and is really narrated perfectly with the rightpushes at right times.Hela is played perfectly by Cate Blanchett. Ireally enjoyed her delivery with tone she used it was perfect.Hemsworthas Thor was awesome and so was Mark Raffulo as hulk and Hiddlstone asLoki, all the other side characters did a good job but the icing onthis cake was Taika Waititi as Korg, was hilarious.I had this feelingto compare this to rest of the top top superhero movies and Nolan'sbatman trilogy comes to mind.I would put it this way if you are not aChristopher Nolan and make movies like batman into crime dramas bywhich i mean giving them a serious look weather the world is ending ornot you can be Taika Waititi and make them as much fun and entertainingas Thor Ragnork. Its Entertainment galore go treat yourself.
