This is the third standalone Marvel 'Thor' film, a swashbucklingsuperhero fantasy that continues directly after where 'The Dark World'ends. The premise is that Asgard is in peril, Thor's objective is toprevent the destruction of his home planet. This film introduces the villain 'Hela', she is the Goddess of Death,she is also Thor's sister, who has been in exile for many years andappears to be a very powerful character, possibly more powerful thanThor! During a particularly colourful action sequence, Thor is transported toa remote 'dump' of a world, on the other side of the Universe, thisplanet is full of rubbish and discarded people and is ruled by theweirdo 'Grandmaster' outstandingly played by Jeff Goldblum. In orderfor Thor to get back, he first needs to beat the champion gladiator,who happens to be the 'HULK'. This is also the point where we'reintroduced to another excellent show stealing character, 'Korg', voicedby the director Taika.The entire film is full of relentless adult comedy sketches andhumorous dialogue, which was inspired by the humour and success ofGuardians of the Galaxy. With a great soundtrack, this is a hugely entertaining film thatbalances humor with drama. Highly recommended.
