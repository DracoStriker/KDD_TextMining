I don't know what s wrong with some people.This movie had nothingagainst Europeans or Europe culture/history.Cause if it had,then thiswouldn't be approved by European critics.Anyway,this movie and the Logan are the grand jewels of comic bookmovies of this year.Logan was deep,emotional,brutal with intriguingstory.Thor is pure epicness,filled with action and the comedy side fitsperfectly to tone of the movie.From the trailer I thought Guardians ofthe Galaxy will have lots of cringe jokes and cheesy moments but theyused the comedy perfectly.Same can be said for Thor 3 too.They managedto have an impact on the audience with sentimental stuffs,at the sametime they made us laugh in right places. This movie has already gottenitself carved to my memory.A memorable movie for me.Just like darkknight,Logan and guardians of the galaxy 1.
