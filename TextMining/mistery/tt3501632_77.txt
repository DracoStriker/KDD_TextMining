Potential spoilers:Thor: Regnarok is possibly the most entertaining film I've seen allyear. It has high quality action, great comedy and a very very goodstory line for once. Unlike be other Thor movies which were prettypoor, this one is absolutely fantastic! I cannot praise this movieenough! I was in stitches for most of the film, as was the rest of thecinema audience. The character 'Korg' is a sensationally funnycharacter and one to look out for; those one liners are amazing. Truly a great movie with excellent content, and overshadows bothprevious movies. I'd you don't see this movie, you will really bemissing out! Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see how much content the Hulk had.He wasn't just a side character for this movie which I expected
