Out of the MCU films, I felt that the first two Thor films were amongthe weaker installments. They took them a little too seriously and theywere a tad grandiose, full of Shakespearean overtones.This film goes in a whole new direction though. The humour throughoutis pitch perfect and there is much-needed levity over the course of themotion picture. The lack of Natalie Portman and her scientist friendsis a massive bonus and allows the story to flow rather than beingbogged down with Thor's forced fish-out-of-water/romance story from theprevious two films.Cate Blanchett comes to the forefront as Hela, the villain of thepiece, hell bent on conquering Asgard. Blanchett is having the time ofher life portraying the malevolent Goddess of Death. Thor and Loki mustput aside their differences and try to stop her. Hemsworth andHiddleston are on top form as ever and the added humour makes theirdynamic more enjoyable.They end up getting sidetracked and captured by Jeff Goldblum, playingthe Grandmaster (but really it's Goldblum playing himself) who forcesThor into fighting Hulk/Banner in a Colosseum-like arena. Thor gainsthe trust of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and from there, it's yourclassic good fights evil scenario.Taika Waititi pulls out all the stops here, as director, adding a lotof charm and fun to the film. The set design and overall aesthetic isalso great as well, a real '80s neon feel. And the music...the musicwas brilliant! Who would've thought that the composer for Rugrats woulddeliver such an awesome soundtrack!I left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Great return to form forthe God of Thunder!!!
