I will keep it brief; this movie was akin to some cult action/superheromovies from 80s like Flash Gordon with the pace, kind of imagery ithad, the balance of action/interaction in a humour loaded format,choice of tracks in OST and the way said music is capitalized in themovie.I am a middle aged person who loved Flash Gordon back in days andRagnarok was almost a nostalgic experience for me. I enjoyed mostchoices in the movie even the ones that are most criticized such aseasy discarding of Fandrall and Volstagg. For me those simply were usedas highlighters of how Hela is in a league of her own that's simplybeyond challenge. The ease they let people perish (akin to hawkmencharge in Flash Gordon) along disco music was also one of the factorswhere I enjoyed that nostalgic fan ride.
