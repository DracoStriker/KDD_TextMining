Yup, it's a great movie. Best movie I've seen for a very long timebecause most movies today are copies, boring and pathetic. Sit back andrelax for a good time. If I had any complaints at all which is not abig deal I thought Tessa Thompson should not be in the film. Feels morelike a miscast, has a big part of the film, and cheesy. I think someoneelse could of done a way better job but it's not a big deal.
