I'll say it again. This lord of thunder movie is ridiculouslymarvelous, you know, because it's Marvel? OK I know where the door is.But before I get out, let me add a couple of things.I don't remember much, but as far as I can tell, this is a second superheroes movies that the soundtrack really hit the spot, Led Zeppelin'sImmigrant song is kick ass, and its really help to create perfectatmosphere while Thor kicking ass.This movie do provide more color than usual, literally, and throw a lotof comedies, showing that it's okay for a big scary dude to act dork,I'm looking at you Hulk, you're kinda cute there, you too lord of...err, god of thunder. Thor, we still like you even though you're not astrongest Avengers (that's what quinn jet says).All in all, this movie is gooood. There, 'nuf said, I'm out of here,maybe to watch it again. Or maybe later, when I'm sure I can pick agood position, rather than forced to take the last available chair.
