I saw this film at the Beckenham Odeon in London. The beginning of thisfilm was as impactful as the bullet-time opening of Swordfish. So thatset the movie off at with very high expectation indeed. Hela's part inthe story was as expected, and nothing changed from the trailers. She'svery powerful, and also very single-minded. Hulk's treatment in thefilm was in two parts - when he was the Hulk, he was a star, but whenhe was not hulk, he was a bit part player. I'm not sure I liked how hisrole was handled in the film, but I suppose anymore exposure of theHulk, would have taken the shine off Thor himself. So maybe itsunderstandable. I personally felt that more could have been made of theHulk's character. What did make the film stand out though was thecomedy. It was very unexpected, and also brilliantly done! Along theway, Thor meets a minor gladiator, who turns out to be the funniest guyever! You'll have to see for yourself, but his deadpan delivery turnsthe film almost into a comedy, every time he's on the screen! Thebattle scenes were good, but not to the level of LOTR, for scope andspectacle. I enjoyed it, but I feel that it fell just a little bitshort of the standard that Wonder Woman delivered. But it did set upthe forthcoming space-based Marvel films very well (Black Panther wasnot referenced).
