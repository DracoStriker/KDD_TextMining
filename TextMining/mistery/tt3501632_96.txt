"Asgard is not a place, it's a people." Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor: Ragnarok is about saving a homeland, Asgard, but eventually notthe physical land. It's all about the people, a gentle allusion to theplight today of immigrants who have become travelers while bringinghome with them. People leaving in a space ship like an ark carry theBiblical heft and a swashbuckling sci-fi adventure.So the redeeming element of these heroic films from Marvel, and DC forthat matter, is the cultural mash up that reflects our civilization'sabiding interest in how we can become better than we are, i.e.,becoming super heroes, and yet retain the sweet, flawed humanity wewere meant to be. The pervasive humor in quips and self deprecation isa welcome humane ingredient and a sign that the super hero genre ismaturing.In Thor :Ragnorak, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is not just ahemmer-throwing, muscle bound cutie; he is a young man dealing with thedeath of his father, Odin; the mischief of his brother, Loki (TomHiddleston); and the devastating power of his sister, Hela (CateBlanchett), the goddess of death. A bit more severe than yours and myfamilies, but in a figurative way, just the same with its challengingrelationships that sometime seem bloody.Although these space citizens are years ahead of us, they still fightwith broadswords and machine guns, confirming our cultural awarenessthat battles will never really be different because they reside in themind. From Greeks through now, we have been fascinated by our highs andlows, our greatness and our flaws, be it in Oedipus Rex or WillyLowman.There will always be a place for hubris in our theater and films, andalthough the time and technology may differ, we still love and deploreour bloodlines as we work our way to dusty death. This Thor carries toomany explosions for my taste, but the sociological thunderstorms aresatisfyingly entertaining and sometimes downright allegorical.
