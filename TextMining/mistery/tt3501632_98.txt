I saw many people in the internet complaining about the "fun vibe" ofthe movie. Well, guys, IT'S A MARVEL MOVIE! What the heck are youexpecting?! The trailer sell me a fun movie, and this was exactly whatI receive. Didn't you?Look, I'm a really critical about the excess of jokes in the Marvelmovies, I really believe that in some of them it doesn't work at all(like Civil War, Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange). But here in Ragnarokfor me was a improve, comparing with the other Thor movies (the firstone suck, and the second it's fun, but not that much too).Chris Hemsworth has amazing comic skills (way better than his"dramatic" ones), Mark Rufallo is great too, Tom Hiddleston, etc etc(you get it, the cast is great).The movie isn't a master piece (like Joss Whedon said), far away fromthat, they bet on the save (again), but this time works. Cate Blanchettis F#CKING INCREDIBLE on the movie! And that is a improve when youthink in the MCU (you know... the majority of the villains in themovies suck). So, in short, for me Ragnarok is another very entertaining, fun, andwell done Marvel movie. Doesn't will win an Oscar or something, butit's good, and mainly, a lot better than the first two.
