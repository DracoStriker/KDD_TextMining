This is a classic example of Hollywood culture of trying to force asequel even though you have no thought of idea.When I see the movie it seems that someone forced the writers to do arush job just because a sequel had to be made.All characters look clichéd and boring. There is nothing new from acharacter perspective. The movie manages to be unnecessarily emotionaland most events in the story look like filers which are totallyunrelated to the story.They totally fail to live the magic of the original cars movie. Thisone is very disappointing and just outright boring. all i wish that they had left the original alone and not made thissequel.
