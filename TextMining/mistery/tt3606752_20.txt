This movie had no dimension beyond Lightning McQueen trying to win onemore race only to never actually race one more race. The othercharacters of the original movie make scarce appearance, and webasically spend the whole movie watching Lightning McQueen get ready torace the final big race but then never actually race the big final race(because he "passes the torch" to this flat and uninteresting new racercar called Cruz Ramirez who is about as interesting as a 1982 ToyotaCorolla).Doc Hudson is nowhere to be found, and without explanation, and themovie has no other plot line to speak of. There is also little humor tospeak of, and the only good thing I can say about this snorefest isthat it was better than Cars 2. Wait, no, actually this was the worstof the three cars movies.Who does Disney get to write these lame scripts? A 12-year old?Save your money and wait until this atrocity comes out on DVD if youreally want to waste two hours of your life.
