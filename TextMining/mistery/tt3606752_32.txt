This is the proof that when you delay a movie that everyone was waitingfor (Incredibles 2) to force one that no one wanted.Cars 3 is mediocre and I never believed in their success. Maybe myreview is overshadowed by my anger with their decision with Incridibles2. But like many pointed this is animated movie, they don't need toage. That was a bad decision although they did that call for Cars 2 andpeople let it slip and they thought let do it again.
