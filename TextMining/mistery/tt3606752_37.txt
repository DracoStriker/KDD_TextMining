I have been a big Pixar fan ever since the first Toy Story. I have seenalmost all the Pixar movies and I can say this is their worst movieafter The Good dinosaur... and unfortunately dinosaurs and cars areprobably my son's favorite objects and I was just a bit disappointedthey couldn't get them right. I don't have anything more to say exceptgraphics is the usual great quality from all Pixar movies but it stillhasn't kept me from falling asleep. Overall, a poor movie by Pixar 'slofty standard but if u lower your expectation you might enjoy it.
