With a Toy Story 3-esque story of accepting change and moving on Cars 3could have been a great and truly touching movie. However, instead of an endearing, late-in-life coming of age tale oflearning to gracefully grow into the next stage life has to offer,we're left with a film who's ultimate morale is that it only takes oneinexcusably bad trainer to firebomb a decorated career and p*** on theburning ash remains.Making it worse is that the character's utter incompetence at meetingthe needs of her client or fulfilling her most basic job functions isoverlooked due to her unprofessional, gendered emotionalism. The viewer is left with the lingering suspicion and bad taste thatLightning McQueen could have, if not won, then at least ended with afight, rather than the close to cop-out we're treated with, if onlyhe'd dumped the film's most-annoying character on the side of the roadand never looked back. Ultimately, the film is watchable and entertaining in parts, butcripples itself from being truly memorable.
