I have watched Cars 1 more than hundred times along with my son. Willbe able to watch again without getting bored. But the Cars 2 not livingup the expectation. But Cars 3, is just plain, boring and lame. Thedialogues and story line are no way in line with the Cars 1 level. Andthe climax (making McQueen out and replaced by another car, really?)made it worse. Hope they will end this series now.
