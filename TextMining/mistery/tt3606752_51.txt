this movie was actually OK not as bad as i thought and when i saw thetrailer i thought it was going to be terrible but it wasn't that badthis movie was boring most of the time. the writing was OK thought.even thought it was really slow paced i could still understand thepilot, point, and message in this film. the characters weren't thatgreat either because they didn't feel original enough. overall thismovie is not original. the jokes weren't funny either. overall a OKmovie but could of been way better. it had a few good qualities but alot of bad ones. this movie needs much more work.
