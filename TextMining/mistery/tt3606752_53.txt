Cars 3The upside to living in a world ruled by sentient vehicles is ampleparking.Mind you, the articulate autos in this 3-D animated movie refer toparking spaces as condos.Weathered race veteran Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is sent to thescrap heap when tech-savvy newcomer Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer) joinsthe Piston Cup race circuit and bests all of his lap records.While he is on the mend Lightning takes his new trainer Cruz Ramirez(Cristela Alonzo) under his wing and, instead, helps her achieve herown racing aspirations; with a little help from a mysterious mechanic(Chris Cooper).Although the animation in this second sequel is superlative, its sadstoryline spins its tires on long bouts of boring dialogue with highspeed racing only bookending its PC narrative. Moreover, the voice workfeels uninspired by the laugh-free script. Besides, even self-driving cars find NASCAR to be completely boring. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca
