I had a difficult time getting emotionally attached to the characters,something any good Pixar film would easily do. I'm guessing that it'sprobably because of the unwritten, but still unbroken social barrierbetween cars and humans, wherein I am unable to feel sympathy for acar. I was more emotionally affected by the animated short presentedbefore the film, titled "Lou", in which the main character was anamalgamation of lost toys; to be fair, though, I did very much enjoythe short.As well, I felt the character of Cruz was created as a contrived socialcommentary on today's youth, those very much attached to technology,allegedly unable to handle the outside world as if they were trapped inthe matrix or something. Her initial ineptitude at outdoor racing mademe believe that she was written in by my self-righteous gramma.
