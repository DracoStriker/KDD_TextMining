Let me just say this, I am NOT a huge fan of the sentient vehicleseries. Cars 1 was fine, Cars 2 was borderline terrible, Planes wasboring and Planes 2 was god awful. And while this movie is better thanboth Planes movies and Cars 2 to some extent, it still fails on manylevels. I won't spoil anything but lets just say that even though itisn't boring, it is still a lousy movie and doesn't deserve the 7.2 outof 10 IMDb has given it. It didn't improve much over Cars 2. This wassimply a waste of Pixar's time and money. I would've been OK with it ifit was DisneyToon making it (they're the people responsible for Planes1 and 2) because then I would have no reason to see it. But since Pixarmade it I thought it would be something of decent quality. However itfails on many levels and I would not recommend it at all. If you likethe sentient vehicle movie series regardless of quality then fine, seeit. But be prepared for a movie that has no saving grace other than thefact that the animation is good. The animation is what earned thismovie 4 stars in my book. That's the only thing good about it.
