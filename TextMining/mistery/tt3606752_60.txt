First of all, let me get this out of my system: I've seen many 1-2stars reviews out there. While I understand why those people are upsetI think 1/10 is way too low. The movie isn't inherently bad, it's not adisastrous mess of burning oil like some reviewers make it to look. Butit's not great either.The movie is lighthearted, easy to chew and fun for the most part. Iwouldn't expect more from a cartoons movie. But this is Pixar so ofcourse I expected more.I've got three major problems with this movie. First, the newcharacters are extremely flat and one-dimensional. The "new" youngercars are just jerks (all of them), there's no reason for them to behavelike they behave but because they're the "antagonists" of the movie weneed to feel mad at them I guess. So they're flat-out pretentious withzero background. The new sidekick of Lightning is also a completelybasic character with an extremely contrived background story. Second, the third act feels forced and unbelievably illogical (and yesI know I'm talking about a movie with talking cars). I can't reallyexplain this point without spoiling anything but let's say the endisn't loyal to the movie's protagonist and the end is wrapped up in avery forced manner.Third, the Mary Sue of the movie. I really don't care about overpoweredfemale characters, I didn't even care about Rey in Star Wars. I don'tcare! But this new female sidekick of Lightning McQueen is just tooMary Sue to be true. Again I don't want to give away anything but I'mtired of that "you got something that you didn't know and now you're ahero", that's BS.So, it's a fun flick but many levels below the old good Pixar.
