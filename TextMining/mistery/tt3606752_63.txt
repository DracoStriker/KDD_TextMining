Champion Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) faces new competition fromarrogant hi-tech rookie Jackson Storm. His friends are forced intoretirement and replaced by the new generation of racers. He startslosing to Storm and a final crash ends his failing season. With the newseason approaching, he faces self-doubt and the press expects hisretirement. He gets new owner Sterling and new trainer Cruz Ramirez.It's a good idea for Rocky, I mean Lightning, to find new meaning intraining a young replacement. At least, that should have been thismovie. It plays around with the idea and finally ends up there but ittakes its time. In the meanwhile, Lightning continues to be obsessedwith himself. It's a little problematic that he doesn't grow from movieto movie. Sterling should have started from the beginning as a biggervillain. Cruz's journey is a little rocky. Sometimes, she's gung-ho asa trainer but other times, she's completely scared. I look forward tohave Lightning training new whippersnappers in future sequels. Thisidea could have achieved its goal a little better.
