I think a lot of people have been criticising Disney too harshly forthe twist in this movie. While I agree that at first glance it sends amixed message to viewers especially with regard to ***SPOILER***lightning giving up on the premise of the trailer. at a deeper viewingthis film is in fact a brilliant morale lesson for all ages. Now mostreviewers here who have given such bad scores expected a formula thatlightning would just overcome the inevitable. But really, this isactually a shallow plot device. Age is a fact of life, you cannot keepwinning forever, and you are a fool if you think otherwise. That is thelesson, lightning did beat storm, by doing what most racers could not,giving an opportunity to a bright racer who never gave themselves achance. Accepting age and channeling all your victories, all yourlife's lessons, all the skills and experiences into another throughteaching is the most unbeatable things anyone can do. Doc realised itand so finally did Lightning. If you, the viewer can accept that humbling truth yourself you will notbe disappointed by Cars 3. There's a whole lot more to racing than justwinning after all. Pixar have done a wonderful job, my only criticismis that they didn't find some way to bring Doc back. By the way, my sonloved this film, just as much as the first.
