I absolutely loved this movie. I give it a 10/10 because I could relateto it and I thought it was inspiring. I actually was able to foreshadowwhat was going to happen next. I could really relate to Cruz R. She hada similar story to mine except she wasn't a failure. I recommend thismovie, it's great.
