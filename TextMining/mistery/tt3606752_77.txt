***This review may contain spoilers*** So apparently a lot of peoplecomplaining about the movie, have no basic comprehension skills or anyunderstanding of how to explain concepts to their kids. They just wanttheir kids to see that you can win no matter what and even if you getold you will still always be the best.A lot of people are saying he was defeatist and ended up retiring. No.McQueen was on his way to winning the race and sacrificed his chance inorder to give another car, who he saw potential in, the chance of alifetime to try something they were good at. Secondly since he won therace by default through the other car, he is still able to and admitsthat he will continue racing.Also for the people going on and on about it being a female car. Whocares dude, it could have been a tiny boy car too. The plot would stillhave made the same point. Also they are cars.Moral of the story: Even at your best, sometimes you will still facehardships and others may end up being better than you. The best you cando is to learn, adapt and be open and supportive to others who may beequally as good. It is about learning how to handle competition and howto stay motivated and accepting of others when you are no longer atyour peak.It teaches you how to stay classy and how to change and grow as ahuman. Not just finding a fancy new trick to win once again. It wouldhave been more unrealistic if he just wins no matter what and no onecan ever defeat him even in old age. I thought it was a brilliantlearning experience for a child and considering so many millennials aregoing into depression because they are only now finding out that ''youcan't be whatever you want to be and win'', I would say we should behaving more movies teaching our kids this.
