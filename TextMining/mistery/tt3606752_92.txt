I was quite excited for this film. This film had a lot of expectationsto live up to so the pressure was kind of high for the makers. Buthonestly, I think they nailed it. *SPOILER*I really love how this movie links to Cars 1 (in contrast to Cars 2).Cars 1 was probably my youth (now I'm 14) so I really loved that!The story is great. The older ones (McQueen and his friends) aregetting blown away by new racers, so he has to make a comeback, yes.And that's where everybody gets to hate McQueen. I think the decisionof McQueen becoming coach was a great idea. Well, actually he said hecontinued racing or I took that the wrong way, but anyway, it's good toencourage hard decision you have to make. That's what this movie wasall about in my perspective.I loved this and I was completely blown away by the final scenes but itwas amazing! All the memories!
