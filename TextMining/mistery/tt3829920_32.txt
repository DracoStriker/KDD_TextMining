A "hotshot" is a firefighter whose specialty is working the front linesof a forest fire. And the new motion picture "Only the Brave" is aboutthe Granite Mountain Hotshots, an elite crew of forest firefightersfrom Prescott, Arizona who established a remarkable record of successin their specialty but collided with fate and tragedy during Arizona'sYarnell Hill Fire in June of 2013.Written by Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer and directed by JosephKosinski, "Only the Brave" is one biographical picture which doesn'tgild the lily, or idealize the subject of the drama. The firefighters depicted in the movie are human, and have flaws andweaknesses: Three of the leading characters are recovering substanceabusers, and some of the picture's best acting is screamed betweenactors Josh Brolin and Jennifer Connelly, playing the Hotshots'commanding officer and his spirited and independent wife.If you're unfamiliar with the story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots,"Only the Brave" is a genuinely effective real-life adventure picturewhich does justice to not only that famed battalion but also tofirefighters and emergency responders everywhere. And even if you already know the story, the picture works as a tributeto the people who place themselves between us and danger, and thefamilies who support them.
