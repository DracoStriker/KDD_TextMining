I saw "Only the Brave", starring Josh Brolin-Everest, True Grit_2010;Jennifer Connelly-Noah, The Rocketeer; Jeff Bridges-Kingsman:The GoldenCircle, True Grit_2010 and Miles Teller-War Dogs, Footloose_2011. Thismovie is based on a true story about 19 firefighters that lost theirlives fighting a forest blaze in 2013. They were called the GraniteMountain Hot Shots-there were other Hot Shot teams across the countrybut they were the only certified Hot Shot team to work for amunicipality. The fire was headed towards Yarnell, Arizona when thetragedy happened. Josh was the leader of the team and Jennifer playshis wife, who worries everyday that he goes to work. The team'spersonal lives are shown as a tight nit family-they would do anythingfor each other. Their main jobs were to go into blazing fires-when mostpeople are running in the opposite direction-and save lives. Jeff isJosh's boss and Miles is the last recruit to join the team. Out of the20 man team, only 1 survived. It is a heroic and emotional story. FYI:I do remember hearing some good music in the soundtrack; Metallica,Pearl Jam, ZZ Top and AC/DC-and they actually played my favorite AC/DCsong-and Jeff Bridges even sings a song on stage, as his character. Asthe end credits role, pictures and names of the the actual Hot Shotsare shown. It's rated "PG-13" for drug use, language and sexualcontent-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. Ienjoyed it-bring some tissues-and would buy it on DVD.
