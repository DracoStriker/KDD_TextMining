This starts out like a 20 min music video with this kid singing anddancing through the streets, turns into a bank robber movie, then adull love story, then into a free for all.The amount of "instant police" in this is ridiculous, no matter wherethey run there is another cop. The supposed "brains" of the outfithires total screw ups and maniacs to pull off the simplest robberies.At one point they go to get a ton of guns to rob a post office?? Thewhole premise is that the kid somehow owes Spacey money but when hepays up he is not allowed to get out. The ending is over the topstupid. The use of constant music is fun at first but becomes tedious.
