I was able to watch Baby Driver during an advanced screening last weekand and yes it's as amazing as the critics say it is. The way it usesthe music is just so great. It's so different from all the othermovies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it:this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hardto please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this.And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he wasabout this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also seriouswhen it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll behonest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the secondtime I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theatersI would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, itreminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want topunch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality Ithink it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it'sdefinitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't wantto overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is myfavorite Edgar Wright movie. I'll be shocked if this doesn't appear onmany 'Best of the Year' lists in December, at least I already knowit'll be on mine.
