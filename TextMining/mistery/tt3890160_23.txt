I love this action movie! The story negatively expresses the goodnessand genuineness of a man. Audiences are quite impressed with Baby'sgoodness which showed through series of mistakes during his takingdriver role in bank robbery business. Doc is a business agent for bank robbery who hired by unknown socialforces who seek illegal benefits by exploiting thugs. Kevin Spacey ismy favorite actor and he also did great job for this role. His actingis sensitive for expressing humanism via dark side of human race. Docis not a completely brutal guy for Baby even when Baby recorded everyconversation among thugs and make it into musics. Socially disabled Baby's encounter with waitress Debora is everyone'sdream! Debora and bank victims who saved by Baby testimonies hisgoodness at the court in the last sequence. Then, Baby has happy endingafter released from jail. Audiences accepted the happy ending! The story is humanistic! Bank robbery driver Baby meets beautifulwaitress Debora. And his illegal acts risk and threaten his belovedpeople gradually , and thugs turned against him. It is a good film! 10 out of 10!
