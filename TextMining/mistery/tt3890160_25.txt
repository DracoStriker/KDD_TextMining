Thanks to student edge i was given the chance to see the film early,having seen amazing reviews from its screening at SXSW, i went in withincredibly high expectations. Coming out, those expectations stillmanaged to be exceeded.Edgar Wright directed the sh1t out of this movie. Everything is filmedbeautifully, especially the incredible action scenes and one- takes.The acting is superb, the film balanced out the drama and comedicelements extremely well, and the plot was immensely well developed andentertaining, the characters are rich and engrossing, with thechemistry between Ansel Elgort and Lily James being the stand out partof this film for me, lastly i was very skeptical at the beginning ofthe film regarding the dominating presence of the soundtrack throughoutthe movie, but the killer soundtrack was fun, lively and bloody joyful,and blended into the plot seamlessly , it became its own character inthe film and definitely brought a smile to my face.Go into this movie knowing as little as you can, this is an experiencelike no other.
