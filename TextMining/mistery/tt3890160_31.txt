I knew very little about this movie coming into it except that JamieFoxx was in it. Even though I loved Jamie Foxx in Django Unchained andRay, I was still unsure if I should see it. When I asked the film crewabout the movie, the young woman said it is a ton like Need-For-Speed.I really enjoyed this movie. The conflict had to deal with paying debtwhich everyone has to deal with and finding love which I am looking for(corny but who does not want love). The ending of the movie, acting,and soundtrack are the main highlights of this movie, which makes it atriple- threat in Hollywood.
