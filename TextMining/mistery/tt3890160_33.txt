Edgar Wright's newest film captures everything you can possibly loveabout going to the movies. It's filled with wonderful characters, greatcar chases, enough style for a dozen cool flicks, and yes, a soundtrackthat is better than sex. While using a familiar story template (theDriver & Drive), Wright completely makes it his own, infusing it withhis love for music and his film geekiness. Wright has a perfectfilmography at this point and definitely deserves to be ranked as oneof the finest directors of the past 20 years. This may be his bestmovie yet.The cast is note perfect, the only downside is that Jon Bernthal's roleis almost more of a cameo (considering the top billing). Ansel Elgortis wonderful as Baby, bringing an instant likability and purity to thecharacter. The supporting cast is equally great with Jon Hamm, JamieFoxx, and Eiza Gonzalez as the standouts. The scenes between all threeof them contain the most electricity and tension.The car chases are brilliantly shot, eschewing the dull over-the-topsilliness of the Fast & Furious franchise for something much moregrounded and much more exciting. The lack of special effects keeps upthe tension with actual stunt driving, continuing the good trend ofrecent actions films going back to doing things for real, showing anunderstanding of the genre.Usually, I try to not let myself get too hyped about a new film comingout, but this is the exception. I can't remember the last time I hadthis much pure fun at the movies and all of you need to see it. I waslucky enough to get into an advanced screening and I almost regret it:waiting two months before I can see it again is unbearable torture.
