It's one of the best-shot car movies I've seen in a long time. It isalso very entertaining, although for the end it gets much worse. If youwant to have fun watching well-shot races and not with infiniteassembly plans this is the movie. I do not like it when it starts toexplain things in the end, or how it becomes beautiful.The actors are pretty good for an action movie.What I do not like is that the music is very poorly integrated. Thereare times when you do vibrate with the music that sounds, but in thepart of the film that is dedicated to explaining the songs and see thatit is a short time, but I get a lot out of the movie.I think he's trying to be too funny and he's superimposed. He is forcedwhen Ansel tries to look great and that's enough for me.It has a good picture, but it's not great. The outdoor part is toonatural, it's not cinemaThe address changes at times. Just like the races are very well shot,then for the end, it starts to roll based on a lot of editing and itspoils it. Do not bore the film, the other way around, it'sentertaining, but it's not a great movie, it's a movie to entertain.Enjoy the sequences of cars and forget about the rest
