The only thing I can say for sure about Baby Driver is that this movieis highly overrated. It certainly doesn't deserve such a high rating asit does now on here. It's an easy to watch action movie but not thebest one in this genre. The plot isn't difficult to understand and itisn't that bad either but the characters are what brings this moviedown. Too much have-you-see-me characters just don't do any good to themovie. I really doubt criminals and bank robbers would act like they dobefore a heist. It would be for sure a disaster every time. KevinSpacey is the big name in Baby Driver but don't watch this movie to seehim in action. He did much better movies than this one. The rest of thecast can clearly act but it's just their ridiculous characters thatmakes this just an average action movie.
