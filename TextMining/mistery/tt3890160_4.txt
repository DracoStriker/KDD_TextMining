This thing is getting similar ratings on IMDb and Rotten to HEAT forChrist's sake. HEAT? This movie was deeply flawed. I only stayed to theend to see how bad it could get - its MST3K riffable bad. Its got a ton of plot holes. I almost want to pick it apart like I didGhostbusters 2016. But I cant. Its not worth the energy. Please beforegoing to pay for this in the theater think about if you would like aversion of the already bad Furious type movies with even more plotholes, choreographing gun fights to music added in and fairly badacting.Music is fair. I mean, its just not that great. Foxx and Spacey don'tlift and acting finger. The "villain" changes like 4 times. And the best getaway driver is the one who never has to exceed thespeed limit. This driver and his idiot crews get screwed every timeinto driving like maniacs from the police.I don't want to pee on Ansel Elgort's parade. Its not his fault. But tobe 95%/90% on rotten, and 8.3 here, and in the mid 80s on meta? ComeON. Movie tix are far too expensive to dupe people into seeing this. Itdoes seem like the rating system is being rigged for this.I wish Ansel well, and hope Ed Wright and the crew can put togetherbetter stuff but man, either this is the sign of the times or there isa fault in our reality simulator. Heat and Ronin destroy a movie like this. If you think this moviedeserves even half what say a movie like Heat or Ronin get you arementally ill.
