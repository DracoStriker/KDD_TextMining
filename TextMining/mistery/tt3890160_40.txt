'Baby Driver' was probably the movie I was most looking forward toseeing this year. The trailers looked awesome and with a director astalented as Edgar Wright at the helm, my expectations were high.Unfortunately, after a great start and a memorable opening sequence, itgradually falls away. The film is so obsessed with its style andappearance that it completely forgets to do what all movies aresupposed to - entertain.The plot is, in a word, rubbish. I can't believe Edgar Wright went fromthinking up something as brilliantly original as 'Shaun of the Dead'and 'Hot Fuzz' to a generic car chase action flick like 'Baby Driver'.If you take away the music, this film has already been done dozens oftimes before. The main character is also remarkably uninteresting. Idon't know if the actor is to blame here, but 'Baby' spends 90% of thefilm just standing there looking smug. I found the character boring anda bad rip-off of Ryan Gosling's intriguing character in 'Drive'.
