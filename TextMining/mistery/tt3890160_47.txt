Yes it was a heist plotted movie, that's no secret - but what separatesthis movie from some other heist flicks is it actually has an equalamount of character as it does action. I'm quite good at spottingpredictable moments but this movie didn't have many of those (if any),which was nice for a change. In short, basically it was like Fast & TheFurious, except it was good!
