*Plot*Without spoiling anything, the movie is about a young getaway driver,Baby (Ansel Elgort) who's parents were killed in a car accident. As aresult of this event, he damaged his hearing and therefore, constantlylistens to music to drown the humming noise in his ear. He is pressuredinto working for this kingpin (Kevin Spacey) and works as the driver ofa crew in a series of robberies. Baby meets this waitress named Debora(Lily James) and falls in love with her. Arguably, this was the weakestaspect of the movie. This is because there could have been moreemphasis on character development and the relationship between the two.Their relationship simply did not feel strong enough to justify thelife changing and threatening decisions Debora made in the final thirdof the movie. However, despite this the plot was exciting and thepacing was spot on. 8.5/10*Cinematography* Baby Driver was a beautifully executed movie and it was a fresh breathof originality. This film has Edgar Wright written all over it. Theaction sequences are smooth and easy to follow and the colorfulcinematography is gorgeous. Baby driver has the perfect blend of fastcuts and long shots which make the movie visually stunning. 10/10*Music*Baby Driver is an action musical. The music plays a huge role in thefilm and it is in perfect sync with all the shots and events that occurbefore us. One of the things that Baby Driver made me do is leave themovie theater desperate to listen to the entire music score and it isindeed a combination of a variety of different songs which perfectlysuit the style and plot of the movie itself. 10/10*Performances*Baby Driver employed a greatly talented cast in Kevin Spacey, AnselElgort, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Lily James and Eiza Gonzalez. As onewould expect the acting was fantastic from all of the cast members.10/10It is definitely worth the watch. Edgar Wright does not disappoint!
