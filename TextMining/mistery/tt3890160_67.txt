Let me begin with my assumption that I wasn't going to like this film,but the 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes made me curious, and I'm nowreally glad I watched.This is an Intense driving action film for both action and music fans.The story is of 'Baby', who is a teenager and the best getaway driverin the business, his quirk is he plays music continuously throughearplugs to cope with constant tinnitus following a childhood accident.Baby works for a crime boss, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey. Babyis the lucky charm and is used for every bank job or armed robbery.Baby meets a waitress who provides the romantic element and who shareshis passion for music. They fall in love and plan to run away together.But, of course, Baby has just one last job before he can leave thecrime world.The plot is very cleverly written, there's an excellent non-stopsoundtrack that coordinates the action and music, that is as much acharacter as any of the actors. The car chases are without any CGI,making them more realistic (like you're really in the car). Baby Driver is a must-see, highly recommended film that if you didn'tknow you might guess was directed by Tarantino.
