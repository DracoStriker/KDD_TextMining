Getaway driver Baby, relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack tobe the best in the game. After meeting Debora, the woman of his dreams, he sees a chance toditch his shady lifestyle and make a clean break. Forced into working for crime boss Doc, Baby must face the music as adoomed heist threatens his life, love and freedom......As well as being the single most original film to be made for amainstream audience in years. As well as being slotted firmly in theaction genre, this could also be classed as a non-diegetic musical,because almost every frame of film consists of a song that is suitablefor the events that are taking place in the film.Wright doesn't follow an atypical approach to the narrative, and attimes, the film can appear to be hyperactive, almost like an anthologypiece, but this only adds to the uniqueness of it all.Wright uses gunfire, footsteps, gun loading and finger tapping toaccompany the music, and whilst in someone else's hands, this couldpotentially ruin the momentum of the film, Wright effortlessly meldsDiegesis and non Diegesis into something that is borderline genius.Strangely, the film does remind me somewhat of La La Land, with theopening almost dance like, with the smogs lyrics strewn about the set,and the colour coded choreography when the couple are in theLaunderette, is almost dreamlike in its presentation.Foxx is a wonderful presence in this film, and after the awful'Sleepless' just goes to show that he is award worthy, and injects somemenace into his role. Hamm too is pretty menacing, but becomes a littletoo 'end of level bad guy' in the final act.Spacey is as Spacey does, he simply oozes cool with his lines, and headds something to the film that others possibly couldn't.In fact, apart the main couple, this film features one of the mostmenacing cast of characters in a film I've seen in a long time. Becausethey are not predictable, they are spontaneous, and I don't think itscoincidence that you feel like Baby is in grave danger throughout thefilm.It's so refreshing for a studio to show trust in something so leftfield, and hopefully the success of this will open the gates for moreoriginal films to be mainstream.
