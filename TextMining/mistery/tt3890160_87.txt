Baby Driver, a cool music designed film that starts of with a bang. Butafter a while the film seems to get into a slip of the casual''hollywood'' same old, same old. Comparing this to a film like''Overdriver'' or ''Transformers'' Baby Driver just doesn't keep up. Itwas a good try from Edgar Wright but hopefully he can get his gameright with the next instalment.
