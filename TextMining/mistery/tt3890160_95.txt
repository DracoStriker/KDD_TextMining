Baby is a young getaway driver, contracted to a master-criminal, Doc.Doc's specialty is armed robberies - he puts together teams for eachheist, with Baby being the only constant. Baby completes his last jobfor Doc and is now free. He sets about leading a normal life, getting alegitimate job and starting a relationship (with Debora). However, Docviews Baby as a sort of good luck charm, and, using threats ofviolence, pulls him back into the criminal world. With a particular jobin mind, Doc assembles his team. However, the other individuals areincompatible with each other, if not psychotic, and soon not only isBaby's life at risk but also Deborah's.A gritty, action-packed and entertaining drama from director EdgarWright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs the World). Goodscript, with some characters that Tarantino would be proud of. Goodaction scenes, largely involving cars. The car-action does get possiblytoo much screen time though, starting to resemble Fast & Furious aftera while (that's never a compliment...). Another negative is that it does feel too schmaltzy, especially theending, which is quite weak in comparison with the remainder of themovie. Ansel Elgort is also a bit irritating as Baby (though not asirritating as he was in The Fault In Our Stars). Comes across as a nerdtrying to be cool.Can't fault the supporting performances though. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm,Jamie Foxx and Lily James are great. Jamie Foxx is particularlyimpressive as the intense, paranoid, impulsive, psychotic Bats.
