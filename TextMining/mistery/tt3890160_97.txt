First of all I'm not usually attracted to this kind of flick... I'mmore a fan of dark 'who done it' crime dramas but I was pleasantlysurprised at how much I enjoyed it... maybe it just caught me in theright mood?This is one of those films that gets either fantastic or really lousyreviews & I always find myself drawn to those.I find a lot of the reviewers who gave it low scores may have missedthe point of the movie. Someone stated that it takes itself tooseriously & as far as I'm concerned it's not doing that at all. It'smore a spoof than anything else. Some of the sound editing was very well done in the way that the sfxsynced with the music. Sure that's been done before but it was veryeffective & besides, what hasn't been done before.The best way to observe this is to turn off your brain's analyticalmode, grab some popcorn & just enjoy it for what it is; a fun rollickabout a group of people who aren't very well suited to each other outon a crime spree.
