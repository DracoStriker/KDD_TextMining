I will only say damn... that's how I felt when it finally finished.Itis good action. Simple! Makes you wanna live the story. Makes youfeel alive. Bring good vibes... And feels real. It is like a XXIcentury Bonnie and Clide. If you have not seen it, go see it. If youare feeling down, go watch it... if you are feeling up go watch it too.
