To think I had second thoughts about even going to see this ! A perfect film in all ways suitable for all the family for children 8months to 80 years and beyond . A total delight . Cinema-photography was excellent, giving aninteresting nostalgic feel set in modern times , at times you felt youwere being transported back to your childhood in the 1950s - 1970s withmany aspects such as steam trains and Victorian architecture andprisons - the Hugh Grant Phoenix Buchanan character was almost as ifTerry Thomas had been reincarnated to play the role! Shots of Windsorgardens and the Shard juxtapositioned the tourist view of London oldand new . The theme of good versus evil reigned supreme throughout . Togetherwith love conquers all and community spirit . Michael Bond the authorsadly died in Paddington on the last day of filming never reaching theage of Aunt Sally but at 91 he lived a long life and left us with amasterpiece . The cast was absolutely superb - the animation top notch - you'd forgetthat Paddington is a bear as did the characters at times - watch thecredits right to the end for Hugh camping it up to the max . Superb - you'll love it Pad.A 10/10'
