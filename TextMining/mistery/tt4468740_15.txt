From the opening moments to the end credits this film is a fittingepitaph to the author Michael Bond. I can honestly say this is the best"children's" film I have seen since Mary Poppins when I was 6. Like avery good marmalade it is bitter sweet, with moments of comedy thatwill have tears of laughter running down your cheek and moments ofpathos that will do the same - a good thing I was in a darkened cinema.The animators are the star (Paddington) but special mention must bemade for Hugh Grant who throws everything at this Oscar worthy role(Don't leave before the end credits or you'll miss one of the bestmoments) and Brendan Gleeson is suitably menacing and lovable at thesame time.Spoiler Alert :- The film flashbacks to Peru when Paddington wasrescued by Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo from a fast flowing river. Whenyou see the quality of the animation of this scene you know you areseeing movie platinum. The pop up book that Paddington wants to buy andsend to Aunt Lucy for her Birthday present comes to life at theQuayside with Paddington welcoming his aunt to London and showing herthe sights - these scenes are inspired and worth the admission pricealone. When Paddington gets sent to prison for being wrongly accused ofstealing the pop up book his transformation of the prison and the chefNuckles McGinty (Gleeson) is amazing - and it all starts withmarmalade. There are too many other excellent scenes to mention butwhen Paddington has been cleared and released from prison and is backhome he goes to the front door to open it and at this point, thanks tofirst rate animation throughout, you will believe a bear can fly.
