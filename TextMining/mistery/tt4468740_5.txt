The first Paddington film was cleverly made but just wasn't longenough. This film however lasted longer and had way more to it whichmade it better. Phoenix as the villain was kind of better thanMillicent as he was more cunning. Knuckles was a great addition, howyou couldn't like him is just wrong, if you like Knuckles The Echidnathen you'll like Knuckles McGinty. Mr Curry could have done more although they gave Mr Gruber a moredominant role like in the books. The scenes were mainly funny. Judy wasattractive like in the last film but three years' film difference canemphasize how much actors can change, especially Johnathan and Judy.The prison bit was a bit like Muppets Most Wanted as Paddingtonbefriends his cell mates and then they start to enjoy themselves andthen at the end they help his escape, only difference is that some ofthem join him. Overall a 9/10 for this film. Can't wait for Paddington3.
