This film is an instant classic. There were many cases of brilliantcasting and contributory insertion of unique versions of traditionalChristmas songs. This film should be avoided by those that abhor thenotion of Christianity. I have been bored by most Hollywood films since1990. It was very nice to not be completely bored out of my mind eightminutes into the story.
