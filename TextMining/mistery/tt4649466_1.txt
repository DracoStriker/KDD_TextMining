Why is it that so many fun, inspired originals are followed by suchlame, poorly written (and juvenile) sequels? The first one was a hugely entertaining spy flick with some comedy init to be sure, but this one puts the accent on the comedy, and isimpossible to take seriously whatsoever. This would not have reallybeen an issue if it was genuinely funny; but instead of wit and cleverwordplay, we are 'treated' to an abundance of uninspired, vulgar andchildish humour. Elton John repeatedly dropping the F-Bomb (Please,don't go on), a attractive woman asking someone to urinate on her (Ican't stop laughing), or an old man stating that he has just soiledhimself (Stop, my sides are hurting). Actually, my head hurt aftersitting through 141 minutes of this. (Well over half an hour too long).I recommend waiting for Netflix.
