Well, previous movie was a man being born to wear tuxedo, this movie isman that has no idea how to wear tuxedo, but owns one.I expected that part 2 will be worse, but this movie is a disaster.If you expect human body being turned into hamburger and then eaten,which really happens in movie (!!!) then go, but otherwise, big NO. Disappointment.
