Extremely disappointed. I enjoyed the first Kingsman film a lot. OKthere were parts of it that were very silly, but it was very well doneand I liked the style and feel of the film. I've seen it a couple oftimes. The second one is extremely silly. More silly than a very sillything. The action is so OTT that it just made me laugh. Julianne Mooreas the villain was about as terrifying as a labradoodle puppy. PedroPascal (who I loved in GoT) is just completely unbelievable. As isChanning Tatum. There are good performances - as always, Jeff Bridgesis entertaining, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Taron Egerton, Halle Berry,Hanna Elstrom and Emily Watson (fantastic cast isn't it!) are allterrific. And with such a great cast I expected that I would love thisfilm. My darling and I both exited feeling soooo disappointed. It isquite funny in parts (sometimes unintentionally which is unfortunate),but overall one of those films where I want my 2 hours back.
