The release of Kingsman: The Secret Service in 2014 surprised us all.Based on a relatively obscure comic book series, Matthew Vaughan'sultra-violent and wickedly depraved action comedy was a breath of freshair for cinema-goers with its inventively over the top action, largerthan life characters and unique approach to its genre sparking glowingaudience reactions and a box-office haul north of $400 million dollars.With audiences clambering for more Kingsman action, Vaughan and histeam return for the Golden Circle, a sequel that doesn't sully the nameof the original but one that also feels rather bloated in parts andloses the element of surprise that made the first Kingsman such anunexpectedly wild ride.Clocking in at roughly 140 minutes, Golden Circle sees Taron Egerton'sEggsy and Mark Strong's Merlin make a trip to the USA in search oftheir sister-agency The Statesman, after their British safe houses aredestroyed by Julianne Moore's lunatic drug baron Poppy.Recruiting newcomers Pedro Pascal, Channing Tatum, Halle Berry and theTexan-drawl slinging Jeff Bridges along with the returning Colin Firth,The Golden Circle freshens things up in a cast sense but keeps theformula very much the same, as the two agencies look to uncover thetruth behind Poppy's nefarious plans to hold the world hostage via adeadly drug strand.The most glaringly obvious thing about Golden Circle and the return tothis crazy world is the fact it's nowhere near as funny The SecretService.It's not to say there aren't laughs in Golden Circle (and aparticularly long winded pop star cameo); they can often be found incircumstances and situations that shouldn't be humorous which is astaple of Vaughan's works, but it doesn't balance the act of action andcomedy as well as Vaughan's first Kingsman ride.At well over the two hour mark, those expecting a bullet-a-minuteaction extravaganza as well will be a little disappointed. Things startout with a bang with a thrilling car chase and there are sporadicallyscattered action scenes throughout but those expecting a finale as eyepopping as the first film or even a scene that matches it with famouschurch fight from the original will be left disappointed.It's possible we were just spoilt by Vaughan's first foray into theKingsman universe as the ability for the film to remove itself fromreality yet remain grounded around robot dogs and dancing drug addledvictims with glaring blue veins is quiet the feat, while Vaughan'shandiwork when the action kicks up is second-to-none, and even thoughthe film could've chopped a further 30 minutes in the editing suite,it's hard not to enjoy a frenetic finale in a bizarre 50's Americanasetting while seeing renowned actors like Julianne Moore having suchfun with their roles makes sure Golden Circle is always a cut-aboveeven when its flirting the line of losing itself within itsself-created whirlpool of colour and insanity.Final Say ? Ticking all the Kingsman boxes that fans of the original will beseeking to check off, The Golden Circle may not provide on the samelevel of the first film but anyone that loved Eggsy's debut in the highbody count adventure will enjoy this new trip, while those that weren'tfans should stay very far away from this freshly minted exercise in thehyper-real and super energized spy caper.3 freshly cooked burgers out of 5
