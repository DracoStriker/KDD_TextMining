While I enjoyed the original film. Kingsman: the Golden Circle lacksthe stakes and brilliant of the original. The film did everything thatthe original does right wrong. The movie itself become cliché withevery plot points you see it coming beforehand unlike the previous filmwhere they actually make fun of the genre clichés and conventions. Thecharacters did not learn anything in the film. Everyone stays the same.Almost every new characters in the film appear for about 5 minuteseach. Yet the film is overlong and nothing important really happens.There was a good chunk of the film spending on Colin Firth characterwhich was unnecessary. Julianne Moore plays a cartoonish villains witha convoluted stupid plan that unlike the original film where it wasactually tongue in cheek for the spy movies. But I have to give creditwhere credit's due, the action are still really entertaining to watchand there were a lot of great scenes throughout the whole movie butstill, it does not do enough to be a great film on its own.
