I preferred the first part which was original fun and self ironic. Thisone took itself a little bit too seriously at times. Also the storyitself was not as fun as in the first one, all in all they overdideverything. Taron Egerton was fun as in the first one and gave thefinest performance in the film. Colin Firth was all right but can dobetter, he was very much reduced. Julianne Moore was not great. I wasreally looking forward to see her playing a villain but the result wasdisappointing. Overacting and really not great at all. Thats not hermaterial. I mean she was not awful or anything but based on her usualstandards really not brilliant. Its sad to see that an Oscar winningactress like Halle Berry needs to reduce herself to second hand rolesthat easily could have been a breakout role for a newcomer orsomething. I still don't get why Channing Tatum was there as he wastotally useless. Jeff Bridges was wasted in a very one dimensionalrole. But he obviously had fun playing it. Nice to see small fine turnsby Bruce Greenwood and Emily Watson. Don't get me started on EltonJohn. Nice gimmick but they really, really stretched it. Good to seeMark Strong again who was decent. The action scenes were great though,especially the opening one, maybe a bit over styled and of courseunrealistic but they were intend to be that. Good soundtrack as well.But one of the biggest problems was that it was absolutely overlong andthey could have cut half of it and it still would be the same (maybebetter) product.
