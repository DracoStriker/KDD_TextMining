After loving the first installment, this was just so, so disappointing.The first film was flash but not too flash- walking that tightrope offabulous to solid plot but remaining coherent with characters we couldreally dig.Not this film. This film falls off the tight rope and right into thesun.Don't get me started on all of the character development that doesn'thappen, blatant inconsistencies and just plain WTF? of this lazy, lazyscript.I wont do more than mention the overdose of swaggering Americana- and Ido mean Over Dose. (All of the US agents come off as hackneyed fools-except Halle Berry, and the whole movie you're thinking, "when willHalle get to DO something? Why the heck is she even IN this movie?")I wont do more than say that Colin Frith just looked extremely annoyedthe whole movie, like he'd rather be anywhere else - and you can tellwhy. None of the actors were used to their potential. None. (For thatmatter neither was the story line.)The action sequences were not even that great, more cobbled togetherand repetitive, and the one or two good scenes couldn't make me stopjust WISHING IT WOULD JUST END. I left the theatre depressed over what could have been and totally wasnot.
