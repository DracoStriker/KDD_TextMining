A boring movie that had me yawning all the way through. The maincharacter keeps popping in and out of accents. Harry makes a weirdcomeback around an hour into the movie. A soulless, unfunny movie thatcould have been a lot better after the first hit.Save your money and see something else unless you're on Limitless.
