it's really disheartening that "faggot" is still allowed. granted it'sused by a "backward hillbilly in Kentucky" trying to prove hismanliness. but, still. other than that obvious insult, the rest of themovie is just as insulting. it starts off with a james bond flourishand already i'm bored. ms moore must be here for the big paycheck, aswell as mr firth. you can't blame them, of course. we all have to paythe bills. the set pieces are so mechanical they are also boring. allthe acting stinks. your move.
