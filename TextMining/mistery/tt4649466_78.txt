Action, visuals, and? oh wait, that's it?So "Kingsman: The Golden Circle," directed by Matthew Vaughn, is thesequel to the action-packed and quite charming, "Kingsman: The SecretService." It continues right where it left off with Eggsy, played byTaron Egerton, as an agent for Kingsman. Here, something big happensand he teams up with Merlin, played by Mark Strong, to "save theworld."The movie is a visual thrill ride, with the most absurd actionsequences you will ever see. Guns popping out of umbrellas andbriefcases, advanced watches that can do anything imaginable, and muchmore. The cinematography was absolutely wonderful.Unfortunately, this is where the praising of the movie ends. The movieis quite choppy with its transition through action sequences. The plotis as convoluted as Suicide Squad's, with all its unnecessary subplots.During the second act, it was really hard to tell what the heck wasgoing on in the movie. When I was able to comprehend all themumbo-jumbo that was being showcased, yet another curve ball was thrownto make things more confusing.One of the characters who seems like a significant player does not needto be in the movie. The way the movie justifies that characterspresence towards the end is very predictable and unneeded. Without thecharacter, the movie would have been around 10 minutes shorter and itwould not have made a difference in the end goal.Now, you may be thinking that "Kingsman: The Golden Circle" must havebeen an unbearable movie, but in truth, it is not. The action sequencesand visuals make up for the plot mishaps. It is a fun and crazy movieto watch. Rarely, are action movies this ridiculous, and still, providequite the amusement. Not everyone will enjoy this sequel, with itsridiculous plot, but "Kingsman: The Golden Circle" is what it is: A fundisappointment.Rating: 1.75/3
