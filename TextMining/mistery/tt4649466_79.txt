I loved the first Kingsman movie. It was full of action, fun, jokes andthe actors did a great job. I came into this movie theater hoping todelight myself with a sequel that would at least match the firstinstallment. As soon as the first scene came on the screen, I knew Ihad been fooled and it would end up being some of the most dreadful 2hours in my movies watching history! I was right. This movie might havesome actions but every moment is "telephoned" long in advance. Thestory is absolutely stupid. I wish it would be possible to request afull refund when a movie is that bad and that each refund is countedtowards its overall success/failure. It is not fair that people aregetting paid with my money receiving millions of dollars for such apoor performance. The day this option becomes possible we might finallysee some serious work being done in the movie industry!
