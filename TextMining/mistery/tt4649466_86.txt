Even though I have never reviewed the original Kingsman film, I wouldprobably give it an 8. For me, it came from nowhere and hit hard withstyle, beautifully filmed action and consistently strong comedy.Understandably, this sequel (which I'll say now was fantastic for asequel), tries to recapture what made the first film so special.This leads to my biggest problem with the film; It relies heavily onreferences to the first film to strengthen it. Much like A New Hope andThe Force Awakens, the plot feels painfully similar. The creatorsadvertised this in the trailers, calling back to what the first filmdescribed as being the best type of 'spy movie', with a colourfulmegalomaniac, exotic gadgets and that sort of thing. However, this isliterally the framework used in the original.As the film reaches it's final sequence, there are more and moresimilarities, down to the last fight scene using a piece of music whichbuilds similarly with the action as Free Bird did so effectively in thechurch from the original... But it doesn't feel like it works as well.Having said that, the film is a massive amount of fun. The comedy isn'tas consistent as in the first and the use of CGI feels a bit morenoticeable, especially in the impressive opening sequence, but it's agreat film. The story is interesting, the 50s style of the mainvillain's base is attractive and the acting is as good here as it wasin the previous entry. Elton John's part in this film is surprisinglyprominent and so ridiculous that it becomes hilarious.To fully enjoy this, you'd need to be willing to suspend disbelief andget carried away. Also, ideally, to avoid seeing the parallels betweenthis and the original, you would need to try and forget about it, butthere's so much crossover that it's a difficult thing to do.Overall, while not as funny or as original as the first film, TheGolden Circle is a strong sequel and is definitely worth a watch.
