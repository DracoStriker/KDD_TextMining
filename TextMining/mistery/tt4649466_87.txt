Looking for a great wait to kill 2 hours, this movie will do it. Asequel to the original Kingsmen: The Secret Service which was releasedback in 2014 the film stays with it's original protagonists whilstintroducing many new characters also. The star-studded line up of TaronEgerton, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Julianne Moore, Halle Berry,Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges not to mention the one and only EltonJohn.It was a great idea to introduce the British Kingsmen to the AmericanStatesmen, while the contrast is clear, through out the movie theyprove to work well together as a team.This movie's just filled with great action sequences in terms offights, an action packed car chase and a cable car ride from hell.While the story might of been off on the absurd and unrealistic sideand felt a tad draggy in places, it didn't steer me away from the funthis film has to offer 8.1/10
