Lady Bird was very well-received at its local premiere at the ParamountTheater for the Austin Film Festival. I found it to be a sweet,charming coming-of-age film. It is a serious film, but with flashes ofhumor. Greta Gerwing wrote and directed the film which seemed to bepartly autobiographical in that she grew up in Sacramento, CA at aboutthe same time as her character. The film is a meditation on what itmeans to be from some place and what that idea of home means in shapingwho you become. She has a love-hate relationship with her city, herfamily and her place in both. It is also very much a story of younggirl struggling with her own and her mother's expectations for herself.The script is really charming with the best scenes being those of LadyBird and her mother. Lady Bird is struggling with sexuality, family,friendship, religion and even her own name all at the same time. Likeall of us, she is trying to find her place in the world. Saoirse Ronanis excellent as Lady Bird as is Laurie Metcalf in the role of herhaggard struggling mother trying to hold her family together throughdifficult times. Recommended to those who like drama, particularlycoming-of-age films.
