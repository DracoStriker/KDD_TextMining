Portraying a likable rebel is a hard thing to do on screen. You wouldhave to set up why they are the way they are, and still be able to givethem fleeting moments of empathy or just go all the way with noregrets. Lady Bird takes a stab at finding the balance from first timedirector Greta Gerwig in a relatively conservative scenery but does alot to make her stand out in this hilarious coming of age story.Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) is Catherine McPherson's given alias when shebecomes bored living her familiar life while in a Catholic High Schoolin Sacramento. Her new persona makes her become more wandering andnaturally gravitating to many different things around her like boys,new female friends and the dream of finding more like herself in a eastcoast college away from home.Saoirse Ronan does a great job as a rebellious yet empathetic teenageras her angst does feel like it comes from a genuine place. What I'vealways had issues in the past from coming of age films is they make theteenagers problems feel self inflicted, but instead her character iscoming more from a place of needing to explore more in life. Thedirector also gives a lot of great snappy dialogue with all thecharacters and having some truly hilarious moments (there's a scenewhere the kids are slow dancing to Bone Thugs n Harmony's TheCrossroads that has me screaming).As for faults, there aren't too many, but are more so nitpicks withinthis films wings. While the film has a great first and third act, thesecond act has a couple of dragging moments. It's not often or supernoticeable, but some of the films strongest points are around the outershell.Lady Bird doesn't reinvent the wheel of coming of age stories, howeverit does move with a lot of charm. Saoirse is great in he lead role, areally strong script and has you on a ride with a character learningfrom their mistakes and understanding how their actions affect others.Rating: 9.3 / 10
