And definitely one of the best films of 2017, period. As a matter offact, the entire film is wonderfully acted, written and directed. (IfLaurie Metcalf doesn't at least get a supporting actress nominationthere is simply no justice in this world.) The characters arerefreshingly real, multi-dimensional, nuanced and fascinating, and thefemale characters, especially, are blessed with legit real dialogue andnot the usual bogus generic tropes. One of the cinematic delights of the year.
