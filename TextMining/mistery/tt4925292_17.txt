Saoirse Ronan stars as Christine "Lady Bird" McPherson, a teenager inSacramento, California in Greta Gerwig's solo writing/directing debut.She is not a terribly good student, nor does her family have any moneyto speak of, but she is committed to attending university in NYC. Thefilm follows her episodically through her last year of high school,showing her relations with friends, boys and her intensely critical mom(Laurie Metcalf). This is a low key, extremely engaging film that Ithoroughly enjoyed, but didn't really blow me away as I was watchingit. It snuck up on me though ... it has some really beautiful momentsthat surprise with how they deal with familiar material in novel ways.Playwright Tracy Letts ("Bug", "Killer Joe") is great in a low key roleas her father.
