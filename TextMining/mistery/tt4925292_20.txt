I love Greta Gerwig. I admit it. As far as I can see, her movie rolesare all a version of herself, which is utterly charming. So obviously Ihad to go see this.Yet ANOTHER coming of age film? Yes and no. Yes, the same subjectmatter. No, not the same approach. It's like saying Lord of the Ringswas a movie about talking trees. Greta, who both wrote and directed themovie, sustained the high level throughout. How often do you see this?Usually the first 10-15 minutes are funny, then they run out of ideas.But Greta kept the ideas coming, and the result was (to me anyway) acompletely new take on a high school girl coming of age.For one thing, I was laughing out loud every few minutes. I won't giveaway the best lines, but they were all fresh and unexpected. Let's justsay that the football coach as director of the school play wasinspired. But so was the mother. And the father. And the friends. Andthe boy friends. It was all just brilliant. Time and time again Gretawas faced with yet another trite situation that she made fresh andfunny. And the acting--except for the lead character, we had journeymanactors. But they all did a great job. Not too little, not over the top.Just right. And Saoirse not only made herself LOOK like Greta (samesmile....) she SOUNDED like Greta. A friend we saw the movie with wasconvinced Greta was playing herself in the movie. We had to convinceher it wasn't. Whether this was intentional or not I don't know, but ineither case Saorirse did an outstanding job.
