I have seen at least three of her films. In every case she isoutstanding. Unlike Brooklyn where she turned from a modest duck into astunning swan, Ronan stays awkward while giving a seamless performance.As a parent with adult children, there isn't anything about this moviethat seems ridiculous or contrived. All of the performances are topshelf. While mostly set in a Catholic HS, the RC faith, the religiousorders, and the attitudes of the laity are never ridiculed norcaricatured. There is some salty language and a few strongly suggestive scenes. ButI wouldn't hesitate to take a mature teen to see it.
