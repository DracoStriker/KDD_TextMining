I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolanmovies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that muchmoney to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a shipgetting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side thenremaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seeminglydefies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down aplane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beachwith lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers.Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes. The hype of thisbeing one of the best war movies ever had me expecting somethingspecial. Instead it had me sitting there wondering when the fantasticmovie was going to start. I waited in vain. Instead I left the showwith a headache from the noise bombardment from the soundtrack.Mybiggest sense of wonder was that they had spent that much money makingit. I wanted to like this movie but it never happened for me.
