Being an avid war film fan, I was beyond excited seeing the trailer forDunkirk and couldn't wait until it hit theatres. To say I wasdisappointed is an understatement. By the end of the film, I wasactually mad. I have to agree with some of the reviewers here who've stated that manyof these glowing reviews are paid for, because what they're describingisn't even the same film.Before the artsy-fartsy daggers come out--no, I don't need tons ofbackstory to feel invested in the characters. It's war, it's brutal,and I can surmise what it must be like for these brave souls. But whenI come out the film and can't remember a single character's name (orworse, even care about them), that's just crap storytelling. Art shouldinspire a connection. This left me devoid of anything to be honest.Scale...I may as well have been watching a tiny pocket of somesoldiers, fighting some war, taking place somewhere. Part of what's soastonishing and inspiring about Dunkirk was its sheer scale. Thisinsipid attempt to condense it to bite-sized POVs is insulting. Youwould expect at the end when the character (I literally can't rememberhis name) began reading Churchill's announcement to be roused byemotion. But since the film didn't generate any, and the delivery wasso bland, it didn't even click with me what he was reading until Iheard, "We shall fight on the beaches." Lastly, a film doesn't have to be linear so I don't mind differing timelines. This however, was like some art-house, "look at how cool I playwith time" film school project. I'm sorry...GAWD I'm sorry... but thiswas bad. I think about 100+ reviews explained why it doesn't work.Storytelling has been used by our species for centuries to share POVs,be morality tales, entertain screaming kids who won't sleep...you getthe picture. NONE of that happens if your audience doesn't connect withthe story. This was an experiment and indulgence. A $150M indulgenceand waste of viewers' time and money. Shame on you.
