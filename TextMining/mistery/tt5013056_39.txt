...that movie was better than this. I've seen plenty of horror movies... but not one has terrified me morethan seeing this prime example of what Hollywood has come to now. Thetwo hours of this film were just a disgrace of what a rich studio cando for a quick paycheque. If Christopher Nolan wanted the audience to feel as shell-shocked andhorrified as the characters in his movie, then he truly succeeded. Ihave never wanted to escape the situation of being in that theatre morethan his characters wanted to escape that beach. First of all, this isn't your typical war movie. There was nobloodshed, no gore, not even any real violence, which some might findrefreshing. However, there was also hardly any dialogue and zerocharacter/plot development...you know, things you would expect in abasic movie. I wanted to care for the characters so badly, or anything that went onin this movie. But the scenes were either too dragged out, or theywould cut out at odd times, leaving you with a general disconnect fromwhat was going on in any scene. The only explanation for what went onwas just in the form of incomprehensible murmurs from the actors. Thismovie was based on a heroic and honourable rescue mission, and if theaudience was made known of this simple fact, it would have set such abetter tone. This movie had so much potential. If Nolan focused more onplot development rather than aesthetics, this movie might've actuallybeen worthy of the multiple Oscar nominations it is going to get. To sum it up, this movie is basically a beautiful war-themed musicvideo on mute. If you can appreciate that as a movie, then maybe youwill enjoy Dunkirk. As for me, I'd rather watch worms hatch eggs thancome anywhere close to a movie like this ever again.
