As a WWII buff (listening to "The Longest Day: Music From The ClassicWar Films" as I type), I had expected to be first in line when thisfilm came out but I hesitated after reading initial reviews. Whileextremely positive, many reviews commented on aspects of the film, fromthe non-linear narrative structure to the choice of characters focusedon, that left me feeling that I would not enjoy the movie. I finallybroke down and saw it because of its continued box office performancebut found it as lackluster as I'd feared.Present-day WWII movies just don't hold a candle to the classics (AllQuiet on the Western Front, The Longest Day, Bridge on the River Kwai,Patton, and my all-time favorite film, The Great Escape), nor evenbig-budget mediocre fare from relatively recent times like A Bridge TooFar or The Battle of Britain. There's way too much pretentious nonsensein modern war movies. Every filmmaker these days has to make a"statement" about the horrors of war, as if intelligent viewers weren'talready aware of that fact. Therefore, instead of a good story withappealing and memorable characters we get one that focuses on "thecoward," because in the modern-day mindset, anyone who acts in war withdignity and courage and self-sacrifice is seen as unrealistic andsomehow a dupe of the evil powers that be. None of those characters was remotely interesting or appealing and thetime shifts were totally unnecessary. In addition, the omnipresentmusic was a total turn-off. There was never any chance to actually hearthe real sounds of war, which includes silence and the banter ofsoldiers trying to make the best of a bad situation. All told, this isthe most-overrated movie I've seen in years. Thank God I have theclassics on VHS and DVD.
