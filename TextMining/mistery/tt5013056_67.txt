If you are interested in or have knowledge of World War II history,don't go to see this movie. If you have family in the armed forces,and/ or like 'saving private Ryan', similarly avoid this movie. It willannoy you, infuriate you, bore you. It does not inform or shape yourunderstanding of what happened at Dunkirk. It is gratuitous labelling.The story is about something else, something I can't be botheredconsidering, something 'arty', something glorifying cowardice whenthere are soldiers of caliber all around. I went to see a movie aboutthe astonishing evacuation at Dunkirk. I got something else that wascheap and nasty and insulting.
