The subject matter provided so much potential, so much opportunity -but instead it is unbelievably bad in almost every possible respect. Itmay have been closer to a Battle of Britain film than about Dunkirk.For a film about Dunkirk I would watch the old one from the 1950'swhich is a little slow at the beginning as they develop the characters- but in the end the film so so much better having characters in it.I guess the budget must have run out though - they didn't have enoughmoney to buy any German uniforms. You don't see any German troopsfighting. Even when they are in the boat all you see is bullet holesappearing but you don't see the Germans. Then at the very end of thefilm you see the pilot being taken prisoner by two Germans who areblurred out! Why was that?
