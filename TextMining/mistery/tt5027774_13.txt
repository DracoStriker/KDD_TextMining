Amidst the oppressive noise level of heavily formed but largely emptyand meaningless clunkers like the two behemoths currently bloating outthe screens at multiplexes, "Thor: Ragnarok" and "Justice League" , ifyou look carefully, you can still find some cinematic gems here andthere. Such as "Three Bilboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"A movie born out of the pain and sorrow brought on by incomprehensibleand tragic loss, seething anger at the injustice in this world and theinjuries inflicted by life, wounds that never really heal, because theyare not physical but exist only in the soul.The scar-tissue which forms from that can birth something bothwonderful and simultaneously terrifying. The cast is exquisite, the story powerful and poignant and the movie asa whole is an affirmation of what it is to be human and live through itday after day. The balance of tragedy and humour is brilliant, because they both makesense as fellow travellers. If misery loves company, then this moviealso proves that it loves comedy. Characters you think you have pegged as an overwrought and exaggeratedstereotype turn out to be anything but. Easily one of the best movies of the year.Do yourselves a favour and forgo the fast- food, zero caloriesspectacles and give this movie a chance. You may be reminded thatmovies can have substance and stand for something, especially duringthese dark days we are traversing.
