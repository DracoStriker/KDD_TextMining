THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI (2017) **** FrancisMcDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, AbbieCornish, Lucas Hedge, Zeljko Ivanek, Amanda Warren, Sandy Martin, PeterDinklage, John Hawkes, Samara Weaving, Clarke Peters. Pitch blackcomedy/drama with McDormand (in an Oscar calibre turn) as anunapologetically strident, small-town woman seeking justice by buyingadvertising space to shame the local constable (Harrleson in a solid,low-key turn) for not solving the rape/murder of her daughter, fanningthe fires for anger in the community and familial discord. Rockwell(also award worthy) is a hoot as a bigoted, imbecile cop on the forcewho is more than he appears and that could equally apply to theriotously profane and surprisingly poignant film by writer/directorMartin McDonagh who shows in more ways than one that still waters rundeep. One of the year's very best and highly original films.
