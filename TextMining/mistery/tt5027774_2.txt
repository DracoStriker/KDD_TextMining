I tried to write the summary of this movie for three days and still ihave not found the correct words to connect them in order to make asentence capable of expressing the quality of it. I have written thesummary many times and i have erased in every occasion. So i decided toshow some dots in the summary. That is the symbol of how excellent themovie is.The plot :The plot is very much uncommon. it has so many facts that it offers youa guessing 2 hour while you goes through the movie. It provides enoughbackbone to the rest of the element of the movie. It creates a concretebase upon which the movie stands firmly.The mystery :As the movie deals with a murder it contains enough mystery to shakethe audiences. Scene after scene all this unpacked. But they have towait till the end to solve the puzzles.The resistance : The movie is about the resistance of a mother. It starts with thedesperate mission of a mother to bring the killers of her daughter tolight. Those billboards, the sudden attacks, burgaining against thelocal authority.. all these are the part of a resistant mother which isalso the part and parcel of the movie.Acting :Acting in my view is up to the mark. Frances Mcdormand is exquisite inher role as a mother seeking justice. Others have also come to theparty.Direction :This is the characterstics of the movie i was most impressed with.Although the plot and the acting is out of question but it is thedirector who has the sole credit to connect all this. He has slowly butcleverly unfolded all the sector available. He is good enough to makethe movie what it looks like in the projector. He has turned the rawmaterials to a mature masterpiece.Questions and answers :last of all the main event is the answers of the question that werearoused during the first session of the movie. You have to wait to findthe answers. This waiting makes it more attractive.So clearly it is a movie of great quality..a bit older type..but youknow old is gold..
