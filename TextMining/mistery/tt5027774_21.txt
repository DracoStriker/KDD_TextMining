"Three Billboards" is a funny, thrilling and heartfelt journey aboutlife, understanding and forgiveness. Actually, very few movies can befunny, thrilling and heartfelt at the same time, and this is surely agreat achievement by this movie. The screenplay, acting, directing, music score, soundtrack,cinematography, makeup and production design are undoubtedly perfectand top-notch. Frances McDormand has long established herself as one ofthe best actresses of all time, and in this movie, she exhibitsincredible abilities in line deliveries, facial expressions and bodymovements. Sam Rockwell also shines throughout the movie by perfectlyplaying a retarded yet heartwarming cop, and shows a clear transition.The music score is sensational, especially when the three billboardsgets burned. The cinematography sometimes mimics one's gaze and isamazing. The screenplay is genius in the sense that you never know whatis going to happen next. There are several moments that are simply unforgettable and touching.For example, Red forgives about Dixon, who beats him up, and offers hima cup of orange juice. Also, Dixon forgives Mildred, who burns him, andsays "who else could it be". Mildred forgives his ex- husband, whoburns her billboards, and does not throw the bottles on him. Jamescovers up Mildred's crime and makes a dating story. The worker offersto rebuild Mildred's billboards after they are burned. An interestingthing in the movie is the two letters of Willoughby, one to Dixon andone to Mildred. In fact, the letter to Dixon changes his personality,and it really shocks me that when he gets burned, he still thinks ofprotecting the case files of Angela Hayes. All in all, this is definitely the best film of 2017, and possibly thebest of the last decade.
