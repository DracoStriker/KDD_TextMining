I watched this movie during the 2017 Toronto International FilmFestival (TIFF) after it had won the Grolsch People's Choice Award. Ialready had high hopes for this movie and it definitely did notdisappoint! Concept of the movie seems pretty easy to understand:Mildred Hayes (played by Frances McDormand) is still grieving the lossof her murdered daughter and challenges the local sheriff's (WoodyHarrelson) inability to find her killer. From watching the trailer Iwas a little unsure if this was going to be a drama or a comedy, butturns out it was both, or more accurately a dark comedy. The first fewminutes of the movie really set the tone for keeping you interested inthe dramatic core, maintaining the humour in events as they unfold. Notonly are the characters perfectly cast individually (example my fav SamRockwell as Officer Jason Dixon), but the writing of the entire scriptmakes it so easy to enjoy this entire movie. Writer/Director Martin McDonagh deserves a high five for thisaccomplishment!
