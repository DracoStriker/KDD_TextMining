I decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of thehype (which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that istold from the perspective of a black man).Well, I can see this would be truly the worst nightmare of a black man(and really the worst nightmare for us all). This is NOT a film thattries to make the viewer feel "sorry" for black people, nor is it atall preachy, but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with afresh new setting. I'm an old white guy by the way.The acting is wonderful, and directing is amazing. The film, whilemostly horror, is actually completely hilarious in some parts, makingit the funniest AND scariest movie I have seen in ages (no easy feat).It is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the companyof Academy Award potential nominees, because the directing and actingis honestly Oscar worthy. Again, no small feat for a horror movie thatis also funny.In summary, this is a MUST SEE at the theater and one of the best filmsof the year. It is a fun ride that is very well done!
