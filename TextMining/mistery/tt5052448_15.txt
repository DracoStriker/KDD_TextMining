This movie is appropriately in a genre Mr. Jordan Peele has christened,"Social Thriller". The movie creates a very unsettling feeling from thebeginning that slowly builds to a crescendo, that forces the viewer tosee prejudices head on. When all is said and done, you now have kind ofa bird's eye view of what is wrong with society. But besides that, ithints a Hitchcock-type of thrill that is sure to deliver Goosebumps. AHUGE congratulations to Jordan Peele for hitting a HOME RUN, his firsttime up to bat. Looking forward to future projects from him. GO SEE,GET OUT. ??
