Fantastic! I would not call it "horror" but certainly "thriller" withsome comedy thrown into it. This Jordan Peele fellow has managed tobring something new to this genre and I certainly hope he'll do morethrillers.The cast is great and I especially enjoyed Betty Gabriels performance.Lots of faces I have never seen before and they all did a stellar job.And those faces I have seen before did a stellar job, too. =) I do not know if the overall idea is new but the way it was presentedand the way it was done feels very fresh.Warmly recommended!
