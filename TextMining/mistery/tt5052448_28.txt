The big surprise break-out hit of 2017, "Get Out" has received a lot ofcritical acclaim and still should be considered to be an underratedmovie; that's how good it is. The movie does not necessarily use themost original concept (we have seen similar things with "Rosemary'sBaby" or "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" before), but the movie mainlybenefits from its clever storytelling - because sometimes it's notabout which story you are trying to tell, sometimes it's about how youare trying to tell it.The brilliant actors (Allison Williams was surprisingly good, CatherineKeener and Bradley Whitford were as good as was to be expected, andboy, was Daniel Kaluuya amazing) added to the film's success, as wellas its better-than-brilliant directing. Jordan Peele easily deserves anAcademy Award nomination for his work as an director; and it's easy tosee how much effort and lifeblood flew into the making of this movie."Get Out" is a horror movie, but not necessarily a horror movie in theoriginal sense of the word; you won't find much blood, just as youwon't find many jump scares - in this movie, it's all about thetension, meaningful dialogues, more tension, tension, tension. And it'sincredibly well done. Not a single scene has been wasted, every littleaspect of the movie has a purpose, and ultimately, that's what moviesshould be about: telling a story with so much love for its details thata viewer can simply sink into the movie and forget what's happeningaround him. Jordan Peele has already mastered this art in his directingdebut.
