This movie seems to have gone viral and has gotten an inordinate amountof views and praises, and there is indeed a lot to like, especially inits atmosphere, some little horror details, and how it was filmed inold-school style, but in the end it is just another sloppily writtenbrainless modern movie with huge plot holes.It is also unoriginal and predictable. It is basically a black versionof The Stepford Wives with an added twist.A black guy and his white girlfriend go to meet her family, andgradually uncover very strange goings on, especially with the verybizarre and creepy behaviour by the black people working for thefamily.*spoilers* First there is the idiotic and obviously ego-driven concept that allwhite people in this movie worship the black physique enough to want ablack body for themselves. I'm sure I don't have to point out how thisis untrue and awkwardly egotistical on the part of the film-maker, notto mention the well known statistic that black people have a muchhigher number of health problems. On top of that, this movie drives thepoint once again of how badly black people are treated in society, sowhy on earth would a white person want to become one according to itsown logic? Then there's the head-scratching plot point where they transplantedtheir grandma and grandpa into black people's bodies, except theyturned them into brainwashed slaves. Obviously someone switched plotsmidway through the movie and didn't think things through...These aren't just plot holes, they kill the whole backbone of themovie.Not to mention the happy ending that is in denial. The very next day,obviously he would be arrested for mass murder.P.S. Those of you blindly repeating the complaint about the cotton andhow he managed to get it in his ears... This is actually NOT a plothole. His hands were tied, but his head and upper body clearly weren'tand he even visibly bent down towards the cotton at the end of thescene.
