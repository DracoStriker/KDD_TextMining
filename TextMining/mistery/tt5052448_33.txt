I am a big fan of the Key & Peel show; i think they make funny comedywith some genuine brilliance in their approach to social themes,racism, and modern society.Get Out would work really well as a 5 minute, 10 tops, TV sketch.The premise is of a black guy who is taken by his girlfriend to see herall-white, suburban parents. Because we live in a modern world, BlackDude is less worried about racism and more about making a goodimpression with the dad & mum of the girl he is currently plowing.Once there, there are various very vague attempts at setting a mood oftension. Various unsettling characters are brought in. The main portionof the plot is made ridiculously obvious by this point, and also thissection of the film drags on waaaay too much.Then the guy is finally abducted, because "reverse racism, blacks areactually preferred to whites" and brain transplants. The whole thingcarefully exposed because some guy at the back row in the audiencedidn't already figure it all out.Once the transplant begins, the ending is pure low-grade action flick,and Guy (tm) finally gets to go home, sans-girlfriend. I'm sorry, but my opinion of Get Out is not very good. It's fairly wellshot, the supporting cast is .. not terrible, but the story is reallyweak, there is no tension whatsoever (i wouldn't even class this filmas a horror), the resolution of the plot if feeble .. do not bother with Get Out. It's a weak film that lacks in both styleand substance. My final vote: 5.5/10 - very little to watch.
