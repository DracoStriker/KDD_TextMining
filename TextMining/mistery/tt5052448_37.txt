People will be talking about this one for a long time.Get Out is an extremely powerful, poignant horror movie with somehumor. Whatever elements of action or schlock that are present take abackseat to the real human drama that plays out when Chris (DanielKaluuya) meets his white girlfriend's eccentric family.The characters are fleshed out immaculately, with Bradley Whitford andCatherine Keener in their best performances to date, and Caleb LandryJones in an appropriately, intensely creepy role. But Kaluuya is thestar here, and he delivers with zeal a shocking depth and range ofemotions. In fact, more often than not its what he doesn't say thatdelivers the most impact... which is all to say that this masterpiececould not have been accomplished without the masterful direction ofJordan Peele.Peele builds atmosphere and tension like the Big Bang, dunking you intothe mind of the main character while he navigates through very visceraldanger.If you're looking for a film that sets out to entertain first andforemost with shock and terror, but also with poignant socialcommentary and real philosophical meat to chew on, Get Out is the movieyou need to see. You won't regret it.This isn't Cabin in the Woods, Peele isn't interested in subvertinggenre conventions. What he has crafted is entirely original and unique,and thankfully free of clichés or stereotypes. There are no "monsters" here. The real villains are entitlement,egotism, and objectification, and g.d. they are scary!
