I don't know who is declaring a type of a movie these days but whoeverit is he doesn't know how to describe a horror 'cus this movie ain'tone. It is a psychological and a bit scary thriller.A whole idea of hypnosis is just too crappy. I think that anypsychiatrist would spit on this movie. Unrealistic and way too easyroad to a total open gate of a human mind.One of the main reason for my relatively low note is because a wholeplot, from beginning till end is more the predictive. If you pay just apinch of attention you will be able to know what is going to happen atany time.Other then hypno-crap, twisted psychology of this movie is quiteinteresting and beside few small mistakes it is proper movie. It gotthe action, blood, gore, psychos, bit of humor, small lack of eroticsfor a horror (or thriller as well).To sum, noting really special but quite watchable.
