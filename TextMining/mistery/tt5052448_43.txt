This movie in a word... TERRIBLE.If you want to see a comedy, go see a comedy. If you want to see ahorror, go see a horror. This movie claiming to be both of those thingsis an insult to both genres. There is NO comedy or horror to be seenhere.There's got to be a way to explain the 'hype' and positive reviewsabout this boring movie. I think it's mostly because critics wouldn'tdare hate on as it would label them racist.You have the feeling this is about the director, up on his soapbox,expressing his racism towards whites. But, hey, its seems it's OK forthem to do that. They get applauded for it.To sum up - Boring, Dull, Slow, Very Predictable (I saw the plotunfolding a mile away) Not funny or scary. Total waste of a Saturdaynight.
