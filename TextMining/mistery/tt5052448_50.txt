This movie was OK, but I don't get why lots of people think it's one ofthe best horror films from the past few years. Plus I agree with thosewho say it has racism in it. It's like the film is saying white peopleare bad and just want to take advantage of other races.Anyways the film revolves around Chris, whom is invited by hisgirlfriend, Rose, to her parents house for the weekend and a party. Atthe house, Chris meets a couple of other black people whom seem to beoff. At the party he takes a picture of one of them, and he flips outand tells Chris to "Get Out".Chris finds out the guy was someone from the neighborhood from hisbuddy Rod and that guy is missing. Chris realizes he needs to leaveafter finding a box of pictures of Rose with other black guys after shetold him he was the first black guy she's dated.So the final is Chris escaping. That part was good.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK but not the best horror film. I think peoplejust praised it because it actually had a little uniqueness about itand not the same old thing.
