I tried not to find out too much about this film before seeing it, butcouldn't help seeing the high scores. It is a great film, to a point...and that point is the final reel, at which point everything starts tofall apart.The "big reveal" comes 3/4 of the way through the film, and is just thewrong side of plausible to take seriously. We then go through a veryrapid succession of brutal kills; we get the clichéd "seeminglyunconscious person comes back for a jump scare, surprisinglyunscathed"... twice!And it's all rounded off with a final deus ex machina that really doesarrive from nowhere, in transport that really does beg someexplanation... but we never get one.It's a real shame, because everything that precedes is fantastic...it's a creepy, tense film that plays wonderfully on the racism in theon screen characters as much as the racism in the audience (no matterhow liberal you might think you are).Top Tip to writers... endings are so important. Get that nailed andeverything that leads up to it will write itself. Mess it up, andpeople will come away with a bad impression; particularly on subsequentviewings.
