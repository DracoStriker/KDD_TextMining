I feel like this movie should be classified as a mystery/comedy, ratherthan horror. That's how I'm rating this film. If I were to rate thisbased on how scary it is, it would be much lower.The premise and social commentary are quite interesting, and hilariousat times. The movie is just interesting enough to keep me engaged inthe film. Although nothing stood out at as particularly great. For sucha highly acclaimed film though, some of the films special effects lookhilariously amateurish, like something a college film student would puttogether. It doesn't really hurt the film all that much. It's justfunny to see from a Hollywood film. Maybe some of those amateur effectsare intentional.
