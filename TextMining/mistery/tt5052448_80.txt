Best thing about this film is the dog. I was really looking forward towatching it, but it's just awful, less horror, more comedy, ridiculousplot - I use that word loosely - and not at all engaging. Story couldhave been done in an hour, I have seen better in the Hammer House ofHorror series from the 70s! Absolute rubbish glad I didn't pay to seeit!
