This film was sadly lacking in every way: the story was thin and reliedon cheesy 'explanation' set ups to try and condense some sense from theslightly drunk narrative. The dialogue was spare and dull; I didn'thear a single laugh in the half full cinema I saw this turkey. Also,the acting was in keeping with the story & script: awful. DanielKaluuya has always appeared in good things (Psychoville, Black Mirror)but he can't save what ends up being a film as intense as 'Scary Movie'without any laughs.Get Out has been described as a genre-busting film but I found it to bea Sundance version of that. When I say Sundance, I mean a cheaply madefilm shot in the northern US states, usually in winter or fall, (autumnfor us Anglos)with a dialogue driven narrative and therefore nothing ofcinematographic interest nor musical.My idea of a genre-busting film would be Shaun Of The Dead: it uses thegenre of horror to drive the narrative but still has a very goodscript, distinctive characters and an equal blend of audio & visualhighlights.Get Out feels like a boring group of people made a film and then kiddedeveryone they were cool.
