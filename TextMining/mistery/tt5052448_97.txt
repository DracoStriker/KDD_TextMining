I went in expecting a knockout of a horror movie ...with a bit of humorin it according to the description and some word of mouth reviews. ...Ibarely made it through the entire movie. Really bad writing, directingand acting, although I like the two leads. It was nothing better than amid-range episode of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits; the comedy felljust as flat as the story for me ...it came off as completely forced;not funny at all.
