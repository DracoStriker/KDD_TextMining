I saw a pre-screening of Happy Death Day and let me tell you, it wasone of the most fun theater experiences I've had. The movie doesn'ttake itself too seriously, which is definitely for the best. If anyonewalks into a movie about a sorority girl living the same day over andover and being killed over and over and expects it to be somegenre-defying horror perfection, that's on them. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad movie by any means. JessicaRothe as Tree Gelbman and Israel Broussard as Carter Davis arefantastic as the two leads. They have excellent chemistry and make usroot for them. Rothe's character wasn't the typical horror moviesorority girl, either. She was cunning and badass. She made us believeshe could actually figure this mess out. If you don't change your mindon who the killer is at least twice throughout the film, you aren'tpaying attention.There are curveballs thrown left and right, which made my theater gaspand yell numerous times. You think the movie is about to end on atleast two different occasions. The script is smart, there's horror,there's comedy, there's drama. Happy Death Day takes you in numerousdirections, while also making sure you have fun along the way. This isdefinitely one of my all-time favorite campy horror flicks out there.It even pokes fun at Groundhog Day, which it very clearly took someinspiration from. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror; again,it doesn't redefine the genre and there are definitely an abundance ofclichés. With that, though, there are still a handful of clever momentsI certainly was not expecting.
