I think people going to see this movie are expecting wayyyy to muchfrom a slasher movie. I'm rating it based on what I expected, and I wascertainly impressed. This movie wasn't trying to be anything more thananother murder movie, but what made me want to see it was the idea oftaking Groundhog Day (which it fully admitted to ripping the idea from)and turning it into a slasher film. I was actually surprised it heldback on gore and blood. I was fully expecting it to be all the tropesof gross-out killings, but it was instead focused more on characterdevelopment and the story. I admit the characters are a bitone-dimensional, but again, it's a slasher movie. It's trying to winany academy awards here. In many ways I think it's parodying thoseone-dimensional characters of college trope characters and the "lastgirl" in horror movies because it goes all-in on establishing the maincharacters as somebody you're meant to hate at first. The endinggenuinely took me in a direction I didn't anticipate, and then it tookme back to what I was expecting, but did it in a way that I felt fresh.All in all, I had fun watching this movie, which I think what thismovie was meant to be: Fun.
