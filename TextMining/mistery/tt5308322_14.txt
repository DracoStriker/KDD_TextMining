Happy Death Day (2017) is technically a horror movie, but it's reallynot that scary. It's a fun movie that many people will enjoy, eventhose who hate horror movies. I feel like the advertising for thismovie lead many people, myself included, that it would just be one morevery forgettable horror movie that is uninspired and boring. But thatreally is not what Happy Death Day is. The movie has a plot likeGroundhog Day, but with a teenage murder mystery angle thrown in. Yes,the plot involving a person repeating the same day over and over hasbeen done many times and in many different forms, but I really didn'tthink the plot was tired or really unoriginal. It throws in a coupletwists and turns just when the audience thinks everything is allfigured out. Everything's not always completely as it seems. And thecast does a great job with their performances. The main stars reallyimpressed me. They handled their characters very well. The two mainstars had really lovely chemistry too, that made everything moreenjoyable. That's another word to describe the movie overall,enjoyable. This really is one to watch when you want something prettylight too. If you're looking for some good ol escapism, this is a goodpick. 8/10 for happy death day.
