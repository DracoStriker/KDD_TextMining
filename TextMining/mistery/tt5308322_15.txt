Happy Death Day is probably not going to become a cult classic of anysorts but if you like horror/comedy type of films you might like it. Itstarts of quite seriously and looks like it is taking the direction ofa typical on college campus slasher. After a while it takes a nice turnand becomes much lighter and that is when some of the comedy elementskick in. It also had a few twists which was a nice surprise. You arenot going to avoid any clichés by watching it since it has them all,good looking bitchy sorority girls, a handsome college professor withan English accent and a good-hearted shy kid.One thing I could not get out of my mind while watching it is howsimilar to Before I Fall it is. It is a drama/mystery also releasedthis year and the premise is almost the same although Before I Fallfeels more serious.Do not take Happy Death Day too seriously, relax and you should havefun watching it. I believe that was the main intention of everyoneinvolved in making it.
