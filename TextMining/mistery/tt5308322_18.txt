A movie with so many plot holes you can drive a truck through it.Atalented director could cover the holes up but alas that doesn'thappen. A script that makes very little sense even for a horror film.Sometimes it seems like they where thinking about making a spoof. Yetthe director could not make up his mind what he was going for.Theactors do try their best and that's why it gets 2 stars.
