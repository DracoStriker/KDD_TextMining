Happy Death Day comes from Blumhouse Productions, the studio madefamous for the resurgence of horror in theaters (Get Out, The Purge,Insidious). However, this is the lightest of light thrills. Sure, itwould fit in the slasher movie bin, but with its bubble gum aestheticsand goofy comedy, it's really more Freaky Friday than Friday the 13th.And in that sense, it's mildly charming?if not bright enough to begreat. For starters, the premise is pretty stupid, and the execution ofthat premise isn't much better. A brash and awful sorority girl isforced to relive the same birthday over and over, each one ending inher own murder by a masked killer. Imagine Groundhog Day or Edge ofTomorrow, but in the teen-screams genre and with a lot less complexity.In fact, most of its "originality" just comes in its blanket theft fromother properties and throwing them all together: the youth world ofMean Girls; the comedy of "Scream Queens"; the protagonist from "TheGood Place"; the scares from The Purge. It's not bad, just familiar,like we're reliving this recognizable movie just as the characterrelives her day. Once our girl starts trying to solve thewhodunit-mystery, things get more assured and fun, as we find it easierto root for her and her insistence on not dying each day ad infinitum.Even though the deaths and scares are wanting, the other elements work,especially the humor and (gasp!) the heart. It's harmless andforgettable October fare, made more for people who hate horror than me.In other words, my wife will love it.
