Take Phil, the self centered, obnoxious, rude weatherman fromGroundshog Day who is a major jerk and change his character into a girland you have Tree (Teresa):the self centered, obnoxious rude college co-ed sorority girl in HappyDeath Day, who is a major witch.Just like Phil, Tree will re-live her day over and over and each timeshe will have to make some changes in her behavior so the next day willbe slightly different from the previous day until she is able to breakthe deja vu cycle.The only difference between Phil's day and Tree's day is Tree isgetting murdered each time; so not only does she wants to break thecycle, she needs to find out who is the killer that is killing her overand over.There are a couple of surprises here and the premise is very workablebut the writers and director just couldn't bring it all together tomake it work as a solid horror film which at times it's almost mockingitself.The PG-13 rating also impedes this movie to become truly scary andsuspenseful because there is only so much you can do and get away withwithout it bordering on and/or earning an R-rating.
