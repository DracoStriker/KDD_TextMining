I didn't see the trailer before the movie and I haven't read any reviewof the movie. I just saw it on the cinema schedule and I decided togive it a try. For the first 30 minutes it kinda reminded me of Edge ofTomorrow(I haven't watched Groundhog Day). Then the movie started tolook like a horror movie from '90s, which is nice if you ask me,because I was aching for something like I know what you did lastsummer, Scream or Final Destination(first one before the series turnedinto a bloodfest). Also, the cast fits perfectly with the roles and thecharacters. The ending was also a thumbs up, given the feeling themovie gives you. Overall, this was not a waste of time. It's far frombeing an excellent movie, don't look at it as a classic or something.You could call it a smiling face in the crowd, I guess that sums uppretty well this movie.
