Imagine choosing a film at the multiplex just because you couldn't findanything else worth seeing that day at that particular theater,crossing your fingers you hadn't just wasted your money on a ticketsimply because some early reviews had said this was a surprisingly goodfilm, and then enjoying the heck out of the film you happened to takethat risk on-- that's what happened with "Happy Death Day," mostly dueto Jessica Rothe's performance. She will undoubtedly get plenty of workafter this star-making moment in her filmography. Her performancehappily reminds me there are tons of hungry actors out there--just givethem a chance to shine, in any genre, and they will. Here's why I endedup giving it ten out of ten stars: I love comedies, and have beenstruggling to find good ones to support in the multiplexes lately. Whenthis turned out to be one of the funniest films I'd seen in ages, onethat had me laughing out loud often, especially when I was expecting amostly horror- oriented film, I have to give it high praise. Comedy istough, and this film succeeds completely in balancing the horror andcomedy elements. Just one example: there is a roughly ten-minute scenenear the climax that had me laughing out loud continuously, and Icouldn't be more grateful. A warning about the trailer for the film Ihad seen prior to the film's opening--it was so awful, making the filmlook so much like a quick, unimaginative money-grab for the horrorgenre crowd, that I almost skipped the film based solely on thetrailer. Thankfully, I didn't, and what an exhilarating joy this turnedout to be! One of the best surprises of 2017.
