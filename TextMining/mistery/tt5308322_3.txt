This type of movie has been done many times before and rarely succeeds,but this one was a hit for me! Jessica Rothe's performance is what kept me interested... she nailedher character and was convincing and funny as well.I don't want to give too much away, but the twists towards the end werea nice surprise and earned a few extra points from me.It's classified as a Horror, Mystery, Thriller but it's also a comedyas I found myself laughing a bunch of times.Certainly a must-see entertaining film produced and executed very well,much better than many other films in this genre.It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.
