With Halloween coming up, I started taking a look at what Horror movieswere being shown on the big screen. Finding Vincenzo Natali's Haunter(which has the same "hook",but a darker tone) to be superb,I wasexcited to spot a film on the big screen with a similar set- up,whichled to me joining in the Death Day.The plot:Waking up with a killer hangover on her birthday, Theresa "Tree"Gelbman pushes fellow student Carter Davis to the side,and spends theentire day being grumpy to everyone,from binning a birthday cupcake herroommate Lori makes,to ignoring her dads invitation to meet up (Tree'slate mum had the same birthday.) Going to a party later that night,Treeis stopped in her tracks by a masked stranger,who gets out a knife andkills her. Expecting to be dead,Tree instead finds herself re-livingher birthday (where the same person kills her.) Caught in atime-loop,Tree starts trying to find out who the masked killer is,inorder to stop her unhappy death day.View on the film:Setting the timer,the screenplay by X-Men Comic-Book writer ScottLobdell spends the opening 15 minutes cheekily ribbing the clichés ofthe Slasher genre,via Davis being the well-meaning pretty boy,Treebeing the popular,mean "it girl", and Tree's entire clique being basedaround showing the nerds who really is too cool for school.CatchingTree in a time loop,Lobdell gives the shiny Slash shocks sharp,underlying psychological terror, as each time she is murdered,leads toTree getting increasingly raw fears that she will never escape theloop. Along with slicing up over a dozen, weapons- grade "Final Girl"battles, Lobdell takes an excellent stab at Horror-Comedy, that shinesin each attempt Tree makes to survive the day,from Tree walking roundthe campus care-free and naked,to the headache Tree gets of having tore-live a deadly morning routine.Perfectly stepping in time with Lobdell, director Christopher Landon &cinematographer Toby Oliver turn the Slasher Knife with an irresistiblePop-Rock atmosphere,of whip-pans around the campus,and neon lights overthe killings that creates a party mood. Backed by a jumpy score fromBear McCreary and a great mask designed by "Ghostface" creator TonyGardner, Landon gets into the Slasher groove with ultra-stylisedtracking shots following Tree and the psycho,and overlapping slo-moeyeing the wear and tear Tree experiences in the loop. The only oneaware of what is happening, Jessica Rothe gives an excellentperformance as Tree,whose sarcastic dry-wit Rothe hits with a realrelish,that transforms into a tough, thoughtful confidence,as Treewishes her killer a happy death day.
