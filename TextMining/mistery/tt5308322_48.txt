When the Universal logo goes into a Groundhog Day/Edge of Tomorrowroll, its not hard to guess the plot of this film, especially when theloathsome leading character meets her demise within the first tenminutes, and then rewakes takes the audience onn her investigativejourney as she gets to live the next 18 hours again.This results in a myriad of different days and scenarios reaching thesame conclusion. No point in telling anyone how it ends, just go alongwith this amusing Christopher Landon film and you will enjoy it as muchas his last screen outing the really good 'scouts guide to the zombieapocalypse'. The comedy horror genre has got itself a good talent longmay his reign continue.The cast are good, the running gags work, the only disappointment isthe lack of gore. The soundtrack selection offered my ear a load oftracks that I had not heard before, mind you I'm not the targetaudience for the soundtrack downloads.Worth a watch, just try to find a screening time where the phoneobsessed and plastic wrap scrunching morons are not in attendance
