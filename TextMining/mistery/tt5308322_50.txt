Happy Death Day is a movie about a university student who, on herbirthday, manages to get killed by an unknown masked person. After theexperience, she wakes up and realizes that she is reliving said day.While she is repeating this process, she decides to begin tracking downthe person who is repeatedly slaughtering her.Now going into this movie I didn't really expect that much. A horrormovie such as this one simply looked like one where jumpscares would bevery common. To an extent, I was right; there were a lot of jumpscaresin this film and only a couple were effective. The first one, forinstance was effective because you couldn't see it coming, but theystopped being effective directly afterwards because I had an idea wherethe plot was going to go with every repeated day. In a way, the moviefails at being a horror due to its predictability. This movie also hassome major plot holes that I would discuss, but that would dive intospoiler territory.As for the stuff that I enjoyed in the film, it does get entertainingsometimes and many of the jokes were pretty funny. The relationshipsbetween the main character, the love interest and the dad eventuallybegan to grow on me. If there's one thing that the movie somewhatsucceeds in as a horror, it's the fact that it does deal with some ofthe repercussions of fear and what it can do to one's body and that'skind of scary when you think about it.Overall I really did enjoy this movie when it felt more like a dramedy.However, when it turns back into a horror film, for the most part HappyDeath Day turns into an ineffective horror movie that is intended onusing predictable jumpscares as a means to scare people, leaving thataspect of the films very weak.6/10
