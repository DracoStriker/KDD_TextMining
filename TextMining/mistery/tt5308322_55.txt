Taking a popular trope and splashing it onto a teenage thrasher doesn'tdo much for this dull horror release. The strangely named Tree Gelbman(Jessica Rothe) is a shallow sorority girl who goes through her dayselfishly blowing off others and insulting everyone she knows until sheis murdered. She wakes up to find that she is repeating the same dayover again but this takes a little longer than it should, especiallysince they advertised this film a lot and audiences are here for theconceit. She's murdered again and freaks out as she wakes up in thesame position. No matter what she tries, she keeps getting murdered bya mysterious figure who wears the baby mascot mask. The murders are notvery clever but the killer is very determined to take out Tree.Tree keeps waking up in the dorm room of Carter (Israel Broussard), aguy she drunkenly went home with last night though he did not have sexwith her. As she goes through repeated trauma, he turns from a totalstrange into a trusted ally that she asks for advice. He is skepticaleach time the day resets but entertains the scenario and gives heradvice of using her many lives to investigate who wants to kill her.She investigates the people who might hate her like the sorority leaderDanielle (Rachel Matthews) but she rules them out right before she getsmurder. The inevitable montage of repeated death plays out as shereduces the suspects. She was having an affair with her doctorprofessor Gregory Butler (Charles Atiken) but eliminates his wifeStephanie (Laura Clifton) as her murderer.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
