Jessica Rothe is amusingly pithy and savvy playing a selfish collegebeauty, a spoiled sorority sister who rules the school until she isstabbed and killed on her way to a surprise birthday party by a maskedlunatic. But fate plays this campus cutie an unusual hand once shediscovers she's living her birthday over and over again, each timeattempting to cheat death but always running into her attacker.Screenwriter Scott Lobdell isn't trying to sneak a slasher variant of"Groundhog Day" passed us--he's upfront about the similarities, evenexalts in them, while toying with all the possibilities such a scenariocan offer. It takes Rothe three tries to fully comprehend what'shappening to her; once she formulates a plan (creating a suspect list),Lobdell mixes things up, so that the movie rarely feels repetitive. Ourheroine, snarky to start, follows Bill Murray's example and becomes abetter person on her twisted journey (reestablishing contact with herfather, apologizing to her roommate, even causing her own demise on oneoccasion to prevent the cute nerd from the boys' dorm from losing hislife). Director Christopher B. Landon deserves credit for delivering amodern-day thriller with lots of action but no gore and no nudity. Ifit isn't quite a family-friendly slasher flick, it certainly is asquirrelly, sassy one, with some big laughs counterbalancing thesuspense. Good show! *** from ****
