This movie is very underrated and I will explain why. It was prettyscary at some moments, it was pretty funny on some others and generallyit succeed to make you feel connected to the main character's feelings(Jessica Rothe) who by the way was pretty amazing at her job. I lovedthe movie from first to last minute and had really great time watchingit.
