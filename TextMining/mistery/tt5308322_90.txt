I'm not going to deny it, I adore slasher flicks. They almost never getmade anymore unless they're sequels or remakes, so when I saw thispseudo-slasher, I was instantly excited, even though I thought thetrailer looked a little goofy. I had no idea the film was a horrorcomedy, and great at giving us both. The one montage in particular isabsolutely hysterically funny. I thought the killer was a littleobvious, but it was a satisfying twist. tree was a great protagonist,and I'm a fan of the lead actress, knowing her from La La Land and herMTV show, Mary and Jane. A wonderfully fun slasher, with a cute romanceand a deliciously biting dialogue. I adored it.
