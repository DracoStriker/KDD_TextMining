If you are going to watch it keep in mind this is not a pure mysterythriller it will disappoint you if you're expecting that. But as acomedy slasher mystery thriller it becomes watchable if you don't haveanything else to see but it still has flaws. It's predictable andchanges between suspense and comedy seemed dumb. Some things justdidn't make sense and certain situations felt unnecessary. Still youcan enjoy it but it's not a good movie nor bad just something to see inyour free time.
