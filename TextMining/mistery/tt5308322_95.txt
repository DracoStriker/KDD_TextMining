To me, the movie does not work. In the theatrical trailer, you seeevery one of her "deaths". And, since it is a PG13, what you see in thetrailer is about as much detail as they show in the movie.Really not much point to this film other than trying to play thewhodunnit game. Obviously, once revealed, your mind immediatelyaddresses all of the problems with this resolution. Not for me. Didn't work. Trailer revealing everything did not help theexperience either.And before you think, "Why does he even watch the trailer if he doesn'twant it spoiled?" I am a firm believer that a good trailer is one thatdoes not reveal every single surprise.
