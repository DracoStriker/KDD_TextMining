Yet another teenage horror comedy, this one its much more lacking inthe horror department than I was expecting it to be, it has a fewdecent suspenseful scenes and some slightly funny moments but itsmostly just uninteresting, predictable, dull and obnoxious.This feels like a made for TV Lifetime movie that went to theaters, itskind of like "Scream" in many aspects they are both annoying, they areboth dumb, and they are both rather decent when it comes to the actualhorror scenes. The main lead is a brat, really unlikable, even when shegets done with her character arc she remains somewhat irritating, BillMurray could get away with saying douchy lines and still being likable,he was known for that, we rooted for him in "Groundhog Day" because wewanted him to be a better person and to be happy, the girl in thismovie is decent at delivering the lines but you never feel like shecould be a nice person.While the comedy in movies like this its often hit or miss, I will sayits mostly miss here by having characters say predictable lines orbeing exasperating just for the sake of it.The director is Christopher B. Landon, who wrote many "ParanormalActivity" movies and directed "The Marked Ones" after that he went intoteenage horror comedies with "Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse",looks like he couldn't make a decent horror movie so he decided to"make fun of them" with these awkward juvenile movies like "Happy DeathDay."
