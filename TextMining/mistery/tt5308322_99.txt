As you may already know, this is "Groundhog's Day" plus a slasher.Teresa (Jessica Rothe) is a coed who makes the rounds. In any horrorslasher she would never be the final girl and typically the first oneto die. In this film she is indeed the first one to die only to wake upagain to relive her birthday again...and die again. She formulates aplan to find out the identity of the killer who wears a baby mask.The film was cute and clever. Jessica Rothe is not new to horror,having been in "La La Land" which would have been better had theykilled people early and often instead of letting Emma Stone die a slowand agonizing death. Please God, don't let her sing again. Well worth aview for those who adore comedy horror. Loved the twist.Guide: Caught 1 F-word. No sex or nudity. Minor groping. Sex talk.Note to self: In case of slasher. Use stairs.
