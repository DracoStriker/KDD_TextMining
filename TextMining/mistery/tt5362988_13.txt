An FBI agent teams with a town's veteran game tracker to investigate amurder that occurred on a Native American reservation. Wind River wasone of those films that i did not expect to actually go and see inTheaters but i'm so glad that i did this is a small budget indie movieand something very much different than Jeremy Renner and ElizabethOlsen usually do especially since they both star in 'Avengers'. This ismore of a character study drama than your regular action film and itpacks some great heavy performances especially from the 2 main leads infact Renner delivers his lines with a terrific way, his role isn't justdramatic but he can pull some actual punches of his own both as anactor and as a character, Olsen is kind of the rookie type of characterbut she is not weak or a character that is annoying in a sense of wayshe can actually pull off the acting chops just as good as Renner andboth of them should get nominated for something until the end of theyear, Gil Birmingham and Graham Greene also gave 2 terrificperformances as well and you do get some great moments from the NativeAmerican Culture. Like i said this is more of a character study dramaabout fathers and daughters and how a parent learns how to overcome orbasically try to understand that his child won't come back also thereare some great suspenseful scenes and some really great actionsequences that will totally blow you away, the direction that the movietakes is very good and it's full of great shots left and right plusthere's an unexpected cameo from a fan favorite actor and the whole'who did it' scenario is clever even tho we have seen it many timesbefore. Overall this is a great movie and i would totally recommend youto go and see it in Theaters but just know what to expect this isn'tAvengers 3 it's a film about an awful tragedy and a bunch of bravepeople who wanna know what the hell happened. (A+)
