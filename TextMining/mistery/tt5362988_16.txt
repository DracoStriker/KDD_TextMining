i completely disagree that this movie should be categorized as athriller or mystery. The story has a predictable outcome that I couldsee coming from the beginning. The writer did nothing to try and evenlead us in a different direction. In the first ten minutes the vicitimsfamily leads us to a boyfriend no ones ever met. Obviously they'regoing to try and find him, once they do we're hand delivered the entirestory. There was no work for the audience to do and zero surprise. Ikind of like being lead down a few different paths that can bemisleading before letting us know what really happened and who thekiller is. I found the characters to be predictable from Thetracker/hunter male that's good at everything And always figures it outbefore the young female law enforcement character that's in over herhead. Throw in the local cop that's a bit slow and blasé about his job.It's been done a 100 + times and I think it's been done better. I'mactually starting to wonder whose reviewing movies. I'm sorry but 8/10on IMDb when there's many many more movies that score 6/10 that havebetter story, writing and acting. Was this movie awful? No. It's not aterrible movie but it's definitely just average.
