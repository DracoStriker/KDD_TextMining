Jeremy Renner is cool as f***, but that's nothing new. Wind River gotgood acting and fantastic pictures of raw nature but what it lacks isimo a suspenseful and captivating story, so I wouldn't call Wind Rivera thriller or a crime/detective story but more kind of drama about lossand being lost spiced up with some hunting and shooting. Not bad, not exceptional, but okay, thanks to the good acting and thegreat supporting act called nature.
