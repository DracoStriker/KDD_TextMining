This movie had a lot of good things going for it. Great, sceniclocation. A good cast. A decent story to start out with. But, it's likethe editor or whoever screened the story had their head in the sandwhen it came to big events that happened in the movie and how theaudience would react. I won't even get into the FBI agent / high NativeAmerican shooting scene which didn't make any sense.Let's talk about the climax. A group of local police officers and anFBI agent head out to a drill site to look for the boyfriend of thevictim. Shortly after arriving the security at the drill site attemptsto flank the cops and one of the local cops notices this and calls themout on it. Guns end up being pointed and of course the heroine (FBIagent) has to step in and calm everyone down. As soon as they put theirguns down she should have arrested them on the spot. Instead shechooses not to listen to the local cop and basically almost dismissesthe security guards as a threat. Of course, the security guards killeveryone but her. Fast forward to the end of the ending of the movie... Jeremy Renner gets his revenge but nothing is even mentioned of thelocal police and police chief that were savagely gunned down. Also,Renner convinces the FBI agent that she wasn't just lucky to havesurvived. What he should have said was that she was an idiot and gotthe rest of her colleagues killed by not recognizing an obvious danger.Left a bad taste in my mouth.
