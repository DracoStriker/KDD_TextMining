Terrible sound track. Either the sound engineer was asleep at theswitch, the Director didn't listen to the dailies, or the actors neverlearned how to enunciate or modulate their voices. As a result, this isa total snorer which makes you want to slap the characters silly untilthey learn to speak clearly.
