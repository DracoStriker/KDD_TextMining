Was intrigued after seeing the trailer. Movie grabbed me from the getgo until we get to Cliché #1: The lead character has a young son whokeeps getting upset because daddy has to keep putting his job first.Finally move beyond that and then the FBI agent turns up giving usCliché #2: Hard nosed female agent, 'battling' backwoods cop andcoroner and anyone else who is not with the program! Cliché#3......didn't get that far. Once Clarice Starling started on her'smarter and more committed than thou' carp I'd had enough. Please, canwe leave family life out of hard core mystery movies. Please, enoughwith the ballsy female fighting sexist, misogynistic, backwoodsdinosaurs. Oh wait, Cliché #3 - if the female lead is leading the chasethen you know she will be the one left standing at the end AND the onewho comes through by taking down or arresting the bad guy. Same oldcarp, different day.
