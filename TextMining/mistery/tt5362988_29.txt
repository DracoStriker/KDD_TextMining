I'm never one for wanting more screen time for women in movies, orwishing the time they had on screen was better spent, but even I felt abit sorry for this actress. Her role as an FBI agent was so ridiculousthat it just ruined the whole movie. She was continually inept to theextent she couldn't even dress herself appropriately. I think the movie was trying to make some point about Indians v themodern day world? White men still raping their land by drilling? And inthis, that rape actualised by the rape of a girl. If it was, then itwas utterly lost on me. I didn't care. I couldn't catch a single wordanyone said, so whatever message was being pushed was too inarticulateto bother with. Do they not test movies on random audiences these days?Actual paying audiences?I didn't care about the death of the girl because we never met her orknew anything about her. I didn't care who killed her because we'dnever met them either, and when we did they all looked alike. There wasno build up, just wham, bam, everyone is dead. And then we had ridiculousness beyond ridiculousness when punishing thebaddie the "hero" (these terms are relative these days) gives him theopportunity to try and escape in the snow. The girl he beat and gangraped made it six miles. He makes 600 feet. Ah, but she was a ...warrior. Dear Lord. Where do they get these writers. An 18-year-oldgirl, beaten unconscious and then raped by five men after a night ofsex with her boyfriend, and she can run barefeet in the snow for sixmiles BECAUSE SHE'S A WARRIOR. You couldn't make this rubbish up. Oh,they did.Don't bother. The snow is lovely though.
