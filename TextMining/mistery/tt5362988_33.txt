This movie should have been great.. It had potential to really be agreat film. The Jeremy Renner character was great.. He really pulled itoff nicely.. The Elizabeth Olsen character wasn't nearly asbelievable.. but OK. I don't see how it got the high marks it did. ButI only have one opinion. There were some really stupid executions in the story telling.. Irolled my eyes a few times at some of the scenes.. Ridiculous stuff. And then there was the lazy film-making style of going hand-held withthe camera. There are scenes in this film that are almost unwatchablebecause of the hand-held camera jitter. I understand at times it addsto excitement - ala the street scenes of The French Connection.. Butthis film wasn't using hand-held to add to action. Clearly most of thehand-held was done to make the film easier to make. There were evenjittery hand-held scenes of two people having a conversation in aliving room.. Un-necessary and really takes away from the film. I am glad I only paida couple of bucks to see the movie.. if I had paid full price Iprobably would not have felt like it was worth it..
