Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a hunter working for Fish and WildlifeService. He is brought in to Wind River Reservation to hunt down ananimal in the mountains of Wyoming and discovers the frozen body of adead local girl. Ben (Graham Greene) is the tribal police chief. NewFBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to investigate thecase. She faces jurisdictional conflicts and cultural intransigence.This is very much in the tradition of In Cold Blood. The characters arewell-drawn. There is a sense of place. The violence is brutal. Theshootouts are shocking, abrupt, visceral, and intense. There isn't muchof a mystery. It's more about a straight forward investigation. Thescene with Cory confessing his lost to Jane is something different.Although I appreciated it, Jane getting the information from his wifewould be more compelling in the traditional sense. Jane would knowsomething about Cory without him knowing about it. When the perp is onthe run and sees the porcupine, I fully expected the mountain lion tojump him from behind. There is a poetry to what Cory does to him. Thisis a brutal and effective crime drama.
