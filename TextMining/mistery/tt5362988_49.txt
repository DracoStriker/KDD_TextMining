Taylor Sheridan wrote 3 really good stories in last threeyears(Sicario, Hell or High water), but this time he was also adirector. His direction gave us something special in terms of makingactors to do their best and show them where to give importance tospecific scene or parts of dialogue. Jeremy Renner gave us a great performance, he really showed us his painand ways to confront it. Chemistry between him and Elizabeth Olsen waspretty good. I was a little bit suspicious when i saw Gil Birminghamand Graham Greene duo from Twilight *hahah* but they were good in thismovie especially Gils character Martin who had similar destiny asJeremy character Cory and they have created a special bond and thatparable was through the whole movie.Taylor realistically present us harsh life of people living in thenorth and all negative things that could happen to that people outthere. Comparasion and rivalry between Native Americans and thesettlers is one of the main object in this movie and showed that theymust live and fight together if they want to survive.I liked this movie and i advice Taylor to direct his own storiesbecause he knows best what is important in the movie and he can showactors how he imagine all the characters.
