OK, allow me to preface by saying I am a movie buff and pride myself inbeing totally objective when watching a movie. I regularly check outthe rotten tomato new list and their scores. I often times cannotfathom the interest in movies like la la land and or the manchesterdisaster. Well I thought i had heard and seen it all until this wind river epicfailure. I read the reviews and I like the actors so i sat down with achica friend of mine, which i purposefully study movies beforesuggesting them to her, and we proceeded to watch this disaster. Suffice to say i can tell if im going to like a movie (like a Scorsese)within the first few minutes. So the movie starts. Dialogue, snow,mountains, more dialogue, mountains, snow. An hour in and nothingchanges. At this point im like wtf? i don't care about the story. Idon't care about the subject matter and i don't care about thecharacters. Finally an hour and change into the movie we get someaction, but its redunculous. A bunch of law enforcement officerspointing their guns at each other and screaming. Gude gawd help me. Iget a laugh out of the positive reviews. I like sending them as a joketo the gal that watched the movie with me. EPIC FAIL.......
