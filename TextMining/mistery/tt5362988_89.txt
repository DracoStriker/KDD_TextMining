Certainly not a regular popcorn movie, but one that makes you think. Acompelling story with a lot of nice shots of the country, whichcontrasts well with the misery. The despair and hopelessness of theyounger generation is tangible. Renner is a cool dude, though I amstarting to doubt his acting range. Seems he's pigeonholed as the(action) man of few words.I agree with the criticism that the movie seems to says that it takeswhite people to solve the problems the natives have.
