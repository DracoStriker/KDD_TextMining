I'm not going to pretend I'm a professional critic and write a novel-length review...that's just pretentious. But I do want to say this:Logan Lucky sucked. It wasn't even remotely funny. It was extremelyslow, dragged on, and the ending--I ticked the spoiler box just incase, but believe me, there's nothing to spoil--the ending felt so muchlike a cheap, lousy cop-out. Lousy, lousy, movie.
