Logan Lucky did not receive many stellar reviews on this site but Iwould recommend it nevertheless. If you are looking for a serious heistfilm with serious characters you are not going to like this. But if youwould like to see a fun film with offbeat humour that does not takeitself too seriously, about a group of hillbillies trying to pull of asuper challenging robbery and where everything is over the top, fromthe story to the characters, than look no further. It has some goodjokes, great performances from Daniel Craig and Adam Driver and a greatsoundtrack. Give it a chance if you would like to relax and have a fewlaughs on the account of the protagonists of this film.
