I'm not trying to compare this with Dirty Harry in any way, I'm justplaying with the words the title is giving us. And of course thatapplies to the movie in a sense too. I understand if people might gopredictable and convenient on a couple of things. But the movie stillhas a lot of twists and turns along the way, to make it interesting.We have Channing Tatum who does carry this movie quite well, though heis helped a lot by the supporting cast around him. If you like capermovies and the thrill of them, this is one movie you will be interestedin. If it depends on how this ends, you have to look at other reviewswho may spoil this. I won't do that and let you find out ... I thinkthey chose the right way to go ...
