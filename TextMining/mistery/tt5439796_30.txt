If this is a comedy movie, then I will stop here. But when youadvertise a movie as something by the team who has presented Oceans11/12/13 then we do expect something different. I went to see a heistmovie, so I was expecting huge thrill and twist. But I don't know howthe movie end. It had fun, it had great cast, great plot. But it didnot happen well.May be my expectations were larger than what they have presented buttrust me it felt like a Bollywood movie. With weak story and alwaysrush to the end. Did not expect that at all.
