After a summer of remakes and so called blockbusters i popped along towatch this with no hopes or misgivings...I hold an unlimited card sowent knowing the cost was immaterial.What I found was typical of the kind of movie you decide to just takein because I have a card and 2 hours to spare..A little cracker of a gem to finish off the summer.Some people are complaining about it not being what the trailers saysit is...but if you know about movies then you should know that theynever are.A very well made " Just watch it" movie which never takes itself tooseriously and makes you smile and chuckle from start to finish.Everybody is in on what this movie should be..in my opinion somewherein between "Stir Crazy" and " The Italian Job" ...with a pinch of "TwinPeaks" added to the recipe.Surprisingly cheerful and just what the doctor ordered for theonslaught of the usual rehash and part 2's and 3's. The only way to make up your mind is to suspend your senses and dabblewith this for a while.
