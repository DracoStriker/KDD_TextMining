I liked it even more after reading Steven Soderbergh's interview aboutcutting out big studios from the profits and sharing it with the crewinstead. Good for him! "The film is also an answer to questions he'sbeen grappling with his whole career: What if you could make a moviethat cut out studios entirely, allowing the filmmaker to do as he orshe pleased? What if infamously shady studio accounting could bereduced to something as simple as a password-protected website, whereeveryone involved with the film? from the producers to the costumedesigner to Adam Driver? could simply log on and see how much money thefilm had made, and what percentage of that money was theirs?"
