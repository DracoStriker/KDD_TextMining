Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is written as your stereotypical countrybumpkin. He has a brother that attends bar and a friend in jail. He isdivorced and his wife has full custody of his daughter, which is not anissue, except they are now moving. Jimmy gets an idea to rob theCharlotte Motor Speedway, a place he was just let go.The film initially reminded me of "Masterminds" as people plan arobbery who you would not expect to plan one. The star studded castperformed well to make an entertaining light comedy as they performtheir "Ocean's 7-11." My biggest criticism is that I don't think thescript writer has any notion of the distance between Charlotte, NC andWest Virginia.No swearing, sex, or nudity.
