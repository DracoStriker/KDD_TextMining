The only reason I didn't check my watch is because I wasn't wearingone. What a waste of a great cast and characters.This movie is mildly entertaining for the first 30 minutes. It doesn'tgo downhill from there; but it kind of meanders along like it is lostin the woods and never finds its way home.The skeletal structure is there for a great film; but there is no meaton them bones. There are no laugh out loud moments, only a few chuckleshere and there.
