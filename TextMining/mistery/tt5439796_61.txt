Seems like there were two directors on this film ... The first directorcreated scenes that parodied poor people in (not) great accents. Downtrodden white trash with no chance of rising above their station??funnyha ha.The other director made poignant scenes--like when the kid sang CountryRoad at the beauty contest. Also, the interplay b/w Tatum and his childwas great. Mostly, I wish the second director made the entire film.
