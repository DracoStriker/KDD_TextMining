For this film, it's simply a case that you are going to hear enoughreferences to Ocean's 11 when any reviews come up, and that is natural.The film even mentions it at one point to make it clear to avoid anycounterclaims.We have a blue-collar family who decide to pull in a convict & hisbrothers to help complete the robbery of a lifetime at a local giantspeedway circuit.The film is mostly for laughs, and thankfully without any glam. Sadlyit does lapse into clichés on blue collar white folk which isunnecessary, but actually this film sympathises with them, and youbegin to really empathise with the characters. Adam Driver as one ofthe lead two brothers is really excellent in his role, and is the oneyou root for most in his but Channing Tatum also plays his part wellwithout resorting to anything typecast.Ably supported by a good cast, and a story line that doesn't need to goat breakneck speed with big scores or rock soundtracks, this is a fineeulogy to the south.I enjoyed it, the only problem is some of the lack of originality andthe at times blue collar clichés which are cheap. It's a fine filmotherwise, and you'll enjoy it.
