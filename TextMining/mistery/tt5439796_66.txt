I consider myself a Soderbergh fan. I loved Side Effects, Magic Mikeand Sex, Lies and Videotape. I respect him for his movie on CheGuevara. I was very surprised to see this film. It was borderlineoffensive and although mildly entertaining in parts, did not deserve tobe made.Many of the characters are caricatures based on what people in LosAngeles probably think rural people are like. I've been to WestVirginia and I don't recall hearing people talk with exaggeratedhick/Southern accents. The whole premise of the movie seemed to be"Look, those people you thought were dumbass hicks can sometimes besmart!" To say that's condescending is an understatement.The heist was a convoluted, Rube Goldberg-like absurdity. Nothing thathappened bore any resemblance to real life. There were two brightspots: Daniel Craig's performance, and a scene featuring the JohnDenver classic "Country Roads." Also Soderbergh sticks in a dig or twoabout smart phones and social media, and that made the film lessstupid.We know that Soderbergh can do better, so why doesn't he?
