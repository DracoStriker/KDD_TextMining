Steven Soderbergh has returned to big cinema with a new heist movie.Unlike his previous Ocean's movie franchise, this time everything isslightly less glamorous. Instead of Las Vegas we have Charlotteville,instead of a casino we see Charlotte Motor Speedway. While the locationdoes not look like a world-wide known, the actors in a movie may beeasily recognized by anyone nowadays. Deniel Craig will still playJames Bond, Channing Tatum will soon be seen in the new Kingsman, andAdam Driver will appear again in the Star Wars franchise. However, herethey are all far being heroes (at least not at the first sight), theyhave all lost something in the past and will probably do it again. Theyare all simple, straightforward, and constantly get into troubles. Inthis movie Soderbergh does not seem to make some over-effort, butpresents a product of good quality. This is a typical Soderbergh movieboth build under the successful recipe of Ocean's Eleven andsimultaneously playing with some genre clichés. Of course, since therelease of Ocean's Eleven Soderbergh has experimented a lot, both onthe big screen and on TV (the Knick), and his style has changedsomehow. Still, if you like his movies you will probably enjoy this oneas well.
