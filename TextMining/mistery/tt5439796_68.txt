This film sneaks up on you, starts out with just enough characterdevelopment for you to buy in, adds a little red-neck humour and charm,and then, "BANG", it turns into a cool and intelligent heist movie.Subtly done, Mr. Soderbergh! The best film of its' genre since InsideMan. P.S. 1. Wind River. 2. Baby Driver
