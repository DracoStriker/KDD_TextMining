Well, this one made me sign up, and I'm write my first review ever.Okay... And I'm doing all of that not because it's like the best movieof the year or anything, but because how strongly I felt to express howgood it is, compared to other movies that I thought were some of thebest of their genre; and I'm talking here about Ocean's 11 & 13. Forquite some time I thought they were very good, and Ocean's 12 assomewhat artistic. But boy I think differently now; Ocean's 11 & 13 areyour typical popcorn flicks, with some nice visuals and catchy sceneshere and there. That's it, Nothing more. But on the other hand, LoganLucky is subtle at sometimes (in a good way) and exciting at others,with some very good performances by the main cast. Which makes it oneof the best of in its genre.
