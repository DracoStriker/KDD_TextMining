Meh. Movie reviews show this movie as a hit. The movie has some funnyparts, but the whole move is just OK. Too much slapstick comedy andmost actors performance is mediocre. Not worth the full price ticket.Oh well, they all can't be winners. Now I am trying to fill the fiveline requirement to meet the IMDb requirements. Movie didn't deservethat much of my time.
