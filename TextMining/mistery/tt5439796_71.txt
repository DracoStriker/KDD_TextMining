Southern humor is faster than this. The real conflict may not be knownuntil one is more than half way through. Don't expect it all to beperfect all the way through. I mean if one is patient, calm, and canjust watch this slow movie as it is, then you can enjoy it. Otherwise Isaw a few leave the theater. I was glad to see it all and was patient.You will know more after you have seen it. Best
