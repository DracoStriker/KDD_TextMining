Logan Lucky is a fun fictitious heist caper. I think if one is going tomake a story of this type up it helps to have the ingredient of humor.This one has that element woven well throughout. The story itself,though somewhat sensational, reels itself in to keep just enoughcredibility to have a feel of something possible. Again, this helpsimmensely. Then there's the setting and the characters which breathessome freshness into a well worn genre. Now I'm not going to tell youthat Daniel Craig as a southern talking backwoods legendary criminalwould be the obvious choice so just watch and see if he doesn't slipinto this role better than one might ever imagine. The exaggeratedwoodsy drawl used by many of the actors is just another thing thatoften fails yet works right into the comedic part well. Soderbergh gota good story, a great cast, and worked it into a better movie. Addingstuff like having Dwight Yoakum as the prison warden and Hilary Swankas the dogged, but stuck, FBI agent is pure gold. Tatum Channing doeshis role justice by not overplaying which is when he hits a sweet spot.All in all this is an enjoyable ride.
