I'm sure there was a context to understand about Lucky Logan andperhaps meaning to unearth but what I got most from Lucky Logan (in themost complimentary way possible) was good fun! It wasn't a challenge toget drawn into the plot despite not completely following all steps ofthe Charlotte speedway heist. The pace of the plot was very punchy anddid keep me consistently entertained and I don't mean trashyentertainment I mean high nutrition well shot, written and cast,entertainment! I, like so many, am guilty of unconsciously assumingDaniel Craig's repertoire to be pure 100% undiluted, Bond. So I wasmagnificently satisfied with Craig's character 'Joe Bang' as the actorhas a strong comedic instinct and physicality about him. I was weirdlyenergised by Craig's portrayal of this eccentric bomb virtuoso, and Ihope the world will be graced with more Craig comedies. I thought thatall the characters worked tremendously well together like a goodrecipe. Tatum played the flawed yet doting and determined dad with realconviction and had a really endearing energy with his on screendaughter. Mellie, the sister was also a really great character! She hadall of your classic visual Hollywood signifiers of a ditsy female withher transparent tops and short skirts except FINALLY this wasn'texploited by the film and the character herself was sharp and savvy andhad a respected authority in the film. I thought Lucky Logan had a great sense of visual narrative in detailslike the painted cockroaches, jelly beans in the bomb and the repeatappearances of Joe Bangs favourite; two hard boiled eggs and salt.There was some really well composed shots particularly ones includingthe strangely artistic stripy prison onesies. I thought many steps ofthe Heist where very comic and creative and kept me laughing andengrossed throughout.
