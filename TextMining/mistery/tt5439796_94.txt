Despite the film being an all around good time, it's a very subtlebrand of humour. If you're going in expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy,you're gonna be disappointed. I mean, I enjoyed myself but it was anexperience that contrasted with what I was expecting of the film. Thebulk of the cast does well despite this, especially Adam Driver; hesteals every scene he's in.The direction and cinematography were both top notch, in contrast withthe editing, which was very sub par. There was a lot of room to makemultiple humorous edits throughout the film, yet these opportunitieswere wasted.
