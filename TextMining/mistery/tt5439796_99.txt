Steven Soderbergh is arguably the king of comedy capers, especiallywhen it comes to the leading comedy-heist flick 'Ocean's 11', and once'Logan Lucky' made an appearance, thus ending Soderbergh's"retirement", it was a flick I just had to see.All-in-all, 'Logan Lucky' is an entertaining and well-executed comedyheist film with some brilliant characters and a smart conclusion...much like 'Ocean's Eleven'... in fact, too much like 'Ocean's Eleven'.For those who haven't yet seen the 2001 heist film, 'Logan Lucky' willbe a more appealing watch due to its intriguing structure, creativecharacter development and quirky tone to the crime genre, however thoselike myself who have seen Soderbergh's fantastic 'Ocean's Eleven' willjust see this film as a near-enough rip-off of the project with no realunique take on it, apart from it being set in West Virginia / NorthCarolina with a blue collar family leading the caper, rather than a LasVegas suave- fest. But despite it all, as I say above, this film isstill an entertaining watch and gives us a break from the over-the-topsummer blockbusters that are starting to become the bane of thecinematic industry.Channing Tatum and Adam Driver both have a real chemistry as thefictional brothers in this flick, with the support of Daniel Craig'sJoe Bang in the mix (with a rather entertaining accent in allfairness), likewise to Seth MacFarlane for his rather interestingEnglish accent which he actually pulls off quite well. The charactersare the strong point of this film, with interesting character arcs andsmartly-executed development through flashbacks and narrations, alwaysundertaken with a comedic twist.I think one other slight drawback here was that there was no realvillain or obstacle to overcome (the heist aside), there was neverreally much of a reason for them to hit the speedway other than earninga bit of cash, whereas in 'Ocean's Eleven', we had Andy Garcia, who wastruly despicable and someone we were hoping would get ripped off...that level of hate wasn't really present with any character in this,but once again, this aside the characters were still interesting enoughto keep the film running.Finally, if you have seen 'Ocean's Eleven', then you have a prettyclear idea on how this is going to end, admittedly there is a smallpart in the end which caught me out a bit and left me clueless untilthe reveal, but it was pulled off in a similar manner to Soderbergh's"predecessor" (as of such). I have nothing against this film, and Ithoroughly enjoyed it, but obviously it's level of uniqueness failedwhen it came to story and structure, but the engaging characters andhumour helped it stand as a great watch.
