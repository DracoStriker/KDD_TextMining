Deep and long simmering hatred is stirred up when Captain Blocker, anexperienced and capable yet bitter western war veteran, is ordered tolead the transfer of a small band of Cheyenne from New Mexico toMontana. Blocker is enraged because the band includes Yellow Hawk, thekiller of his friends. Forced to go, Blocker puts Yellow Hawk in chainsfor the long ride. The unlikely travel companions meet up with agrief-stricken woman in the burnt remains of her home. She cradles adead baby in her arms and hovers on the brink of insanity. Worse, theunstable and dangerous men who massacred the woman's family are now ontheir trail. Sympathy for the woman as well as the desire forself-preservation begins to unite the Cheyenne and the soldiers.There are wonderful film themes to digest including the understandingthat hostility can come from anywhere or anyone. We are all potentialhostiles. It is a sight for sore eyes to watch the characters travelthrough beautiful prairies and wildlands. Actors including ChistianBale, Wes Studi and Rosamund Pike, perform impressively. While theactor chemistry is a bit off and much time is wasted in uselessblubbering, there is an uncommon, important and intriguing Americanhistory lesson here. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.
