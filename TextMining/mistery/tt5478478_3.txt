One of the best of the year is an interesting story, great music,wonderful acting and best poetic photography, inspiring and sadmasterpiece of American West American film antiques. The gorgeous Paledeserves the best actor of the year and a strong representation of Pikedeserves the best supporting actress. I'm glad I saw this movie in Lastweek the festival of music is still spinning in my mind of its beauty.I give this film the full mark 10/10
