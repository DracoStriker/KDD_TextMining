I loved the Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg pairing in The Other Guys.It was honestly one of the funniest comedies of this past decade. Theactors have good chemistry and can play off each other well. I didn'tlove the first Daddy's Home, but the film had enough decent comedicmoments to keep me interested in a sequel, especially with the additionof MAD Mel Gibson and John Lithgow. Overall, its what you'd expect fromthe film, not overly memorable and gets lost along the way but itoffers comedic moments and a good time.It's holiday season and both Brad and Dusty are co-parenting their kidsand seem to have found a common ground. Enter Both their dads (playedby Gibson and Lithgow). This sudden shakeup provides to be a test forthem and their families as they explore problems and try to find waysto have an awesome Christmas despite all the trials and shenanigansthat now present themselves. Mel Gibson is not in many films these daysso this was a pretty rare appearance for him. Also, we have more JohnCena.I feel like the jokes are at times predictable, however some of themare able to land. Its a film that didn't need a sequel especially apredominantly holiday themed film. Lithgow and Gibson and more Cena isnice, but you can't help but feel they needed better material and arewasted a bit in the film. The film can't help but feel formulaic at atime where a creative approach to a holiday comedy would have workedbetter. Its more or less on the level of the recent A Bad Mom'sChristmas.The film gets distracted with its Christmas theme and holidayshenanigans that at times it is at the expense of comedy. I think thefilm had the cast and makings of a better comedy but a bit of thepotential is wasted. Don't get me wrong, its funny it just could havebeen much more with the talent at its disposal. Still overall, it makesfor a decent viewing experience during this time of year.6/10
