100% chance of this movie being silly and ridiculous, so why go if youexpect anything else? I was pleasantly surprised because Daddy's HomeTwo was much better than the first one. I laughed so hard I criedthrough the whole thing & the rest of the audience was laughing rightalong. The chemistry between the characters is great, and the oneliners are hilarious. I plan to watch this every Christmas.
