Daddy's Home 2 is very similar to its predecessor. If you liked thefirst one, you'll probably like the second. There are a ton of cheapgags and Will Ferrell gets in situations that should have left himhospitalized constantly. The introduction of Mel Gibson and JohnLithgow as the grandfathers just takes the opposite dads concept to theextreme as they are even farther out versions of the Mark Wahlberg andWill Ferrell characters. Most of the jokes weren't worth more than achuckle, with the exception of an extremely relatable thermostat bit.The ending was stretching the limits of believably, even for aridiculous comedy, but all in all it was solid ideal entertainment.Mel Gibson brought the best comedic moments, largely because hecharacter was really playing into the Mel Gibson tough guy persona andit felt more natural than the other characters. Linda Cardellini wasable to do more with her character as she was given a couple scenesalongside Alessandra Ambrosio, whose cameo was expanded into a fullfledged role. Ambrosio was successfully hidden in her scenes to avoidexposing the fact that she is a model, not an actress. John Cena wasalso credited as returning in his cameo role as well, but I never sawhim, though the other characters acted as though he was there.
