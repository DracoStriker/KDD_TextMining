Life is a stage and where else would you meet so many characters but inyour own family.I loved them all: The show stopper was Mel Gibson who played it real as the alcoholicmacho sex addict grandfather. He just can't connect with others except through his macho masculinityand antagonizing others."I may be a lot of things but I am not a heathen" Mel says.Like a lot of us Mel loves the story but not the walk.Like his other half the step grandparent (high functioning autistic) hejust wants to connect but can't.Welcome home Mel. It is not the trauma that makes us sick but the inability to expressthe trauma: Blended families, divided loyalties, alcoholism, and people with neurodifferences: high functioning autism.This film is a heavy hitter extremely funny: comic relief a perfect10!!
