THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017) * Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman,Barry Keoghan, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Bill Camp, AliciaSilverstone. Odd, strange and frankly taxing on the nerves sci-fi dramaabout the very wrong relationship between a teenage loner (creepy asf*** Keoghan) who gloms onto the cardiologist (Farrell in a trulyone-note you wanna slap so-hard turn) who was responsible in the deathof his father on the operating table unbeknownst to the doctor (atfirst) until it is revealed that the fate of his family will suffer thewrath of the mysterious boy. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos - who co-wrotethe frustrating screenplay with Efthymis Filippou - continues tobefuddle and anger audiences in attempting to become a new M.NightShamalan (um, not a good thing at all) - with impossible silentsituations and moments where you want to scream at the screen "Are you****ing kidding me?!!?" An attempt at a parable from the darkestrecesses of The Twlight Zone comes off more as a metaphor of ego andrevenge.
