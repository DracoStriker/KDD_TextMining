I saw this film yesterday, within the panorama for European filmfestival in Cairo, Egypt And i was greatly disappointed...for a film towin in a renowned festival like Cannes ,it has to have brilliantelements,which this film sadly came short of Slow motion, boring ...unnecessary nude scenes..that could have been avoided easily withoutharming the course of actions nor the script..dull film...sillyscenes..allow conversations..i fell asleep literary towards mid film...Apart from acting of main characters Nicole Kidman and ..collin Farrelthe rest of actors ..had average level of acting nothing amazing . Thelobster ..was by far better ,,original and more creative in all aspectsthan this film ( same director) This film is a revival of the Greekmythology of killing a precious person in your life in order to saveyourself and others.but i believe it could have been executed waybetter than that I don't recommend this film.
