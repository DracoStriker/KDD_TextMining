This got a rave review in my daily paper. It's not getting one from me.Weirdness hits a new high.Surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) recently lost a patient on theoperating table. He's taken young Martin (Barry Keoghan), the patient'sseriously weird son, under his wing. Martin is dating Steven's cutedaughter Kim (Raphey Cassidy). Her young brother suddenly loses the useof his legs. Then Kim does too. Steven and his wife (Nicole Kidman) areat their wits end. WTF is going on?You may well ask. To underscore the strangeness of the story, the movieis mostly scored to a cacophonous barrage of pure noise, painful to theears. Colin Farrell, bearded and beefed up from the super-hunk we areaccustomed to, plays with deadly seriousness this man whose world iscoming apart ? reminiscent of Regan's mother in THE EXORCIST. Kidman,whose role is more akin to Mia Farrow's in ROSEMARY'S BABY, often looksas if she is as flummoxed by this script as we are. The theme isRevenge (that dish best eaten cold).Greek writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos gave us THE LOBSTER two yearsago. Here, as there, there's a glossy sheen over the production which ?with the weirdness ? reminded me of an Almodovar movie. Perhaps it wasjust the soundtrack, but I left the cinema feeling slightly sick.
