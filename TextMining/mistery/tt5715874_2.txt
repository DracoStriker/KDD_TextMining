Saying that the "The Killing of a Sacred Deer" is just a greatpsychological thriller is at least undermining... This film is full of brilliant metaphors, but you have to know Greekmythology and history to understand some of them. When Agamemnonaswanted to go to Troy to fight with his ships, there was no wind and hecould't get there. So he asked the Gods to throw some strong winds, butthe Gods replied that he had to sacrifice something in order to get thewinds he desired, so they told him he had to kill his daughter.Agamemnonas thought about it and he decided to kill his daughter, butwhen he was just about to kill her, the gods transformed her into adeer, so he killed a sacred deer.That's where the title of the movie comes from and you can easily guessthe reason..So this film is about choices, sacrifices and revenge.But revenge fromthe Gods. When Martin can bring sickness and death to Steven's wholefamily, in fact martin is in the place of a God from Greek mythology.And his duty is to bring the justice and punish those who overestimatedtheir powers and tried to play gods( Steven went to do a surgery drunk)In addition to that, this great film of lanthimos, gives a harsh criticto the modern way of living in the western societies. Alienation, fakegoals, fake relations and money that that bring comfort but nothappiness.In conclusion it's a great film that gives you much homework to thinkabout when you get home after you watched it and surely much more thanjust a great psychological thriller that many people believe it to be..
