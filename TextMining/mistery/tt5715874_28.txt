Wow.Just wow.Sorry for the repetition.It's not easy to reinvent cinema; but Yorgos Lanthimos is doing justthat.He's pulling in Hollywood A listers to put in career definingperformances in his movies and hey, with a Greek shrug of hisshoulders, he's pulling it off.Agamemnon would cheer; I think.This is a great piece of work. It's art house and it's extremelychallenging, but nobody left the screening I was at, despite severalflinching moments.I can't review this on a plot basis because it would spoil it entirely.But I will say it's a masterpiece in direction, superb acted by allthree main protagonists and darkly hilarious, although not many in theauditorium laughed.And beautiful.Just beautiful.
