I give this a rating of 7 because the film held me spellboundthroughout and the acting was great. But the flaw of it is a common onein American films these days. There is one scene where you have to stayalert for, as it's crucial to understanding the ending, and the commonflaw comes into play here: the dialogue becomes breathlessly mumbledand incredibly fast. The spoiler alert is me playing it safe, as I wantto let you know the scene to listen hard to. It's when Colin Farrell'scharacter enters his child's hospital room and finds young Martin atthe bedside. Listen carefully to what Martin says before leaving. I'vedocked the rating of three points because of this frustrating thing,but if you're hearing's good, it's a very spellbinding film.
