Yorgos Lanthimos seems to have inherited the mantle of the great LuisBunuel, for this movie, like its predecessor THE LOBSTER, isessentially a satire on humanity's prodigious talent for not takingresponsibility for its actions. The mythical underpinnings here givethe film a sure sense of direction and overall structure, butLanthimos' style is all his own -- the restrained, almost deadpan,performances he elicits from his actors; the pared-down dialogue,teetering a lot of the time on the edge of very dark humour indeed; thealmost antiseptic visual canvas which takes so little to sully. This isPlanet Yorgos.It's two hours of almost non-stop psychological disturbance, so prepareto emerge a little punch-drunk, but it is totally worth undergoing theexperience.It's worth mentioning in passing that the performances are terrific,and that Colin Farrell goes from strength to strength now his juvenilelead days are behind him.
