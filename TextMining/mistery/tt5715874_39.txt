Colin Farrell is a cardiologist who has taken teenager Barry Keoghanunder his wing. He meets him in secret, dispenses advice, gives himgifts and ultimately introduces him to his family ... Nicole Kidman,Raffey Cassidy and Sunny Suljic. It gradually becomes clear thatKeoghan has some hold on Farrell, which is brought into stark reliefwhen Farrell's family starts coming down with a mysterious illness.Farrell has to make an enormous sacrifice to avoid tragedy. Theperformances are universally amazing here, especially given the odd,extremely restrained style that Lanthimos is going for. This is a slowfilm that takes place in very bright, very still spaces. It's veryreminiscent of Kubrick. Definitely not for all tastes, but if you'veseen Lanthimos's earlier films, this is clearly the work of the sameman.
