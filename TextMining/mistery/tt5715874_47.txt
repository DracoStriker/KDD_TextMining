Going to the cinema with high expectations was surely not the rightthing to do. After the director's marvellous masterpiece "The Lobster",I expected a bigger movie - bigger in direction, screenplay, actorensemble, and budget - since The Lobster received many accolades and anOscar nom for best screenplay! However, his new movie seemed as if it was actually filmed before "TheLobster" - a dull, white and unappealing setting (mostly the hospital),not an ensemble cast or switching scenes + an unattractive and annoyingyoung boy as the young protagonist.I actually watched it till the end with enthusiasm because of ColinFarrell and Nicole Kidman - I really like their work and acting andthey never disappoint. Also, hail to Nicole for having such a greatyear ahead! They had some great scenes together which make the movieworth to watch. The most annoying part must be the recurring unsettling & loudorchestral music to force the effect of: "Hey, you are not watching aslow-paced drama with no elements of thriller or action, it is going tobe so exciting and spooky right now". ...and the "bloody violence" orscary, spooky scenes never came, actually. Wished Nicole Kidman had more scenes, though. She was too passive. Iwanted her to smack the boy or do the final act herself which I won'ttell ya not to spoil the ending.I hope we get more lobsters in the future than deer - they were not sotasty, after all!
