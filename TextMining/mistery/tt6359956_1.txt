As a huge fan of comedies that bring some laughs and escape to thisworld, and as a huge fan of well-known stars letting their hair downand having goofy fun in an R-rated, raunchy romp, I couldn't wait tosee this sequel to "Bad Moms," which I mostly loved and have nowwatched multiple times. Adding Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon, andCheryl Hines to the original cast seemed like a perfect match--howcould it go wrong? In my mind just letting this group of talentedactors improvise on the same set would guarantee big laughs, especiallywith Kathryn Hahn sparking the mix. I went to a "paid advancescreening" a week before it opened to the public, plunking down mybucks without any fear of first checking reviews--I was that sure itwould be at the very least filled with some laugh-out-loud moments, andplenty of amusing ones, well worth my time and money. Imagine mysurprise, and disappointment, to find that the film is loaded withtired clichés of mother-daughter relationship problems, with nothingfresh or funny to offer, old jokes and sitcom situations you've seendone (much) better dozens of times on most any TV family sitcom, andthat the script is so poorly-written it truly would've been better tojust give the actors an overview of what the film was about and letthem improv the whole thing. Finally it ends, and you're left with analmost embarrassing dance/romp during the closing credits that issupposed to be a celebration of the "joy" of the film and itsproduction and cast, with the actors having a bit of an on-screen danceparty as the credits roll. Instead of feeling that (forced) joy, I leftthe theater depressed and saddened at the waste of money and talent,and the waste of my time and money as well. Easily, for me, one of theworst "comedies" I've ever seen--and I've seen hundreds over thedecades and my lifetime.
