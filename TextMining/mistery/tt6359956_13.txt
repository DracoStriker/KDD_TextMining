Comedy (though that's being extremely generous) Bad Moms Christmas follows the Moms from the original film preparingfor Christmas, however in this film the moms have their own moms staywith them for the few days preceding Christmas day with chaotic moments(None of the female characters are likable).I'm not the target audience, demonstrated by the fact that I was in mylocal busy cinema attended by only 5 blokes (incl. me). There is soooomuch wrong with this film, where do I start?! Badly written, rubbish acting, revolting dialogue! Hardly starts beingfunny and you quickly stop caring what happens next! Child actors usingthe F-word (of which there was plenty) is never funny! Racist in placesThere's every type of lazy humour including overdone sex and clichédjokes! If your idea of funny is frequent and unnecessary F-Bombs then thisfilm is definitely for you. It seemed like every scene contained the'F' word, after a while this wears thin and then you begin to realiseit was being used instead of clever humour. Santa number2 is the onlything awarding this a 1 star. See this if you really must, but when you're drunk and the incoherentplot won't matter! No out-takes either ? oh c'mon there must have beenloads! In summary, this film is utter garbage, it'll make you want topoke your eyes out with hot pins. Fvcking awful, I sh1t you not! ? stay away.
