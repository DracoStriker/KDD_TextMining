Nice acting, decent story, it just didn't make me laugh out loud. Isnickered a little, but I wanted it to be really funny. I guess if youfind kids dropping the F bomb funny, then you might enjoy it more thanme. I like all the actresses, it just wasn't very funny. Maybe if I wasa mom who was tormented by my mother it would have had me rolling inthe aisles, but I don't think so. Safe to wait for it on Netflix.
