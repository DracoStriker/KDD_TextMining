I was excited to see this as a follow up to the first one (which Itruly liked) but this was NOT very funny and the story line with the"older moms" was a bit depressing. And where was more ChristinaApplegate? Why just a quick cameo? The scene at the mall could havebeen funnier, had it been a touch more realistic. Who drinks beer in afood court? They could have gone to a cheesy restaurant int the mall.Stealing a tree from Lady Foot Locker? Really???? Was that anadvertising plea? I did enjoy Sexy Santa guy from "This is Us". He wasgreat. The scene at SkyZone was OK. But overall this was corny and justnot funny enough. I couldn't wait for it to end. Sorry Not Sorry.
