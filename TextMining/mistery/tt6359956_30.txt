The bad moms mothers are coming to visit for the holidays. Mila Kunisis horrified at the prospect. With Christine Baranski as her mom whocan blame her. I have been a fan of Baranski since the days of theCybil TV show. Shes very funny in this movie. Giving her grandchildrenthe most extravagant gifts. Insisting the family has to see the realfive hour long nutcracker not the Disney version. How the most gocaroling to all three hundred homes in the area. If they are going towin the caroling prize.Don't worry she hired back up singers.Decorating the outside of the house that goes way over the top From thebad moms Mila Kunis is easily the most likable. The rest of the actorsare OK. Its rude,crude and pretty funny I was smiling a lot through thewhole movie.
