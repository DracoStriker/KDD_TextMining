I don't understand the bad reviews on this. I'm not sure what peopleexpect from this type of movie, but for me it delivered everything Iexpected and more. There were plenty of ruptures of laughter in thecinema I was watching it at last night, so generally I would say mostof the people in there enjoyed it too. It's basically a laugh a minute.Like the first movie 'Bad Moms' you get a something different from eachof the female leads, but they are all funny in their own way. It wasthe best comedy I've seen this year, the right blend of silly andserious with a lovely family Christmas message. I'd recommend you don'tlisten to the the hard to please people on here, and you go see it andmake up your own mind. I can't wait to watch it again over Christmas.Great fun.
