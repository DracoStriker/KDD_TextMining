This movie is stupid and ludicrous, but a riot?gratuitous in itsR-rated language and sexual content, and fully boasts its awesome castin several outrageous ways. After feeling out our moms (Mila Kunis,Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn) in the first film, I really now see andunderstand how the unique characters bring out the most in one another,and it felt more organic as a result. The 104-minute run time felt justfine to me and not overlong, but there was one subplot of this film Istill could have done without and did not add much to the story, andremoving it would have brought it down to a tight 90 minutes.The Christmas theme is integrated right into the plot and is a freshway to pitch the sequel, and the grandmoms help induce the strugglingrelationships that one could find in a hard-hitting melodrama: onewhose mom has unrealistic expectations for her daughter's motherhood,one who wants separative space between herself and her mom, and one whowants more closeness to her mom. It sounds very general, but whenwithin the right framework (when not clouded by the film's foolishness)it hits as very real when it tries to. While the first film really feltto be "for moms" in that there is a general message that will make themfeel important walking out of the theater, this sequel tries to delivera similar thing with the grandmothers to a lesser effect.Now that there are two comedy sequels releasing about parents' parentscoming home for the Christmas holidays, the similarities stop there andaudiences have a choice between seeing: men/women, naughty/nice, orcrude/slapstick. I'd say for the appropriate age, A Bad Moms Christmasdelivers on more fronts than Daddy's Home 2 (which I also saw a pre-screening for, by the way); regardless, prepare to turn off the"suspension of disbelief" switch and prepare for a decent abs workout.Neither the first film nor the sequel are anything special, but theyalso aren't a complete waste of time and money for how absurd they are.
