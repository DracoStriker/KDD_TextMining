This is a film that suffers from sloppy or possibly the absence of ascript. There are several funny moments in this train wreck tiedtogether with a lot of WTF script. It's mildly raunchy- we watched itwith kids ranging from 10 to 17 and hadn't expected that based on BadMom's the original. A lot of the humour is adolescent and the kidsthought it was funny. I laughed at several scenes. This movie iswatchable but don't expect a great movie. This film is better than theworst reviews. Yes it's a sequel of a less funny but better scriptedmovie. I mentioned that there are several moments in this movie thatwere funny- laugh out loud funny- I don't recall laughing out loudduring the original- which had mildly amusing moments but with a scriptthat actually was more coherent.While I'd not likely ever watch either Bad Mom's or Bad Mom's 2 again,I would watch 2 over the original.
