After feeling outour moms (Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn) in the first film, Ireally now see and understand how the unique characters bring out themost in one another, The 104-minute run time felt perfect from the waxing to robbing footlockers Christmas trees to Ruth spoiling her grandchildren and thenthere kiki dumb but fun there Santa's stripper's very fun there a lotof Christmas heart and a donkey in a house The Christmas theme isintegrated right into the plot and is a fresh way to pitch the sequel,and the grand moms help induce the struggling relationships that onecould find in a hard-hitting melodrama: one whose mom has unrealisticexpectations for her daughter's motherhood, one who wants separativespace between herself and her mom, and one who wants more closeness toher mom. It sounds very general, but when within the right framework(when not clouded by the film's foolishness) it hits as very real whenit tries to. While the first film really felt to be "for moms" in thatthere is a general message that will make them feel important walkingout of the theater, this sequel tries to deliver a similar thing withthe grandmothers to a lesser effect. Now that there are two comedysequels releasing about parents' parents coming home for the Christmasholidays, the similarities stop there and audiences have a choicebetween seeing: men/women, naughty/nice, or crude/slapstick. I'd sayfor the appropriate age, A Bad Moms Christmas delivers on more fronts ,prepare to turn off the "suspension of disbelief" switch and preparefor a decent abs workout. but they also aren't a complete waste of time and money for how overthe top they are but the film makers are expanding the bad momsuniverse will it be bad grandmas 10 out of 10
