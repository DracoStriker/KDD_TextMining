While my personal Bogey favorite is still his Sam Spade in 'The MalteseFalcon', his cynical nightclub owner, Rick, in 'Casablanca', is also astandout. Rather than some "off the cuff" comments, I'll quote instead frommy article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) thatpretty well sums up the film:"It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue,that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen'ssmoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film fromHumphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renaultwho investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screenclassic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB directorto whom it was just another assignment.  It went on to win the Oscar forBest Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceivedjust shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogartknowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartimeaudiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francenand Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominatedfor Best Supporting actor."And by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black andwhite photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's.Incredible nonsense!!  As a matter of fact, the film's black and whitecinematography was nominated for an Oscar!Ingrid Bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and Bogeywas firing on all six cylinders. Great chemistry! As time goes by, we still have 'Casablanca'...
