Spoilers herein.Bloom said of Shakespeare that he invented humanity. Films will always haveless depth than poetry, but they can have a similar, profound effect onpopular culture. Movies are seldom about life, but life is often about film,the few films that find the groove.This film invented -- to a substantial degree -- what it meant to be apost-war American. It is not so much that it was perfect, but that we haveremolded ourselves around it, as part of the victor's healing.I recently saw some other Bogart films (like `Treasure'), and they amazed mein how poorly they worked. How mannered his acting seemed.We have beautiful faces in other films, even this face (which we still havein Isabella). But nothing seems to compete for the certain archetype ofpassionate commitment, of pathetic yearning, of immature desire, of refugeedesperation.The interior sets -- and how they are photographed -- show a definite post`Citizen Kane' influence. In fact, one can see much of the Mercury Playerflavor in these characters, particularly Greenstreet.But you know, this film has so melded with dreams that you don't need toscreen it.
