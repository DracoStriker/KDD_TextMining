Saw this classic in DVD format the other night. I must confess that itlooks just as good as I remembered it. Michael Curtiz's film is acurious one. It enjoys presently perhaps more popularity than when itoriginally made its debut in 1942. As new generations discovered thepicture, they made it a timeless film, and generations to come willalso be charmed by it.The story of Rick and Ilsa and their impossible love affair will besomething to be treasured by film lovers forever. Casablanca in the 40swas a hot bed of intrigue; lots of people tried to get there, butperhaps leaving the place was harder because the red tape of that eraand the fact that the Nazis had a way to spoil a party. In a lot of ways, this is a dated film. By today standards it would bepolitically incorrect. But ultimately, we all fall under the spell thatMichael Curtiz created and for almost two hours we are in Casablancaamong the spies and would be travelers eavesdropping into theirconversations and the different schemes going on.Humphrey Bogart was an actor without the looks of some of the handsomemale stars of that era, yet, he is mesmerizing as Rick Blaine. It wouldbe hard to imagine another actor playing Rick other that Bogart. IngridBergman was at the height of her career when she made the film. Herchemistry with her co star is one of the best things going, since theymade it believable.The rest of the cast is flawless. Paul Henreid, as Victor Lazlo, cutsquite a figure and it is hard to think Ilsa would prefer Rick to thissuave and sophisticated man. Claude Rains is good as Capt. Renault.Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.K. Sakall, and aboveall Dooley Wilson, as Sam, made a magnificent contribution to the filmin small roles.Casablanca gets better and better, as time goes by.
