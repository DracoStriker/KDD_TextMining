Everyone remembers 'As Time Goes By' (the song that only stayed in the film,so popular culture has it, because Bergman had cut her hair for 'Joan ofArc', and couldn't retake scenes using another tune) but there is much moreto this world-weary romance.Bogart, of course, was hardly the usual romantic movie hero.  Which ispossibly what makes him so perfect for Rick, in his Casablanca nightspot, onnobody's side.  He spars with Claude Rains (the crooked police captain) andSidney Greenstreet (a rival bar owner) like a trooper, has a quiet contemptfor Paul Henreid (a freedom fighter) and Peter Lorre (a thief), gives ConradVeidt (the Nazi Major) as good as he gets, is on the level with employeesDooley Wilson and Cuddles Sakall.Through all this, truly loves Ingrid Bergman (the beautiful Ilse, the loveof his life).  It is their story, but not the story you might expect.  Thisis the secret, I think, of 'Casablanca' and its lasting success.  From themoment we see the map and the film title to the 'beautiful friendship' lineat the end, we're hooked.   Every performance is a lastingjoy.
