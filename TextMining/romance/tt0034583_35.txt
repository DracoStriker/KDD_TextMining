Roger Ebert said this about "Citizen Kane," "If I were ever stranded on adesert island and could only watch one movie "Citizen Kane" would be theone." I feel the same way about "Casablanca." I think it has a muchbetterstory line than "Citizen Kane" and it didn't need inovative camera shotstomake it a truely unique movie experience. And, it has some of the bestdialoge ever written in a movie.Ex.Strasser: Why did you come to Casablanca?Rick:      I came for the waters.Strasser: This is the desert!Rick:      I was misinformed.Score one for Rick!They don't write them like that any more!
