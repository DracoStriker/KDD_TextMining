This is a movie so flawed it is in danger of falling apart. Bergman iscold,confused and remote - unconvincing as the woman who dominates the lives ofthe mysterious and highly respected American Rick Blaine, and the muchsought after inspiration of the resistance Victor Laszlo. The Parissequenceis corny and embarrassing producing one of the worse lines in cinemahistory- "Was that cannon fire or is my heart pounding?" Yet this film remains myall time favourite. No matter how many times I see it I'm still moved. Igetgoosebumps when Laszlo encourages the staff and customers of Rick's tosingLa Marseilles in response to the Germans singing. I smile at the jokes. Imelt at the supreme sacrifice at the end. I nod knowingly at thereferencesto America's neutral stance in the war. I admire the theme of commitmentandsacrifice in a time of stress. And I love the colourful, quickly drawncharacters given vivid life by smooth, confident actors such as ClaudeRains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Why does it work so well? Is itBogart in a white suit? Is it the impressionist tour de force openingwhereevery character and every theme is introduced in a fluid journey throughRick's bar? Or is it the totally unpredictable and totally originalstory-line the conclusion of which could never be guessed, but which feelsso right, so heroic, so romantic, so awesome. "Here's looking at you,kid!"
