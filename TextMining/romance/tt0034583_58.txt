"Who thinks 'Casablanca' is the number one movie of all time?" That isa game many play, but I refuse to play it, because I don't think itmatters. I have seen many movies over the past five decades, and'Casablanca' is one of my all time favorites. It is set in a mysteriousplace at a very mysterious time, and has many mysterious figuresrunning through the story. It has war, it has friendship, it has love,it has sacrifice. All the elements combine to form an entertaining butgripping film that always seems as fresh as the first time you viewedit.This is perhaps my favorite Humphrey Bogart role, as Rick Blaine theexiled American who owns and operates his own gin joint. We know heisn't totally a good man, but we also sense that inside he is not a badman at all. Mostly he just wants to do his job and be left alone. Butdanger lurks at the turn of every page of script.Most SPOILERS follow. The crux of the story involves Rick, Ilsa (IngridBergman) and Victor (Paul Henreid). Rick and Ilsa have a history, theyparted under suspicious circumstances when she failed to meet him atthe train leaving town. Now she shows up with a husband that Rick neverknew she had. Victor and Ilsa want safe passage to America, and Rickholds the papers that can get them there. Still in love with Ilsa, herealizes that true love will give her what she needs, and he does. Safepassage for her and her husband.Casablanca has quite a good ensemble cast, with stars in their ownrights Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Maj.Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, and PeterLorre as the shady Guillermo Ugarte.The DVD is superb!!
