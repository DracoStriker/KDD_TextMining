While there's not anything new to be said about "Casablanca", it's good tosee one of the classics still getting some attention.  By most standards itis at least very good, and there are good reasons why so many still rememberit so fondly.  Not everyone who watches it today shares the opinion that itis a classic, but it's still good to see fans of modern movies giving it atry for themselves.The cast is one of its main strengths, not just Bogart and Bergman but alsothe fine supporting cast.  Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and the others areindispensable to the atmosphere and the story, and each has some very goodmoments.  It does have its imperfections, but it was not expected to be aclassic or blockbuster - everything you read about the production suggeststhat it was made in a rather slap-dash fashion, under constraints that wouldhave wrecked most other films.  It's not hard to see the little ways thatthis affected the finished product, such as the times when the plot strainscredibility a bit, or the characters seem to behave somewhat oddly.  (Inparticular, it might have been even more satisfying if Bergman's characterhad been a little stronger - Ilsa is charming, but that's entirely thanks towhat Bergman does with her; the character herself as written seems somewhatshallow.)But it turned out anyway to be an excellent combination of actors,characters, and story, a combination that more than makes up for everythingelse.  Different viewers probably remember and enjoy "Casablanca" fordifferent reasons, because it seemingly has a little of everything.  Whileperhaps not perfect, it is well worth remembering and watching.
