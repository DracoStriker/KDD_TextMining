Probably the most legendary movie of all time, I finally got to see it, itwas a great hole in my movie-viewing history. And finally I got tounderstand why a classic movie like this has made its mark in history. Theintricate political plot comes first, and sets the movie on a melting pot ofthe second world war, where everyone hopes and dies for an opportunity toreach the USA via Lisbon. This would provide sufficient material forhundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificentcinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some ofthe best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THATsong, and history was made. More than 60 years of jaw-drops are sufficientto give the sceptics a good reason to make them understand that this isprobably the greatest classic movie of all times, and one of the best evermade in the past, present and future.
