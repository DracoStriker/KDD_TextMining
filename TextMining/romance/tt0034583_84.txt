For a film that is so highly spoken of I never really was too eager to seeit. I suppose it's because of what some would term as "hype" others wouldterm as "overkill." But some would term it as "tribute." Anyway, I didn'tfeel like it was a must-see. I THOUGHT I knew the story. I didn't. I THOUGHTI knew the lines, I did, I THOUGHT I knew the music, and I did, but onlywhen I see this movie over and over do I begin to appreciate Bergman'sacting, Bogie's finesse, and Steiner's music. Ever since I saw"Carrotblanca," I remembered that I should really try to see this one. So atthe first opportunity, I bought it, watched it that very night, and unlikeDoctor Zhivago, this one actually kept me entertained and sympathized withthe characters. It's an amazing story, I'm surprised people have actuallythought this was a boring film... though for action-loving dudes onmotorcycles in leather and gold chains might find it so.NO ONE PLAYS IT LIKE SAM!
