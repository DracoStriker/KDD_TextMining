Not much can be said about one of the most glorious accidental triumphs inmovie history. The right stars, the right supporting cast, the rightdirector and particularly the right script came together magically for thebest movie in Hollywood history.I often say that this movie is like Stairway to Heaven - it has been rippedoff so many times, that to watch it now for the first time can make it seemfull of cliches - as long as you were aware that it was this creation thatstarted all the cliches.Briefly, the plot concerns the coming together of half-a-dozen main playersin Casablanca during the middle of the second World War. Humphrey Bogart isthe archetypical softie with the hard, cynical shell, Paul Heinreid is awonderfully noble leader of men, Ingrid Bergman truly makes you believe thata man could obsess about her for years.  Claude Rains is wonderfullydevillish as the corrupt prefect of police, Sidney Greenstreet positivelyMachiavellian as a business rival and Peter Lorre incredible as a cheaphood.Watch this movie, and for the love of all that's holy, make sure it is inthe original black and white!
