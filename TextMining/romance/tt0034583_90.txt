This is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It transcends time.  Thescript is just pure poetry.  Sure, some of the supporting actors are alittle stiff but Bogart and Bergman have a chemistry that has never beencaptured on screen again.  The ending is the best 15 minutes of film ever.Anyway, can't say enough for this movie.Chris
