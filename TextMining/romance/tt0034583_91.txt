For whatever reason I kept putting off watching this film.  I knew so muchabout it, including its ending, and for years meant to see it, but thought,"what's the point?"  After watching it last night I remembered what made mea movie fan in the first place.  Movies like Casablanca.  I was astoundedwith how influential this picture was.  I knew Raiders of the Lost Ark wasinspired by the old Saturday Afternoon Serials, but I had NO IDEA how muchit had taken from "Casablanca."  The shots, the cinematography, the stagingof characters, even the clothing.  So many movies were inspired by this film(some were direct rip-offs).  I may go as far as to say that this is themost influential film ever made (along with Citizen Kane)!  I absolutelyloved it.  No matter what type of film you favor, you'll find something tolike about this movie.  Don't make the same mistake I did and put it off fordecades.  It's well worth a rental or even a purchase!
