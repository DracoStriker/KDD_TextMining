Well golly gee whiz, I don't even know where to begin with this one. Toits credit, it does have energy ... lots of high voltage zing and zest,hyper kinetic hubbub, in that optimistic spirit of high school days,with all that singing, dancing, and chattering like magpies. And theproduction design and costumes are colorful and splashy."Grease" also has two terrific songs that function as musical bookends.At the beginning, we get to hear "Grease (Is The Word)", sung byFrankie Valli. I've always liked that song. And near the end, JohnTravolta and Olivia Newton-John dazzle and electrify with the snappy,pulsating sounds of "You're The One That I Want" ... "oo-oo-oo, honey".Marvelous.Trouble is, both those songs engender a 1970's disco flavor into a filmostensibly about the 1950s. So where are all those really greatoldies-but-goodies? Sha-na-na sings a few oldies, like Elvis' "HoundDog". But the missed musical opportunities are striking.The film's story, about high school romance, is not original. And theplot is choppy, and lacks scene transitions, or any sense of logicalprogression or flow. Plot points seem placed almost in random order, aresult of poor script structure.Although the film is a comedy, the jokes aren't really funny. Thewriters are trying too hard, and the humor comes across as forced andunnatural.One of the worst elements of "Grease" is the "Greased Lightning"segment, which has John Travolta acting like a jerk, as he struts andprances in an auto garage. Wearing too much makeup, he comes across asa poor imitation of 1970's singer Freddie Mercury, from the 1970's rockband "Queen".The film's casting is terrible. Most of them look too old to be highschool seniors. Not for a microsecond did I think Stockard Channing was17 years old.What's good about this film is really, really good. And what's bad isreally, really bad. But overall, "Grease" fails to engender a sense ofthe 1950s. Instead, it looks, sounds, and feels like an homage to the1970s disco era.
