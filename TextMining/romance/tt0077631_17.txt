Talking about movies without an argument, talking about nonsensicalmusical extravaganza, talking about glorification of frivolity,talking... Well, let the images do the talking. I just didn't catch themovie way back in the seventies and kept away from it in the eightiesand nineties, but heck, you certainly run out of luck one day and youcome to see this... (fill in your favorite gut revolver). As somepopular character said, "we were idiots back in the fifties", and itwould be great for the movie to point it out; problem is that itcelebrates the whole idiocy of the times, making satire only to theclichés and actually selling the real misery of social uses and customsas nostalgic empathy. The whole macho pose on which the supposedconflict is based finally rears its ugly head in all its disgrace andthere is dance and joy everywhere to enthrone it. As entertainment italso lacks punch and, of course, intelligence, for the purpose seems tobe an exhibition of pseudo-romantic gags and ill-conceived phoneyhumour. On the other hand, the movie is excruciatingly dull evenskipping the sung parts. Not difficult to categorize with an adjectiveor two, but from my personal point of view, the ideal film to watchwhile you write the note to the judge and proceed to hang yourself.
