This is my all time favorite movie. I have seen many great movies butGrease will always be the best. Yes its corny, yes its a bit pointlessbut that is what makes it so good!! If it wasn't for Grease JohnTravolta would not be famous, he would not have millions of dollars.Grease made him who he is today. The first time i saw Grease i fell inlove with the movie and i fell in love with John. Every time i watchit, it just keeps getting better and better!! Long live Grease!! Theyhave made those ridiculous High School Musicals now and that annoys mebecause they are trying to match up to Grease, but Zac Efron and hisStupid "Crew" will never be able to beat Grease. Grease is the bestmusical of all time. "Go Greased Lighting you're burning up the quartermile" Grease is the word...
