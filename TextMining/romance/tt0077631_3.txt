I hated this movie when I was a teenager and I'm so pissed at myselfbecause of that. Looking at this movie now in my 20's I can appreciatewhat a fun-loving view of life this provides. All the songs are of atleast decent quality but three of them in particular are just amazing.This is hands down one of the better musicals out there. Thechoreography can't be more well done than shown here. It's funnybecause I liked "Saturday Night Fever" better when I was younger butnow I don't care for that movie and the exact opposite happened withthis one...go figure. Olivia Newton-John is just gorgeous, why shedidn't star in many movies afterward I'll never understand and god whata voice!!! John Travolta was great, and everyone else (especiallyStockard Channing) were all fabulous. Oh and if you ever go to aKaraoke night make sure you do the "Grease Megamix" sometime throughoutthe night as it'll get the crowd pumped guaranteed.Final Synopsis:Movies : I did see this when I was in high school because it wasre-released in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back thendidn't care for it. This is one you can view easily on the silverscreen and enjoy it just as much for a lot cheaper.DVD Purchase : Couldn't resist for only $9.Rental : This could easily be a once a year habit.
