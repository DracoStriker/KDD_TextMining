Is it humanly possible to watch Grease and not fall for it completely?I first saw it when i was but a little girl and it had me singing "wego together, like..." for days and days. Musicals are such a brilliantpart of the film industry, but sometimes the plot is overshadowed byover done, unbelievably bad music and actors and actresses who don'tseem to be there for any reason other than the money involved. But thenyou watch Grease and you understand what it's all about. BANG! Music,tension, romance, car races, brilliant plot... Need i go on? OliveaNewton-John is so talented and so pretty, while John Travolta is theguy of every girls dreams from that time; Bad boy, with a good heartand over styled hair. So, it is the best musical of all time. Even mencan like it with out being accused of being gay. And that's sayingsomething. Grease is the word!
