This movie came out when I was just 1, and I'm amazed by the hatereviews it got. For those of you that hate this, you need to know this:(1) It's a MUSICAL, so what do you expect? In a MUSICAL, people areexpected to sing and dance when they're supposed to because it's calledACTING. It's not supposed to be a real thing. (2) Everyone in the moviecan act and sing, and that goes to John Travolta too. (3) At least it'snot the same thing as High School Musical. What lesson do you think HSMteaches you? Grease teaches you that love is all about makingsacrifices for the other person, because that's just what love is.Those of you that hate this are completely missing the point of what ittruly is about. Maybe next time when you see a film, watch the WHOLEthing first and then you can judge so you don't look like an idiot.Great storyline, great acting/singing/dancing. At least I'm prettylucky to have a film like this come out during my time.
