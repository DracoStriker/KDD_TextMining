I've seen three movies by Randal Kleiser and each time I have beenimpressed. As far as musicals go, Grease is in my top 5. Although Irecently saw Bye Bye Birdie (made in the early 60s) and now can seewhere Grease got a lot of it's "style" from. Not a criticism at all,just an observation.All in all, the direction, the choreography, the music and, of course,the cast all came together for a tight match.John Travolta and Olivia Newton John headed up the very talented cast.They had a great chemistry together. I wondered why they didn't do manyother movies together. The production design and the camera work weregreat too, mixing in a lot pleasant to look at colors. It was a visualcandy bar.
