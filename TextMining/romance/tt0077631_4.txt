One of the best Broadway musicals ever adapted for the big screen largelythanks to producer Allan Carr and director Randal Kleiser set at Rydell Highcirca 1950s with Travolta (in his other iconic role) as leather jacketwearing, hunky hood with a heart-of-gold Danny Zuko recalling his `SummerNights' with Aussie sexpot Newton-John (in her sunny to sultry iconic turn)as goody-goody Sandy who learns some things from The Pink Ladies' tough yettender leader Rizzo (Channing, ditto).  Good old fashioned knuckle-headedcomedy and toe-tapping tunes that will have you dancing and singing along to`Greased Lightning' (imagine Elvis doing this!) , the dance contest'shyper-paced `Hand Jive' sequence and the closer `We Go Together'.  Titletune by Franki Valli. A film I've seen probably a hundred times and nevertire of.
