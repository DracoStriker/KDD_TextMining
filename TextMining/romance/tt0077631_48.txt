I first saw this movie when I was ten, but it wasn't until I was about 15 or16 that I was old enough to really appreciate it. You know, going to highschool in 1959, in the long run, wasn't really that different from going tohigh school in 1997 (when I went), so I enjoyed the movie and could identifywith the characters. One thing I hated about it though: why does almosteveryone look like twentysomethings with godlike physiques? The truth isthat most high school boys are gangly creatures with bad acne andembarrassing falsetto voices, while many girls at that age are stunted,awkward midgets with pillarlike legs. Heck, there are even college studentswho fit these descriptions. Oh well, I guess that's the beauty of cinematiclicense. I love GREASE and hope to see it on stage someday.
