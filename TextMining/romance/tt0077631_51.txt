With more hummable songs than "West Side Story," and a lot more humor,"Grease" is probably the most fun musical tribute to '50s teen culture.It studiously avoids falling into the buzz-killing sinkholes ofmelodrama and social commentary. When a main character has a pregnancyscare, she responds not with self-pity but with defiant independence.That arc leaves her a little deeper, a little wiser than before, but noless lighthearted. The principle romantic pair, played by John Travolta(good actor, lousy singer) and Olivia Newton-John (the inverse) areoften kept apart by the artificial social barriers of high school, andthey each do the silliest things to try to change for each other, butat no point does anyone act as if any valuable lessons have beenlearned. In another movie about pseudo-rebellious greasers, like "RebelWithout a Cause," the car race scene in the final third would haveresulted in a shocking death that changes everything; not here, because"Grease" is smart enough to know what kind of movie it is. It's justfun-loving, winking nostalgia. The final number has all of thecharacters, even the ones who never got along, declare that they willbe together forever. The audience knows that they won't, because lifedoesn't work like that, and the movie knows that we know, so spellingit out would be pointless. In addition to the pop songs and fun plot,"Grease" is kept fresh by well-drawn, instantly-iconic supportingcharacters like Rizzo and Frenchy.
