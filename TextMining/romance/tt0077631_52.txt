When it comes to film and musicals, I am not a big fan. I don't knowwhy, but I can't seem to get into musicals. However, Grease is morethan just a musical. It's practically the way of life. This filmbrought back fond memories of my high school days and this film plays amajor role in my childhood. As a musical, this film has manyfoot-tapping rock'n'roll songs that are very good. As a movie, thisstory doesn't offer anything new, but it's still entertaining and youcare about the characters which I find matters most.Randal Kleiser's film starts off with a young couple, Danny and Sandybelieving they will never see each other again. But little did theyknow, Sandy happens to be the new kid at their high school. Will Danny,a member of a gang, will be able to capture the heart of the girl heloves? The acting is pretty good and memorable. John Travolta and OliviaNewton-John have very good singing voices and they know how to rocktheir hearts out. They are also good actors and this is the film thatput them on the map. The rest of the cast led by Stockard Channingranges from pretty funny and goofy to mildly annoying. Nonetheless,they are important factors in this story as they are the soul toTravolta's/John's heart.Overall, this is a near instant classic thanks to some energizingmusic. Despite the lack of newness, coming-of-age films always hold adear spot in my heart and I will always cherish them and this is whatmakes Grease special. My favorite scene is the ballroom dance scenetowards the end. There are some groovy dance moves here and was veryentertaining to watch, just like the film itself. I rate this film9/10.
