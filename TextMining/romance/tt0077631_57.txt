"Grease" is a movie that i can watch over and over again and it's stillentertaining. This movie has romance, comedy, action, and school drama. Thestory line is perfect for any movie-goer and it's amazing how well OliviaNewton John and John Trovolta match the play. "Grease" will definitelyplease anyone. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
