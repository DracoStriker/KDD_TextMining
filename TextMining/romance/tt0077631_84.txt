I am giving this movie a high rating simply because at the time it wasa phenomenon and to this day has had a cultural impact on pop culture.You can even hear some of the songs in this film on radio now andagain. However, I simply did not enjoy this one. I always get thefeeling when I watch it that it's a girls fantasy movie. I know a lotof men who enjoy it but that's just my opinion. The set design,costumes and music are really good and seeing Travolta in this type ofa film is priceless, and the film still holds up today. I think mostpeople who watch Grease will give it multiple viewings but I am not oneof them.
