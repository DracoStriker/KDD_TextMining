I found myself appalled by Sandy's transformation from good girl toedgy wanna-be. Even though this film has the edgy T-Birds, I foundDanny to be the guy to be hiding his nice boy feelings. I felt Dannyand Sandy were superficially acting to fit in with the popular people.To me, Danny was only "cool" when he was dancing and singing.Otherwise, Sandy and him annoyed me. Rizzo did not annoy me. I likedher singing, dancing, and naturally whimsical attitude. Though, Idislike how she disguised her vulnerability with humor to cope with hersituation to Kennickie. Musically and choreographically, this film istop notch on my end. Characterization-wise, I would say that this filmis not suitable for educating people on how to have healthyrelationships, though.
