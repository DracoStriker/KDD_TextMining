Teenagers Sandy (played by Olivia Newton-John) and Danny (JohnTravolta) have a summer romance but that seems to be how long it willlast. Then they discover that they now both attend the same highschool...Good musical-drama. Basic plot, but the movie is made by the music.Catchy, and keeps the story moving along.Decent performance by John Travolta. Olivia Newton-John is weak andunconvincing in her role though. Supporting cast is solid, though casting in general is a major problem.Who thought casting 20-somethings as teens when they don't lookanything like teens would be a good idea? Doesn't help theplausibility.
