Ridley Scott's "Legend" is a terrific bit of fantasy, a stunninglysurreal look into a mythical world of wonders.Unfortunately, I don't believe what we got here in America *was* RidleyScott's "Legend." It was an impostor. It was a goofy, clunky nightmarefull of plot holes and ridiculousness, armed with a wacky TangerineDream score that ruined the whole thing. That movie was cut down from aperfectly entertaining 114-minute movie with a story that *made sense*and a purely beautiful Jerry Goldsmith score.Does something not seem right to you, too? I have no idea why, forSagan's sake, Universal Studios mangled this movie for itstransatlantic journey. They chopped nearly 25 minutes. They didunspeakable things to the soundscape, and not just by changing themusical score. And tragically, they still kept the scene where you cansee the Lord of Darkness' horns flopping up and down.The American version is hideous (even though I still like to watch it).So if that's the only version you have seen, no wonder you don't likeit! I suggest you go out and rent the "Director's Edition" before it'stoo late! Because the "American Version" really only goes to prove thatsome things (including "The Office") should stay on the proper side ofthe pond.
