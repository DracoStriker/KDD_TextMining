Fantastic movie, especially considering the era from which it came. NoCGI was used in its creation.If you loved Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, you should love(or at least strongly like) this movie.There is the "American version" and the "Director's Cut" version (whichstrongly follows the European version).If you have never seen this movie, I strongly recommend the "Director'sCut/European" version. I cannot stress this enough: there are scenes inthe American version which, to placate the American audience (for"happy endings"), will spoil the enjoyment of the movie.Also, the American cut uses the Tangerine Dream score (which,personally, I enjoyed immensely). The "Director's Cut/European version"uses Jerry Goldsmith's score, which, in my opinion, is "okay".The "best of both worlds" scenario would be if they incorporated theTangerine Dream score with the "Directors' Cut/European version".
