I just cannot believe what comments pop-up on this site! This movie is100% perfection!!! I grew up on it, together with The Labyrinth andWillow. For me it is one of the symbols of the '80s. Everything in thismovie is beautiful, the story, the cast, effects, costumes, masks,music...literally everything!!! One of Ridley Scotts best films!!!First, those who saw this film for the first time after they turned 18are too late to enjoy it's magic!!! When my kid is old enough to read,this will be one of the first movies he will watch. You cannotappreciate the story if you don't believe in the values this moviepromotes. You have a princess, a hero and his friends, the villain andhis minions, a quest, a clear distinction between good and the bad andtheir eternal struggle. What more can you ask from a fantasy?! So don'tjudge this film by todays standards when movies are made just forprofit with a weak story and tons of CGI! If you are under 18 yearsold, you can watch it alone....if not, take a kid with you and ask forhis views of the film after it is over, and then come and put a commenton this site!!! A must see!!! One of the BEST!!!
