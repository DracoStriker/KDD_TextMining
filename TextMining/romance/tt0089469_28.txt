All i have to say is i really enjoyed this movie.  Pretty much everypersonbetween the ages of 6-13 during this time period probably saw it and mostlikly enjoyed it.  Of course it isnt going to be as good in 2004 as it wasin 1985 but who really cares, you watch the movie for the entertainment,notto point out flaws(such as the string).  And by obviously renting the dvdorvhs you can see on the back that yes there are bubbles and yes there areunicorns, but remember this is a fantasy and not meant to be taken tooseriously.  So if you are getting this movie re,member its genre and watchit for what it is
