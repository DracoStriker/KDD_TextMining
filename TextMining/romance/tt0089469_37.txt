It's really frustrating when a studio butchers a film. Why hire greattalent and invest all that money then? A number of films have sufferedthis fate, sometimes never to be seen the way the filmmakers intended.There are however a lucky few directors who've been given the chance toget their version to the public. For nearly two decades, the only cutof Ridley Scott's 'Legend' most saw was the heavily edited theatricalcut. The film still gained a cult following, which likely had somethingto do with the release of this longer, not to mention superior version.Pros: Great performances across the board. Top notch direction.Beautiful score. Rich cinematography. Incredible make-up and visualeffects. Stunning production and costumes designs. Several memorablesequences. Steady pace.Cons: Plot and characters could've used more fleshing out. Story toldbefore and better.Final thoughts: Though still not perfect, this cut of the film is amore satisfying experience. And unlike some other effects heavy filmsof the time, it's held up beautifully. It's also more coherent andgives the viewer more room to breathe. A shame that Scott hasn'treturned to the Fantasy genre, because this isn't a bad first forayinto it.My rating: 4/5
