The Lord of all that is Darkness (Tim Curry) tries to take over theworld by slaying two unicorns. He is distracted by the temptation ofinnocence, which comes in the form of pretty little Princess Lily,played by Mia Sara in her film debut. The Dark Lord decides he wouldlike to have his way with virgin princess, while her true love Jack(Tom Cruise) tries to rescue her and save the world. Long, dark, murky, loaded with black humor and undeniably well crafted.A beautiful film to look at that is hopelessly chopped up in theAmerican version which replaces Jerry Goldsmith's original music withmusic by Tangerine Dream. Cruise is alright as the hero, as alright as he's ever been anywhereelse. Mia Sara is very lovely as the virgin princess whom this filmrevolves around. Curry sounds like he's having fun as the villain.
