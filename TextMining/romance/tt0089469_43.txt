The 80s were a time when the fantasy genre became more mainstream.Dragon Slayer, The Neverending Story, Legend and Willow to name but afew opened the flood gates to a long list of clones and fantasyanimations. Legend was up there with the best of them.The basic story revolves around the basic story of good vs evil, theloss of innocence and the manifestation of this evil by the Lord ofdarkness himself. There was no cgi as it was the early eighties and itgives the film a very authentic feel. All the cast give goodperformances but Tim Curry steals the show as the lord of darkness. Idon't think his character could be anywhere near as terrifying if itwas made with cgi.The score by Tangerine Dream (who Scott also used in BladeRunner)completes the experience and gives the everything a dream likequality almost like your watching a dream unfold on screen .It uses a lot of self depreciating humor to lighten the mood for theyoung target audience it was originally aimed at. Unfortunately thisdoesn't always work and lessens the escapist fantasy experiencesomewhat.Just like Scotts masterpiece Bladerunner, watch both versions (theres alot of extra footage in the directors cut) to fully appreciate thislittle gem.
