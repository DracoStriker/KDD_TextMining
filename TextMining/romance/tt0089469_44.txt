If you see this movie, and you should, watch the directors cut not thecinematic version. The directors cut holds a superior soundtrack inthat it isn't stuck in the 80's not to mention; this version isn't asamericanized as the cinematic one. But as 80's music goes this movie'spretty good. If you, like I, have a fondness of Tom Cruise this too isa movie for you! This shows the Young Tom Cruise before the success,and I do believe this was his debut in a starring role. Before youwatch this movie though, you shouldn't have too high expectations fromit; if you do it might disappoint you. But if you just watch it with anopen, and slightly romantic, mind, it should sweep you away for just awhile...
