As often happens I have again bucked the crowd. A fine director hasgiven us a charming morality tale for adults. It is lush, sensual,sweet perhaps naive, certainly it is charming. I am sorry that I didnot ever get to hear the Goldsmith score, but I thought the TangerineDream score was very fitting. The youthful Tom Cruise was perfectlycast as the forest boy Jack and Mia Sara was just right as the girl.But the makeup job and prosthetics that made Tim Curry the Lord ofDarkness was outstanding. a film with brownies, fairies, Unicorns,goblins. What more could a fantasy film deliver, and a a bonus theplaintive voice of YES front man Jon Anderson singing the song over thefinal credits. I am sorry that there so many people that were notmature enough to enjoy the artistry of this film. I would still like toget the DVD version to see the cut I missed.
