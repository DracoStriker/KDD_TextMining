This movie is Curry's greatest role ever. His depiction of darkness ismasterful. Pure evil in every aspect of the way. The movie itself is decent,but far from good. Tom Cruise is made out to be a hero who is much weakerthan Curry. The movie revolves around the good vs evil, or light vs darknessaspects constantly. The fantasy scenery is good, and the music ismesmerizing. You should see this movie only to witness the best evil evercreated in a movie, because the other characters and the plot leave youwanting a lot more.
