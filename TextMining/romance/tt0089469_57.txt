This is a paradoxical movie.  It is bad and good at the same time.  Themusic is fantastic, the scenery/cinematography is spellbinding, the makeupis out of this world, the acting....mmmm....well, it is the downfall of thefilm, though the roles did not provide much room to maneuver.  Good winsover evil in the end and all is well, and yet, somehow, it manages tocapture that Brothers Grimm-esque dark side of fairy tales.  It weaves aspell that has caught me more than once killing two hours on a Saturdayafternoon on the couch watching it yet again.  Submit to the wonder, ignorethe thinness, and enjoy.
