Spoiler Alert! I watched and loved this movie ever since I canremember. In fact it's one of the first movies I've ever seen that Iremembered beginning to end besides Dumb and Dumber and a handful ofothers. The only thing that I didn't really like at all was TomCruise's acting in the movie. I mean if you notice there are severaltimes in this film where he overacts which kinds of ruins hischaracter. I thought his character should of been silent through about3/4s of the movie. I mean was there really any point of him yelling outin the most annoying way possible, "Lilly!" The whole movie is prettyawesome and very fantasy-like kind of like a Zelda or Castlevania gamewhere the hero is in search of ending a curse. If you haven't seen thismovie I highly recommend it. I mean I see some of the script is kind ofconfusing but it is pretty awesome and satisfying to see. I'm surprisedthey never made a sequel with the open ending it had. I give it a outof 10 because again Tom Cruise's acting wasn't quite right for thisfilm and also some of the story is confusing.
