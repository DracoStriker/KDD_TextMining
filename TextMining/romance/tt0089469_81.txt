As a big fan of fantasy films, I remember watching Legend as a child inthe eighties. I recently watched it again and the one thing that struckme was how long it was. Apparently, I'd watched the 'director's cut'(or extended edition - I forget). Anyway, it ran at over two hours and,although I normally enjoy the director's cut more, this time I found itreally boring.What was a pretty tight fantasy adventure had its first half draggedout, with long periods of little speech or where anything happens.Directed by Ridley Scott, Legend is naturally beautiful to watch andthe make-up deserves a special mention for the hideous demon who'strying to slay the last unicorn. Tom Cruise (pre his meteoric rise tofame) plays the young forest boy who's destined to rescue the princesswell.Although I'm not sure whether Legend will find many new fans. It's toodark to appeal to the majority of children and too lightweight to beclassed as an adult's film.But for those of us with an affection for eighties films set in thedays of make-up and story telling over computer-effects and MichaelBay, should still sit back and smile at the classic adventure.Personally, I'll stick to the 'trimmed' version.Good, harmless, Saturday afternoon fun.
