A feast for the eyes, less so the brain, is Ridley Scott's dark fantasyfairy-tale. At several points in the film, the viewer is drawn to thewonderful make-up, set design and special effects, but rarely to theactors or even action, in the drama.The story uses the battle between the darkness and the light as obviousmetaphors for good and evil but for me was disjointed and haphazard inits wanton introduction of characters, scene progression and narrativedrive. It also doesn't help that there's little chemistry between thetwo star-crossed lovers in the leads or that they're separated for muchof the film. Modern eyes too will have reservations about the use oflightly-clad very young child actors as fairies and in particular thescene where the Tinkerbell-type Oona demands a full kiss from Cruise'sJack.Cruise is athletic enough in the lead but lacks presence and doesn'teven try to neutralise his jarring American accent. Mia Sara is betteras the young princess whose innocence Tim Curry's big bad,cloven-hoofed Lord of Darkness tries to corrupt, although in actualfact she probably looks more attractive in her dark-sidetransformation.The big pay-day for big-budget fantasy movies about magical"little-people" and epic quests in some picturesque never-land was somestill 20 years or so away, but I hesitate to call this particular moviea false dawn. Lacking even the slightest touch of humour, it's a rathermisshapen, unnecessarily bleak movie which summarily failed to reachthe inner-child in me.
