I remember when I saw for the first time this movie when I was 7 yearsold and I remember that The Devil scared me so much! But now, I saw itagain and I think it was an amazing idea to confront Good and Bad.Also, even when it continued with the same typical legends of magicalcreatures (like unicorns), they have new characters with new storiesthat made the plot different, but not unique, because the movie stillbeing the typical story of the princess and the charming warrior whowill safe her from the "bad guy". However, I think that this movie knewhow to create new things that couldn't be boring for audience and itcatched your attention every time. I really loved it!
