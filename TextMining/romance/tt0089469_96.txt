I must say I had mix feeling for this film when my sister told me aboutit. I wasn't sure what to really think. For the 80's I think they didreally good with the effects and some of the create in this film.Though the music is a bit distracting at some points in the movie. I'msure it was just the area of that age. The only thing I think lackedwas the characters Lilly, she was a bit irritating though I'm not sureif that's how she was meant to be. All so there is Tom whojust....interesting. My final word is cute. If you want to watch amovie with A LOT of fantasy, fairy's, and the good .vs. evil deal thenwatch this movie. Not great not horrible....O.k.
