I have loved this movie since I was a kid, and just recently got thenew double disc DVD. It is worth noting that this movie was the basisfor the critically acclaimed LEGEND OF ZELDA series...anyone familiarwith the Zelda series will see where the creators got thereinspiration...KUDOS all around! This movie sparked a generation of RPGplayers and a revolution in game play and strategy...it is completelyremarkable to me...to any Zelda fans out there check out thismovie...to LEGEND fans, check out ANY (except maybe the second one)Zelda game for Nintendo, you will not be disappointed.
