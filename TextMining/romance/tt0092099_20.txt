Top Gun is a good movie with a decent storyline and a good cast.It wasmy first time seeing the movie,I since its so well known I expected itto be a lot better,Tom Cruise did deliver a great performancehowever,but this movie is so cheesy,there's constant singing to feelgood songs and a cliché love story to it as well.I don't really likeVal Kilmer as an actor,mainly because he was the worst Batman ever,buthe delivered a pretty solid performance as Iceman.Students of a Us Fighting school compete against each other to be thebest in there class,while one of the students,Maverick (TomCruise),dates the teacher,Charlie (Kelly McGillis).
