This movie was released even before I was born. Tom was also quiteyoung in this movie. This movie was my favorite movie for a long time,it is still in my top 3 movies. In fact, this movie was responsible forTom cruise's stardom. I heard in that year 1986, a lot of guys wantedto be pilots just because of this movie.Top Gun is a story of pilot Pete Mitchell code name Maverick who isregarded dangerous pilot by the navy. Pete's father disappears in 1965Vietnam war. So, his father was considered reckless pilot by everyone.Maverick knows his father was a great pilot and he didn't screw up. Butstill there's a stigma attached to his family name. So, Maverick alwaystries to endeavor very hard when he flies.Top Gun is a film about emotion, passion and most importantly ego ofMaverick. Top Gun shows all the flavors of emotions. It showsdesperation of Maverick not to be second. Maverick has only one friendGoose. Goose is his family. Nobody likes Maverick, but Goose. Maverickdoesn't want to risk Goose's job, by doing some unnecessary stints inthe sky, but his desperation and ego to be better than others due whathappened to his father, never listens to him.Tom Cruise pulls off performance of his life in this movie. He is wellcomplimented by Kelly Mcgillis (Charley), Val Kilmer (Iceman) andAnthony Edwards (Goose). My fad for Top Gun is such that I had Maverickas my username on my email id for years. I've sen this flick more than50 times. I know every dialogue in this movie. This movie is a topnotch and as far as movie characters are concerned, Tom Cruise willalways be remembered as Maverick than any other characters he hasplayed.
