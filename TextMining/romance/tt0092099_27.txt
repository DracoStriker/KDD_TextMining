This movie was surprisingly good, and I thought that it was a reallygood movie about Top Gun. There really is a Top Gun, and it is the bestof the best, and this movie really showed the viewers that it was! Iliked how there was a little bit of romance included in the moviebecause it made it a little bit better. Tom Cruise was the HOTTEST inthis movie!!! Today he is still good looking for his age, but in thismovie, there are no words to describe him!! The movie was really good,but the one thing that made it amazing was him in it!! In this movie,to me, he is hotter than Shia LaBoeuf and Alex Pettyfer (they are stillreally hot)! Even though he made the movie even better, overall themovie its self I would give and 8 out of 10 with or without him in it.I would definitely recommend watching this, especially if you're a girlbecause you will not be able to keep your eyes off of Tom Cruise!
