If they were handing out awards for the most superficial,testosterone-driven movie of all time, i would have no trouble pickinga winner.The reviewer in the tele paper gave this two stars and called itvacuous, which made me think it would be fun to see, in the hopes itwould be fun-bad. But unfortunately, there was no fun to be had. Youcouldn't even laugh, the filmmakers took themselves so seriously. Theonly fun was remembering Hot Shots sending it up. The way Top Gun takesitself so seriously was really begging to be sent up.Disparaging boys club atmosphere is obnoxious to watch. Tom Cruiseshould feel ashamed when he looks back at that cocky smirk planted onhis face, that smirk that thought the adolescent politics of thesesilly guys would seem significant to viewers. If you're any older than a young adolescent boy yourself (though eventhis audience would only have been interested in it in the 80's,because its dated so badly), you won't enjoy this one bit.The aesthetic of these boys standing in the gym showers with theirshirts off, looking at each other and flirting with each other, as wellas the volleyball sequence where the camera pores over the muscles ofthe men jumping around, is the exact kind of "body is all" attitudeprevalent in the late 80's that was satirised in American Psycho. Ifyou want to get more value out of American Psycho, in fact, see thismovie first. You'll see that its an important thing being said in thatmovie - that this kind of worship of what looks good is unhealthy, anddangerous.
