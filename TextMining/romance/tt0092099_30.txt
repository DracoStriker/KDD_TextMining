Top Gun in dolby 6.1 sound is awesome.sounds better than when i saw itin the theater in '86. i thought they said this month cause an increasein people joining the Navy. Meg Ryan, Anthony Edwards,and Val Kilmerwere virtually nobodies when this came out as well.All turned out toobe prominent actors.Top Gun would not be as cool if it were made todaybecause of the computer graphics.it would turn out like Stealth.Thefootage of them flying was awesome,especially for 1986. This movie wasvery quotable as well.i remember everyone saying "I feel the need...theneed for speed!"and every guy i was friends with wanted a crotch-rocketbike after seeing Top Gun.
