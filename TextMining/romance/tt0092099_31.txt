When I first saw Top Gun my first reaction was "Hmm... that was missingsomething" it took my 5 seconds to realise that what this film ismissing is a plot. You may think I'm exaggerating here, but in myopinion this is one of the most overrated piles of garbage ever filmed.This film has one saving grace- the plane sequences. Honestly, buy aDVD player, a big screen TV, some really nice surround sound and thenskip all the scenes featuring any attempts at plot, because in allhonesty they don't try very hard. The acting is just bad. Wooden, andwithout any emotion whatsoever. There is absolutely no chemistry in theromance, and the plot is, in short, rubbish. Honestly, there is novirtue in it whatsoever.In short don't see this movie if you can any sense of acting or plotwriting.
