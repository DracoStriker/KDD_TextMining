Oh what an annoying movie! Regardless of all other considerations, Ijust could not get past the casting of Tom Cruise, who plays"Maverick", a hotshot fighter pilot who competes with other young pilotdudes in tough, daring aerial competition at an elite pilot school tosee who can be the best.Cruise swaggers and smirks his way through the plot, all decked out inheavy-duty flight suit and shades, his boyish face, short stature, andimmaturity in deportment making a mockery of what the film no doubt hadintended. I found his presence in this film rather nauseating. Insteadof portraying the "top gun", his character comes across more as the topjerk.In plot and dialogue, the film could be described as a popcorn flickfor kids, with lots of "action", as fighter jets blast off, roar andsoar, topsy-turvy like, showing off the daring-do of their annoyinglysmug aviators.The dialogue is just as sophomoric as the plot. In one dogfight scene,a couple of pilots converse. "Okay man, let's turn and burn ... We'regoing ballistic man, go get 'em ... it's time to buzz the tower" ...kinda like a video game ... man.Further, the film seems permanently time-bound in the 1980s, partlybecause of Tom Cruise, but also because the film's theme of jingoisticAmerican patriotism, while cogent then, is far less cogent now.The film does present some good visuals. The aerial shots areespecially good. And costumes and production design seem credible.Overall, this is just a typical Hollywood action movie around which alot of media buzz was made when it came out, but now seems dated and iseasily forgettable.
