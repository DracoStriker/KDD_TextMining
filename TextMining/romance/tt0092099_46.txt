After the release of Risky Business which became a box office hit,TomCruise became a superstar playing the role of Joel Goodsen.Then Top Gunwas released.This iconic film back in the 80's catapulted Cruise intobecoming a world-famous movie megastar.This 80's iconic film is about U.S.Navy fighter jet pilots studying ina top-notch Navy Aviation school commonly known as Top Gun.It centerson a cocky and highly-skilled pilot Lt.Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.Ittells his story on how his arrogance and confidence as well as hisunorthodox way of flying on air were questioned when his friend andco-pilot Goose was killed in an accident.This also resulted in himlosing the top honors to his rival Iceman.Added to that,we also get towitness Maverick's romantic interlude with his flight instructorCharlie.Finally,we also get to witness how Maverick regained hisconfidence back especially when the U.S. Navy fighter jet pilots wonthe battle against the so-called "visitors" (Russians)in the SouthChina Sea. No question that this was one iconic film back in the 80's.The greataerial scenes and footages were shot extremely well by the latedirector Tony Scott.The role of Maverick definitely suits Cruise'spersona which clearly defined his movie career as well as the futureroles for which he is extremely effective for many years to come.Thesupporting cast consists of many talented actors and actresses thatbecame future stars themselves such as Tim Robbins,Meg Ryan,AnthonyEdwards and Val Kilmer.Too bad that despite of the many great things the movie has had,itdefinitely has its low points.We definitely have a clichéd andpredictable script particularly Maverick's characterdevelopment.Also,the romance between Charlie and Maverick was far frombelievable and there was something lacking between them.That washighlighted especially as time went on considering Cruise and KellyMcGillis in real life were known to be different from each other.It wasevident that it does not hold up at present after it was releasedalmost 30 years ago.It was definitely an 80's film and it wouldprobably stay there for years to come.Definitely,Cruise can dosomething about it with Top Gun 2 and make it a great update with itsrelease in the future.
