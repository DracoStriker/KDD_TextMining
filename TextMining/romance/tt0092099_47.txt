Would hardly be accused of clichés, as it is more a source of them.This movie is the very definition of coolness, because what will adriver of a Ferrari or a sports car be left to say when comparing to anaval aviator sitting in an elegant piece of metal propelled by twoturbofan sources of pure power with 111kN of thrust each?Sweat, skin, volleyball and boys playing too gay? Well, it isdisputable, but if you're afraid of it, then you can't call yourself aman, can you?The story ignores the politics, the usual patriotic bullshit and ispleasantly satisfied with silent Stars and Stripes in the background.To the better, because there is only space for superlatives: who willbe the best of the best five percent. It's a way of life. Even on theground won't the main protagonist accept nothing else but the hardestof challenges and aims directly at the highest flying target, an oldervery feminine civil instructor.The competition and points were the movie's invention, but onlybecause, as the military adviser said, there would be no survivorclaiming the prize. Such are the amounts of testosterone in the air.To the amazing quality of the flying footage contributes the most thefact, that it is closer to reality than fiction. Filmed under patronageof U.S Navy and also sending the whole film crew to actually experienceall the "g's".I would never dare to admit that a movie I praise so much hasabsolutely no intellectual essence. It is modest enough to focus onwhat it is best at, and at that with passion. Same as Top gun pilots,the crew aimed at nothing but the best, because they knew, the list forsecond places hangs in the female toilet.
