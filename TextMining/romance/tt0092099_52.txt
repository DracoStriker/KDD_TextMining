Tom Cruise stars as a super-confident navy flier(Maverick) sent to theprestigious Top Gun program to become "the best of the best", alongwith friend Anthony Edwards(The Goose). Film details their ups anddowns, trials and tribulations learning to control their arrogance andgraduate from the program, with the help of their love interests(KellyMcGillis & Meg Ryan) High-octane adventure is pretty clichéd, butincredibly entertaining and energetic, with many rousing scenes, andspectacular aerial action and(at the time) state of the art aircraft.Romance with McGillis is not credible, but a small issue in such a funmovie, a guilty pleasure of sorts, though a blockbuster hit in 1986!
