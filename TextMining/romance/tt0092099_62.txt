An immensely entertaining, coming-of-age picture that casts Tom Cruiseas Lt. Pete Mitchell, call sign: Maverick, whose a cracker jack fighterpilot out to be the best of the best. He's thrilled when he gets sentwith his partner (the goofy, in a good way, Anthony Edwards) to thebest fire weapons school in the country, where he can compete for the'Top Gun' trophy. Maverick, naturally assuming he will win, (partly)creates tension between him and another pilot (Val Kilmer) and greatcharacter interactions result from this, with a nice touch ofadditional collisions of mixed personalities that take place betweenthe rest of the classmates and the main duo. As Maverick continues hislessons and classes, he woos a civilian instructor (the charming KellyMcGillis) who "teaches him a few things he can't learn in a classroom".A fresh, exciting, and very funny blockbuster hit that's sure to keepyou entertained through its complete running time. Highly recommended.Rating: Four out of Five Stars (Excellent).
