As a former Air Force cadet I'd like to point out how popular thismovie is among airmen. It's easily the most well known popular filmaround.That said, the USAF Aircraft in this film are not fighters, but lowlevel bombers. The were employed in the sort of role that is nowpredominantly carried out by the newer and more effective warthogs(A-10 tankbusters).I presume that the production crew were smart enough to realize thatfilming jet fighters is nigh on impossible regards the close upphotography involved, so they went with slower aircraft.For people that know military aircraft, the idea that F14 Tom Cats (lowlevel bombers) being handed tasked with the job of clearing the skiesof Migs (much faster more nimble dog fighting type fighters) iscompletely absurd. That said, this is a remarkably fun lightentertainment type movie that everyone, even those in the know, canenjoy.
