I love this film. It appeals to both men and women. It has plenty ofaction,up in the fighter planes. It could also be classed as a bit of a "chickflick" because of the romance story in entangled in it. But guys, don't beput off by that, it is still a cool film to watch!!!Tom Cruise pulls off the part of "Maverick" perfectly and his co-starKellyMcGillis ("Charlie") is a perfect supporting actress.This film has one of the best storylines i've even encountered and itrankshighly in my Top 50 films of all time. Every time i hear "Take My BreathAway" by Berlin (the theme song) I picture Tom Cruise on a motor bike,riding near the "Top Gun" base.I'd give this film 10 / 10 and i hardly ever rate films as high as that!!!
