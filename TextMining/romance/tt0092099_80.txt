Top Gun has proven itself to be one heck of a great film! When I finallygotround to watching it...13yrs after it was made, I loved it! The soundtrackwas fab! When I heard Danger Zone and Take my breath away, I just had amajor case of deja vu from when I was young. I haven't heard Danger Zonesince I was about 6/7!!! I was never a devout Tom Cruise fan, he wasalwaysa 'good' actor to me, but he was great in this! As was Anthony Edwards!andVal Kilmer! not to mention Meg Ryan, my favourite actress! So as u cantell,I really think highly of this movie. Good Stuff peoples!!
