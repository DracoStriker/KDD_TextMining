While this film is full of inaccuracies keep in mind the object of the filmmakers is to make money which they did with this film. As a former Navyenlisted type who was stationed at the Navy Fighter Weapons School i.e.Topgun I can say that if a movie was made about the actual goings on atTopgun it would be one very boring motion picture. It should be viewed asentertainment and not art. I do applaud the film makers who target marketedthis movie to the right audience.Virtually anyone in any job would view a film about their profession and beable to say "It's not really like that" but Hollywood is about entertainmentand the film Topgun had it's share of it.
