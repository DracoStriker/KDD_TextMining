The Princess Bride is one of the most brilliant romantic comedies of alltime. It is carefully constructed to fill so many film genres, including:romance, fairy tale, satire, comedy, and adventure. This film features anall star cast, who collaborated on every aspect of the film. The actorsbrought so much to their characters, creating well rounded personalitiesfrom even the most grotesque caricatures.The tale is based on a satirical novel by William Goldman. The film beginswith a grandfather reading the story to his sick grandson, and as Goldmansaid: the grandfather is only retelling the "good parts" of the supposedhistorical tale. If you haven't read the book, but love the movie, Iseriously recommend you sit down to read as soon as possible.This film is perfect for all people who enjoy a good laugh, and an evenbetter romance. I have been watching The Princess Bride since I was 6yearsold, and every time I watch it I learn something new about the story, thecharacters, or even the technical aspects involved. It is truly a storythatwill stand the test of time.
