Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is one of the best fairy tales ever inmy opinion. The movie takes place in a sick child's (played by FredSavage) home when his grandfather (played by Peter Falk) walks into hisbedroom to read a story called The Princess Bride to him. When thegrandfather is reading the story the movie is set in a farming areawith the two main characters Buttercup (played by Robin Wright) andWestley (played by Cary Elwes) until Westley leaves and Buttercup findsout that he is supposedly dead and says that she will never fall inlove again, until she gets engaged to a nasty prince named Humperdinck(played by Chris Sarandon) , then she gets kidnapped and held againsther will by 3 men named Vizzini (played by Wallace Shawn), InigoMontoya (played by Mandy Patinkin), and Fezzik (played by Andre theGiant) until Westley comes along and saves the princess under anotheridentity. And then Prince Humperdinck and his men try to save theprincess when she has already been saved but without even realizing andWestley is about to get killed by a little dwarf who calls himself thealbino (played by Mel Smith), along with Count Tyrone Rugen (played byChristopher Guest) who killed Inigo's father 20 years earlier alsoknown as the man with six fingers. then Westley is brought back to lifeby Miracle Max (played by an almost unrecognizable Billy Crystal) andhis wife (played by Carol Kane). Then after Westley is brought back tolife they have another mission on their hands crash the princess'swedding to the prince, and Inigo's mission is to kill the man whokilled his father by repeatedly saying "My name is Inigo Montoya, youkilled my father prepare to die." While watching this movie it remindedme of other movies like Forrest Gump a little bit because of how bothstories were told, Touch of Evil because of Prince Humperdink's missionto kill his so called future wife after the wedding, and of course TheAdventures of Robin Hood because of whole entire story-line to bothfilms. The way Rob Reiner directs this movie is not only similar to theway that Michael Curtiz directed the 1938 movie version of Robin Hood,but also it brings William Goldman's book of the same name to life onthe big screen. A great movie for a whole family to watch.
