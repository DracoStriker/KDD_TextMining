By virtue of the "under 29" female vote, "Princess Bride" is somewhatoverrated on the IMDB, but still is a good, fun movie.  I rate it "8" of10.The recently-released special edition DVD is the one to view. The colors arenicely saturated in most scenes, it has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, and thereare lots of extras, including one of the better "making of" specials. One ofmy favorite actors is Mandy Patinkin, and here he is great as the Spanishswordsman seeking revenge for his father's death at the hand of thesix-fingered swordsman played by Christopher Guess. This was Robin Wright'sfirst film, as a 19-year-old, playing Buttercup. Cary Elwes is also perfectas her love interest. Andre the Giant, who died in 1993 at age 45, was sofitting in his role as the giant. Overall a fine cast and a fine,entertaining, funny film. A "comic fairy tale in a strange land" as read toa child.The moral of the film, "True love conquers everything."  How could anyonedislike such a story??
