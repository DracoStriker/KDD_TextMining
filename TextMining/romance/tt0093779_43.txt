I love this film! It will always be one of my favourite films. Thisfilm has been the center of many nights in, sleepovers and just onionthe background while cleaning the house :) It has everything you couldever want from an adventure film: sword fight, romance, pirates,villains, heroes etc. (as well as being seriously funny!) I would alsohighly recommend the book (although would suggest watching the filmfirst to get some context)
