The Princess Bride is a wonderful family film about a maiden namedButtercupand her "farmboy" Wesley. When Wesley goes away to seek his fortune, he isreported to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Hearing this reallygetsButtercup down, and it only gets worse when Prince Humperdink chooses hertobe his bride.( Hence the title) To make a long story short and not giveawaythe ending, Buttercup's kidnapped for suspicious reasons and rescued bysomeone familiar. She's in love and nothing can stop true love! A coupleofdeaths, a would be wedding, revenge fulfilled, and a couple reunited endthis gala of a film. But this doesn't even sum it up, I promise! I lovethisfilm because it does not take itself too seriously and flows well acrossthescreen. The main characters and their supporting cast are quirky andmemorable. You will be repeating classic lines like, "My name is InigoMontoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!" over and over again.Throughthe adventures of Wesley and Buttercup you feel drawn to the charactersandfall in love with their ability to amuse you.
