This will hit a particularly sweet spot, if you only let it. It willfind the child in you, and tell you a story of medieval adventure andtrue love. There are going to be like in the storybooks, expertswordsmen, six-fingered knaves, giant rats, fiery swamps, the DreddPirate Roberts. The maiden will need last-minute rescuing from thecruel king.But as the kid in you becomes prepared to be engrossed, the narratorwill show you that it is all goofy make-believe for the kick of makingit all up as we go. It will not be epic with grand battles and pureevil because you are not actually a child, but sketch only thepicaresque outline of things, trusting you to imagine the rest.So this is nice. Both the storybook for kids, and good-naturedacknowledgment of its fiction.We can be both in and out of the film, poking fun at knowing it is fun.
