"This is Spinal Tap", "When Harry Met Sally" and "The Princess Bride"give director Rob Reiner a trio of timeless classics. "Princess Bride"takes the classic boy-meets-girl setup and adds "Wizard of Oz"-levellines such as "life is pain, anyone who tells you otherwise is tryingto sell you something" and "you keep saying that word (inconceivable)-Ido not think it means what you think it means." He also adds a flawlesscast including the under-appreciated Mandy Patinkin, a shockinglymenacing portrayal from the normally silly Christopher Guest and thepreviously unusable Andre' the Giant who is somehow made to deliver anunderstandable and winning performance. By the turns the movie isfunny, frightening, dramatic, comedic, suspenseful and whimsical. Theframing device with Peter Falk and Fred Savage allows Reiner to stepout when things become too intense and makes this watchable even forthe younger set. In short, add this to your must see list especially ifyou have children.
