A dazzling tale of a princess, a peasant, swordplay, revenge, good and evil- so why does William Goldman feel it needs a frame story?  The frame storyhe uses in the novel is intrusive and, to be frank, pungently offensive;here he uses the more conventional device of having an old man tell thestory to his grandson, which may be hackneyed but is nonetheless a distinctimprovement.  At any rate it helps me understand why the frame story isthere.  It's Goldman's way of announcing that he has a real corker of astory to tell - a story so superb that it's simply impossible not to beenthralled by it.  Goldman is daring us to find fault.  `My main story is SOGOOD,' he says, `that I can afford to encumber it with this irritatingframing device, and it will STILL make your heart pound.  I can dare you tobe indifferent and you'll STILL care.'And he's right.So are you ready for it?  Can you handle what Goldman is presenting as theUltimate Story?  Then proceed - and I'd advise you to proceed with the film,rather than the book.
