I love this movie!  It's sweet, but with satirical humor. The dialogue isgreat and the adventure scenes are fun.  Rob Reiner shows an excellenttouchonce again with comedy and a childlike point of view.  It manages to bewhimsical romantic while laughing at the conventions of the fairy talegenre.I would recommend it to just about anyone. I've seen it several times, andI'm always happy to see it again whenever I have a friend who hasn't seenityet. I haven't watched it with any kids, but I think it has lots for themtoo.There are wonderful quotes throughout.  I think Mandy Patinkin absolutelysteals the scenes he is in as the Spaniard Inigo Montoya, bent on avenginghis father's death.I gave it 8 out of 10 mainly because it feels very light, but I may gobackand change to 9 thinking of how happy this movie makes me and it'srewatchability.
