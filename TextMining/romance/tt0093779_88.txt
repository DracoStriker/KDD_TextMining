On my own, I would never have watched this movie based on the titlealone. But it's in the IMDb 'Top 250', so as I manage my viewing to gothrough that list, this one came up in it's proper turn. I'd have tosay this one was more than a surprise. It was fairly entertaining and Idon't mind saying it had the very best sword fight I've ever seen inany movie, which is saying something because I've seen Errol Flynn,Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks in action, and I don't think any ofthem could have held their own with either Dread Pirate Roberts/FarmBoy Westley (Cary Elwes) or Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin). Now therecould have been some special effects involved there, but if so, itwasn't transparent. Those two put on quite a show.The story also had a few pretty cool concepts like the shrieking eelsand the Cliffs of Insanity. The Fire Swamp and the Lightning Sand werekind of original too. The convoluted turn of phrase that old Vizzini(Wallace Shawn) engaged in trying to outwit the Dread Pirate was prettyamusing, and if you try to keep up with it you'll be hopelessly lost,so best not even to try. It was also neat to see Andre the Giant in thefilm, one of the wrestling world's all time favorites. Interesting, butwhen he spoke he sounded kind of normal, unlike his in-character TVinterviews where he had a much more guttural and heavily accentedvoice.With all that going on, it's easy to forget that the Princess Bridetale is a story within a story, as a grandfather (Peter Falk) attemptsto carry on a long family tradition of reading a favorite book to hisgrandson (Fred Savage). It doesn't sound very favorable at the outsetwith the romance and the 'eeeuw' kissing, but the kid warms up to thestory when it sounds like there will be some action and adventure. If Ihad to come up with a minor nit-pick, it seemed like the picture got abit more slapstick in the final third of the movie. Otherwise the humorwas well placed and I thought it made for fine family fare.
