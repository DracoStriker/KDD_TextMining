Howards End is a truly brilliant film, it is absolutely perfect in itsexecution. The screenplay is perfect as is the story. The performancesare flawless, Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anthony Hopkinsare just perfect in the leads. They are just great. James Ivory is oneof cinema's best directors, and this is his best film and directorialjob, he is just brilliant. Flawless direction by a perfect director.The art direction, cinematography, costume design, and musical scoreare all also very good, beautiful, and pretty much flawless. HowardsEnd is just a great movie that everybody should see before they die. Itis human, it ends how it should, not how we want it too which is one ofmovies biggest problems as of now.
