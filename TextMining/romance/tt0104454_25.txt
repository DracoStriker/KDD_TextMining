In so many ways, the best of the superlative Merchant-Ivory series and oneof the greatest movies of the last ten years.Like the other movies on that list (Fargo, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction,Saving Private Ryan), it features innovative direction, nuanced acting,stunning cinematography, and gripping storytelling. Yet it is completelyunlike the others. A costumed parable like Spielberg's two entries -- butlacking the obvious good vs. evil dynamic. The dialogue dazzles, but not byfalling back on the shock value and pop culture riffing of Pulp Fiction. AndFargo... well, it's impossible to compare any movie toFargo.Perhaps too subtle for its own good (judging by its surprisingly low ratingon this database), Howards End tells a story that succeeds on multiplelevels - as indictment of the Edwardian class system; as an interwoven taleof complex people with truly simple motivations; and as how-to video for upand coming actors. Witness the way Anthony Hopkins slowly seduces EmmaThompson, or the gentle scenes between Thompson and a bravely naive VanessaRedgrave, or the movie's brief flashes of visceral passion unleashed byHelena Bonham-Carter, or... etc., etc., etc.Indeed, what finally sets Howards End apart from the other greats of theNineties are the numerous strong female characters. In an era of "no partsfor women," this features more memorable women (besides those mentioned,special notice should go to Nicola Duffett's tragic prostitute) than in allof the decade's more garishly feminist indie movies puttogether.
