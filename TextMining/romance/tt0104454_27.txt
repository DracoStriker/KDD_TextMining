I watched this movie, and then read Roger Ebert's review of it. And Icompletely agree with one thing he said:Ultimately, this film allows us to take a peek into the lives ofcertain people and watch events unfold and *happen* to them. We arewatching something *happen*, not simply a movie or screenplayunfolding.There are many other great things about this film as well, but thefeeling stated above is what many (if not most) movies fail to achieve,and with that fail to achieve "greatness".Beyond the great acting and directorial execution we are treated to,the audience also gets a chance with this film to explore class,values, and the interplay of characters that differ in many ways, butcome together via certain events.There isn't much more to say. The fact is that if you want a characterdrama, with this film you have it. If you want an exploration of what's"right", this film explores that. Income inequality? That as well. Andof course, the ultimate discussion here is societal privilege.It is even more amazing that the novel that the film is based on waswritten in 1910.
