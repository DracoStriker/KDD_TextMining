I figure that a lot of people didn't see Howard's End for fear that it wouldbe a long, drawn-out romance. At least, that is what I was expecting (havingnever read the novel it was based on, and not knowing much about the movie).Well, I am pleased to say I am wrong - it's not a romance, and it justhappens to be a superb film.Howard's End took its time to develop, but it was consistent, and thecharacters were all interesting and well-defined. The script seemed to bequite sharp, and featured lots of interesting dialogue and a very strongstory throughout. The acting was also excellent. Emma Thompson won awell-deserved Oscar for her role here - but just about every actor here dida good job with their roles, especially Helena Bonham Carter. And the sets!This movie was, put simply, a treat for the eyes. Every scene in the moviewas rich and interesting. The different buildings, costumes, plant life,everything about it was beautiful to look at. It is one of the most visuallyimpressive movies I've ever seen.In short, I really enjoyed Howard's End - far more than I thought it would.The characters were all real, three-dimension people (no matter how minor).The storyline was quite deep and interesting. It was, quite simply, ariveting movie... from the opening scene to the final shot. Would I watch itagain? Absolutely. It's a great film, and the best to be released in 1992.
