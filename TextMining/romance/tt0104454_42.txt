"Howard's End" is more than a period piece--it's a film set in 1910 with astory of today, yesterday, and of any other year you choose.  It is afinelyspun tale about deception, forgiveness, hypocrisy and loss.Emma Thompson, in the central role, plays a strong, caring woman.  Yet oneof her best scenes unveils the crumbling of that fortitude, in which shesobs in front of a mirror.  Anthony Hopkins, a wholly fascinating actor,isnot necessarily a sympathetic or even nice character.  Yet we feel sorryforhim all the same when the world around him blackens.Other lead roles are right on target (watch for signs of Ophelia in Helen)and add to the genuine flavor.
