I agree, this is an excellent movie done with good taste; beautifulboth visually and in content. It is refreshing to find such a fineexample of its genre without the contamination of vulgar Hollywoodviolence, action and sex. It satisfies visually, mentally and sensuallyas it unfolds the pages of this poignant story. Anthony Hopkins bringsthe finishing touch to any role in his easy-going natural acting stylethat makes one feel like they are eavesdropping on the private lives ofthe genteel class as they carry on with their routines of their day andhave to handle not only their problems but also shoulder the problemsof the lower class they are inextricably bound to by their commonhumanity.
