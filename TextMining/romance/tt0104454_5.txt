Howard's End is not an easy movie to sit through if you do not typicallywatch period films.  The language and euphemisms are very old fashioned(1910).  But if you really sit back and watch the story unfold you willbecome engrossed. The crafting of the story by Merchant Ivory isimpeccable.They tell the story so visually that you may not notice how physicallyalikeMargaret Schlegel is to Ruth Wilcox in carriage and deportment, but thelight-bulb goes off when the housekeeper of Howard's End mistakes Margaretfor Ruth. The story itself is so quiet and brilliant that you don'trealizesomething so very profound has happened until the credits roll. Everyperformance is amazing, but Emma Thompson (she won the Best Actress Oscar)and Vanessa Redgrave stand out. Their scenes together are so full ofnuancesthat it's hard to take it all in during a first viewing.
