This film benefits initially from the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and EmmaThompson as eventual husband and wife. Each an accomplished performer, theircharacters are at the centre of the world of the Wilcox's and Howards End,the family home. Excellent performances from the rest of the cast withexceptional parts of the plot. My favourite being when Thompson's characterrealises the starving woman at a function they are holding used to beHopkin's character's lover. Strong cast, strong plot, strong acting from allbut credit must go surely to  Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins. A magic isthere that they re-created for their performance in 'The Remains of theDay'.
