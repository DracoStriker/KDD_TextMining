Howards End.It is truly one of the most beautiful films evermade.Wonderfully directed and superb acting by all!Hopkins and Emma Thompsonare at their best here.We are given a look into a world divided by twoclasses.I enjoyed this social tale and it's colorful english scenery!Thisfilm is the perfect example of why I love the movies.NOt only our wepriviledge to witness sir Anthony Hopkins in undoubtly one of his finestperformances,we also feel the heavy weight of a promise,that thecharacter,Leonard Bass,has on his shoulders.If you have not seen thismovie,you should.Maybe,you too,will ask yourself,"Why can't they make moremovies like this??"
