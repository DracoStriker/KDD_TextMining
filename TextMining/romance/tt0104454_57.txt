Oh how I did enjoy this movie!  Each Merchant-Ivory film I see, I love theothers more and more.  Howard's End developed each character beautifully tothe point of where each served there purpose perfectly.  The acting wasincredible on all parts and most of all this film brought another greatnovel by E.M. Forester alive for me.  As I did with "Room with a View" Imust go purchase the novel now!  What a fantastic story indeed!
