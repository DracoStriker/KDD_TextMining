Producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory return, again, to thesource of their greatest commercial triumph (E.M. Forster, author of'Room With A View'), but this time have chosen a novel which doesn'tlend itself well to screen adaptation. The customary virtues of otherMerchant-Ivory productions are all here: the handsome period setting; agraceful and witty screenplay; tasteful direction and so forth, butevery grace note is undermined by Forster's awkward scenario andsometimes labored plotting, often requiring key characters to disappearfor long stretches of screen time. In the end Ivory tacitly admitsdefeat by using portentous slow motion effects to make a dramaticpoint, a technique best left to Hollywood hacks with music videotraining. Saving graces include appearances by a luminous VanessaRedgrave, and Anthony Hopkins showing his true range after being laudedfor his one-note performance in 'Silence of the Lambs'.
