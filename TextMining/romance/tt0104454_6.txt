For those who want to watch an intelligent, lovely-to-look-atmotionpicture, it doesn't get much better than this. The film tells thestoryof two sisters, of limited but respectable means, who collide withtheworld of the very rich in Edwardian England.  One sister benefits fromtheacquaintance with the wealthy Wilcoxes.  The other is all but destroyedbyit.  Along the way, there are charming scenes of tea parties and musicclasses, elegant costumes, fantastic settings, andengaging conversations.  There is also a sad, secondary storyline of apoorclerk and his wife who, unfortunately, slip into even moreabysmalcircumstances through no fault of their own.  The ending is tingedwithdespair, even as it offers some hope for both of the sisters'futures.The film should be commended as well for the fine performances ofEmmaThompson, Anthony Hopkins, Helena Bonham-Carter and others.  Anydiscriminating film enthusiast will not want to miss thismovie.
