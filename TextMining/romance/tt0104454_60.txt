This film is about two upper class families entangled through a coupleof lower social class.This period drama has amazing production. Every scene is carefullycomposed, and every set is lavishly decorated. Coupled with the stellarcast, I can't believe that it only cost $8 million to produce. The plotis interesting as it critiques the hypocrisy of the upper class back inthe Edwardian times. It raises a question, whether one would want to bethe affluent Mr Wilcox who has questionable morals, or the poor Mr Bastwith admirable morals. I also like the striking contrast of charactersbetween Helen, Meg & Mrs Wilcox. Acting is great by the stellar cast.Though the film is very long, it did not bore me once.
