If all movies (yes, movies, a perfectly respetable word) were as goodas this one, I would spend all my time watching movies and get nothingwhatsoever done. I've seen Howards End probably closing in on 10 timesnow. It is one of the only cases I can think of where the movie isbetter than the book on which it is based. These movie characters staywith you, and have a life of their own, like great characters infiction. After reading the thread of comments about this movie, all Ican say is that there is no accounting for the taste of some people.How anyone could think that Howards End is boring and without merit isbeyond me. All I can say is that I hope I never meet those people whothink it such.
