Being a man who appreciates beauty and great visual movies, I havechecked out all the Merchant-Ivory films. I found this to be theirprettiest, just stunning in its beauty. Story-wise, I preferred "The Remains Of The Day," but this was okay. Itjust didn't have the appealing characters "Remains" had and it was alittle too soap opera for my tastes but the visuals made up for that,...and the story, to be fair, was solid and involving.It also had Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, and those two make agreat pair. I would never get tired of watching either of these greatactors, especially when they are together.If you like period pieces - this is 1910 Edwardian England - along withfabulous sets and scenery, a solid cast, and an involving story, you'lllike this. If you are a fan of melodramas then you'll really, reallylike this!
