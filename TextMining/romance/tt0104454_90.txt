I gave it 1 out of ten. One of the most flat and non-imaginative moviesI'veever seen -- the plot is weak, the characters are flat and definitely notfrom even something relatively close to real life, the twists are made outof thin air. It's extremely hard for me to understand how it gained 7.4rating frankly.
