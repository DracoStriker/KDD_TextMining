possibly my favourite film of all time, this truly does live up to itstitle and presents in my mind one of the truest romances there can everbe, fictional or otherwise. superb acting, superb directing, superb scriptwriting and possibly thebest cameo ever by Samuel L Jackson to cap it off. i don't think thatthis film could be any improved in anyway whatsoever, even if it had anunlimited stream of cash and all actor/actress available. just a truly spectacular piece of film making and the reason why i lovemovies so much...i have a rule that no one can leave my house unlessthey watch this film beforehand, it is truly one of the greats andanyone who doesn't watch it is severely missing out
