True Romance is my favorite movie of all time.  The reason I love it so muchis that you might think you know what is going to happen, but you are wrong! You don't know what is going to happen next.  You're watching this movieand you're in a groove, when suddenly the movie takes a left hand turn andyou are heading in the completely opposite direction.The acting and directing is fantastic.  This is a violent, violent movie,but the violence works.  Patricia Arquette is wonderful as Alabama.  I am awoman and I don't really want to see another woman's cleavage, but in thismovie, the cleavage works.  In other words, the sex and violence in thismovie don't feel gratuitous, but rather a part of a greatplot.Christian Slater is such a great actor.  This is a star-studded cast,including Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman and more. Most people watch this movie and don't even recognize GaryOldman.I've seen this movie about 20 times now and, although I'm no longersurprised by the plot twists, I am still fascinated by the cast, the music,the direction.  I like this movie quite a bit more than Pulp Fiction.  Thisfilm was written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott and cameout a few years before Pulp Fiction.  If you are really interested in thisfilm be sure and get the DVD with all of the comments from the cast,producers, director, writer, etc.
