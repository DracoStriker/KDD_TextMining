'True Romance' is instantly recognisable as a Tarantino film, althoughit is directed by Tony Scott, with the writing credits attributed toTarantino. The cast is promising, and the opening credits intrigued mewith the promise of performances by Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt,Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and a host of other acclaimedactors. The lead roles are played by Christian Slater and PatriciaArquette, as a couple of cinema-goers who stumble upon one another andinadvertently fall in love. The plot soon acquires an action- thrillernarrative as drugs, pimps and gangsters infringe on the couple's peace.Arquette handles her role well and plays some scenes excellently, butI'm not so sure about the casting of Slater: I think there wassubstantially better talent on-hand for 'True Romance', and I have tosay that I didn't enjoy Slater's performance very much at all. One ofthe most talked about scenes of Scott's film seems to be the onebetween Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, perhaps the two mostdistinguished actors in the film (at this point). The scene iscertainly decent, but doesn't really seem integral to the wider story.Many of the other scenes take a very Tarantino-esque approach: heatedarguments are made between characters, followed by a bloody shootout. Ithink that this is milked somewhat in 'True Romance', and I thoughtthat a lot more restraint could have been shown. The whole film seemslike a proto-'Pulp Fiction', but with less interesting characters anddevelopments. I also noticed that by the 45-minute mark, everycharacter in Scott's film annoyed me for a different reason. The wholeproduction is as inexplicable as 'No Country for Old Men' and asdesperate as '25th Hour', but lacks the strong characters andnarratives that defined both of these superior drugs-themed films.
