The plot is good, although it sometimes moves a little too close toothe edge of believability. The characters are fun and very Tarantino,the cast does a great job fleshing them out even when they only have asmall part. I also want to note the catchy and memorable score by Hans Zimmer thatlends the film an upbeat and airy tone that fits the mentality of thetwo main characters and also sometimes forms a perfect contrast againstthe darker, more violent and bloody scenes. This early screenplay byTarantino contains many of the fun "tarantinoizms" that make his moviesso much fun!Overall Tony Scott has done a good job adapting the screenplay.One of my main problems with the film is that the final shootout Is abit anticlimactic. The characters simply stand in a room and shoot ateach other. This scene could have used some more suspense and style.Also the relationship between Clarence and Alabama was sometimes, likethe plot of this movie, too close too the edge of believability.*Spoilers* I also want to make special note of the scene where Alabamais almost beaten to death by one of the mafiosi. It was very difficultto watch not only because of the emotionally intense and graphicviolence, but also because this scene was excruciatingly long, withlittle "funny" scenes in between of Clarence driving to the hotel withnot a care in the world, unknowing of the horror that is taking placein the hotel room.
