This movie is quite good. It appears in neo-noir lists, which is why Igot a copy and watched it. I didn't know that Q. Tarentino wrote it. Hedid a nice job, but see below. The noir element is light in this movie.It's more of a violent screwball comedy.I'm the last one to have seen it, no doubt.It's a mild or partial parody mixed with a romance thriller. It's aseriocomic picture with some exaggerated scenes appearing quitefrequently to the point where they may become comic despite beingviolent. The cast includes many recognizable name players who are givena chance to ham it up a bit. Gary Oldman does an impression of a blackman with those Jamaican hair braids whose name escapes me. All heneeded was the accent. Dennis Hopper gets a chance to deliver anextended insult to Chris Walken playing a Sicilian mobster. PatriciaArquette plays it straight as a smart, street-wise and courageousblonde. She's great. Christian Slater is a man with two sides, and oneis surprising. Brad Pitt gets to play a drugged out guy; he seems oftento play such weird characters. James Gandolfini is a hit man who getsto deliver a monologue about killing.The dialog is quite effective but not, I would say, always squarelyhitting the comic mark. It doesn't have the twistiness of the reallygood comic lines. It's nowhere near Billy Wilder. Instead it achievessome effect by a kind of rambling, more discursive and politicallyincorrect or exaggerated method that aims to surprise and shock bysaying things we do not ordinarily expect a character to say.Characters may say things that are essentially out of character. Themost memorable scenes involve a lot of violence. You could say that theexpectation and threat of violence is what keeps some of these scenesfrom bogging down. Tarentino delivers tension through this violentedge.
