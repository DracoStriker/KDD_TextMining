No doubt, perhaps there could've been more fluidity in this, but itdoesn't matter. The two leads are exquisite, both injecting theircharacters with a lot of charm and humanity despite all of the thingsthey are embarking on and doing. That's a real achievement. It's maybenot as great of a film as it clearly aimed to be, sort of similar toother classics of older eras or even classics of its own era, but it'sremember rather well, and that's impressive. I really saw it because ofPatricia Arquette, and she shines here surely. I think it's a film thatwill be very hard to dislike for most people, and it's something thatwill be so much fun to most.
