The atmosphere in this movie is splitted. At the beginning in Detroit,things start pretty calm and pictures and scenery create a compellingatmosphere. Later in the plot in LA things start to happen pretty fastbit by bit and the scenes appear scrappy. only when it comes to theshowdown, the movie gains back its good created atmosphere.short appearance but very good acting by Christopher Walken. also JamesGandolfini and Brad Pitt make short but good performances. Dialoguesseems realistic and convincing to me. The end is a little bitconstrained happy for my taste and the music gives the romance of themovie a harmonic but at the same time surreal touch, but i find itincongruous.All in all the movie provides a solid story with some palatablesurprises but also some lacks in the well established atmosphere fromthe beginning. Not good enough to be in the list of my favourite moviesor to play in the league of cultmovies but definitely worth a goodmovie evening.
