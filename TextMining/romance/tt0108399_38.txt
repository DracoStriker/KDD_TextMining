This film is about a guy who falls in love with a hooker and marriesher. What a lovely story, taking this poor miscreant off the streetsand showing her that he is willing to take care of her. Of course, youknow everything is going to go without a hitch. Not really, from acrazed white pimp who thinks he is black to mob types to undercovercops this couple is going to have a really hard time getting to thehoneymoon. The film has lots of violence, some sex, and inexplicablyBronson Pinchot who at the time was still most known as the lovableBalki from the television show "Perfect Strangers". Well here he playsa guy who gets caught by the cops with some white powder on his noseand it is not from a doughnut. The film's best sequence to me thoughwas the Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper one. Great scene, I lovehow Hopper's character basically realizes what is going to happen tohim so he does his best to insult Walken's character as a parting shot.Just wish both of them were in the movie a bit more, especially Walkenwho disappears from the film after this scene. I could have donewithout the Elvis ghost scenes, but aside from that I have a ratherpositive image of this movie despite the fact it is not something Itypically care for.
