I find that True Romance intersects with Terence Malick's Badlands in afewinteresting ways - perhaps QT is responding to Malick's classic by copyingsome stylistic devices.  Both films are capable of being lumped togetherunder the "road movie" subgenre of the crime film, so it's not tooinconceivable that Tarantino and Scott had Bad Lands on their minds whilemaking Romance.  Both films open and close with a voice-over by the femalelead and in both voice-overs, the character establishes herself initiallyasa rather inexperienced person, one who didn't expect to be involved in theaction to follow.  In Badlands, Kit murders Holly's father and thus beginstheir crime spree; in Romance, Clarence kills Drexel, the closest thing toafather-figure that Alabama has and likewise makes it necessary for thecouple to run from the law.  Also, the two films' incidental music is toosimilar to be a coincidence.
