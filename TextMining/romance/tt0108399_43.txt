They don't come much more entertaining and enthralling than this early'90's classic. Even though this is very much a Tony Scott film (and oneof his very best for that matter), ample credit must be paid to our manTarantino for putting this wonderful, crazy ride together. His dialoguepulsates with wit and verve, his characters radiate with charisma andmanic energy, and the whole film is a colorful, rich, endlesslyengaging romp. And we can't forget the dynamite cast, who are all atthe top of their game here. The Walken/Hopper Sicilian scene is trulyone for the ages, and the chemistry between Slater and Arquette isfiery.It's just a shame that the film wasn't more appreciated and lauded uponits initial release but it has rightfully found a cult following in theyears to come.
