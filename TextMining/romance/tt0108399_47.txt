This 5-star movie rated 7.9 on the IMDb scale. I never viewed thismovie until 2009 because I was stuck in Saudi Arabia in 93. I neverheard of it until I browsed Tony Scott and saw its rating. In summary,this movie was filmed ahead of it time. It's a 'wild' and 'free' lovingmovie and a part of pop culture. I fell in love with Clarence andAlabama and their magical attraction to each other. Very few movieswith a cast of pop stars turns into a masterpiece. This movie is TonyScott's 'magnum opus' or greatest work. I purchased a director's cutcopy. Tarantino wrote a pop culture classic. Scott directed a lovestory like no other. Slater, a comic book salesman and movieenthusiast, played the part of a delusional 'King of pop'. Arquette,loyal hot pants, to pimp and then husband was alluring. Hopper wasHopper, a trustworthy father who passed his freedom loving genes to hisson Clarence. Kilmer played Elvis in voice as the 'King of Pop' to amentor driven Clarence. Walken has never been better as he played aSicilian mobster after his cocaine deal went bad. Oldman played Oldmanas the pimp, drug pusher, pirate of Detroit. Pitt played a minor partmade major by his drug habits. Without major credit, James Gandolfiniplayed Tony Saprano in the making. I'm sure his unbelievableperformance led to him being selected for the HBO series "TheSopranos." In a nutshell, this sick movie was fantastic and alluring.
