**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**With Tarantino writing the script for this movie, it was sure to beentertaining.  But to me, the direction of Tony Scott just didn't fit.  The'fact' scene between Walken and Hopper, was very well done, but I didn'tappreciate the racial slurs used.  I know, I know...I should be sort of usedto this when Tarantino is involved...but it still didn't go over well.  Ifeel the use of the 'N' word was unnecessary in that case.  Nevertheless,seeing Walken and Hopper on screen together was awesome.  The violence wasjust overkill, the scene with Arquette and Gandolfini was just too much. And what was with the 'True Romance' of the movie?  What romance?  A callgirl is called to give Slater a good time, and they end up falling in love? How are we supposed to believe that this is a 'true romance'??  Because theykiss every chance they get?  They've been together for like 3 days or such! Puppy love, anyone?  C'mon.  They could've given it a better title.  Thismovie has so much potential to be on the level of a Reservoir Dogs, youknow, great.  But it falls short.** out of **** stars
