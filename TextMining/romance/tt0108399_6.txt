Cynical, seen-it-all-before smart ass that I am, I can't but help love 'TrueRomance'! On paper it looks like a sure fire recipe for disaster. Atypically hip pop-culture saturated Quentin Tarantino script directed byschlockmeister Tony Scott, the man responsible for rancidSimpson/Bruckheimer "blockbusters" like 'Top Gun' and 'Days Of Thunder'. Butsome how it really works! The movie is especially helped by a dynamite cast,one of the most impressive in many years. Possibly only Julian Schnabel'sunderrated biopic 'Basquiat' can rival its mixture of star power and cultfaves. Slater, Arquette, Walken, Hopper, Oldman, Kilmer, Penn, Sizemore,Jackson, Rapaport, Gandolfini, Argo, Corrigan, etc.etc. These are many ofthe finest actors working today. Add them to an electric story of love onthe run, jam packed with amusing, highly quotable dialogue and plenty ofaction and laughs, and you have yourself a genuinely entertaining update ofa classic 70s drive-in movie. 'True Romance' is a wild ride not to bemissed!
