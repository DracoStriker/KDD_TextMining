Visionary director Tony Scott brings an early Quentin Tarantino scriptto life. The cast is beyond amazing (Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper,Gary Oldman Samuel L Jackson & more) especially the leads that play anamazingly lovable couple, the dialogue is witty and smart (some ofTarantino's best), the violence is bloody and realistic, plus plenty ofdark humor. What else could you want in a movie? Side note: apparentlyBrad Pitt's stoner character was the inspiration for "PineappleExpress".
