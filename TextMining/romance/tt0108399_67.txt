Watched this for the first time last night and it's one of the greatestmovies I've ever seen. You can tell it was written by Quentin Tarantinoand if you didn't know otherwise you'd think it was directed by himtoo. Every character is brilliantly portrayed. Even supporting actorsthat only have minimal screen time such as Christopher Walken, DennisHopper and Gary Oldman give very memorable performances and have someof the best scenes in the film. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquetteboth give Oscar worthy performances in their lead roles. True Romancehas the perfect mix of great dialogue, romance, action and strongviolence. Without spoiling the ending, what I really wanted from thisfilm was a satisfying ending and it delivered %100. Some scenes willhave you laughing out loud while others while have you on the edge ofyour seat with tension. I don't really see the point of casting BradPitt in such a small and unimportant role when any actor could offilled the role but this in no way hinders the enjoyment of the film.The film also has a great soundtrack which I listened to straight afterI'd finished and has a good mix of different genre's. True Romance isan astoundingly exciting film and would probably be best enjoyed byfans of Tarantino but I would recommend this film to anyone. Give thisfilm a watch ASAP.
