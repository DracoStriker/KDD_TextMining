True Romance (1993)- 4.5/5 Possible Spoilers.One more impressive outing from the writing of Quentin Tarantino and along list of credible actors. The dialog and performances really makethe film entertaining and engaging. The storyline involves movie geekClarence Worley (Slater) who meets a hooker named Alabama (Arquette)and falls in love with her. Clarence has trouble with her pimp, Drexl(Oldman), but ends up killing him after a fight. Instead of picking upAlabama's belongings at Drexl's apartment, Clarence picks up abriefcase filled with half a million dollars worth of cocaine byaccident. The two plan to travel to Los Angeles to sell all of it andmove away with the money, but a group of mobsters and the LAPD are bothinformed on the situation and try to reclaim it. Slater, who I don'tparticularly care for, does his best here and I was not let down withhis performance. Tarantino's script is just great - using far more talkrather than violence to make the movie work. The cameos and supportingcast do very well in their roles, most notably Walken and Pitt. TonyScott's direction is pretty impressive, as he provides us with a filmfar superior than the list of mediocre flicks the director has made.Maybe not one of the top films from the year, but definitely enjoyableand the best movie by Tony Scott.Cast: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, MichaelRapaport, Gary Oldman, Bronson Pinchot, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken,Saul Rubinek, Val Kilmer, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, James Gandolfini,Samuel L.
