Quite simply, this is one of the most despicable, offensive films ever made.It's central message is that if you shut up, do what you're told and neverquestion anything, you will be rewarded. If you speak up for something youbelieve in, and it goes against authority, YOU WILL BE PUNISHED! (Like RobinWright's character, who dies of AIDS). That this won Best Picture over the innovative Pulp Fiction is appalling(but then again, let's not forget that Titanic beat out LA Confidential, andThe Truman Show wasn't even nominated) It deserves none of the accolades itrecieved, and as for Tom Hanks' performance, well let's just say that anysitcom-level actor can play retarded with ease. A bad, bad, bad, bad film,and in the nastiest way possible.
