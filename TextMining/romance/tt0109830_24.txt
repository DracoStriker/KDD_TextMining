This movie was amazing. It reminds me of my rises and falls in my lifeand just seeing how resilient Forrest Gump became was really inspiring.He had so much to offer the world, even when no one saw his ability tocontribute to society. He did everything from leading a football teamto a championship, to being a war hero. Even through the tough times inhigh school to the frantic relationship with Jenny, Forrest stillremained humble and resilient. Any anti-bullying campaign, in myopinion, should use Forrest Gump as a prime example. Maybe even go asfar as showing the movie. The movie also shows what it truly means tokeep a promise. The promises that Forrest made to his mother, Bubba,Jenny and Lieutenant Dan were all kept. His love, passion, drive andspiritual understanding were all unconditional. What an amazing movie
