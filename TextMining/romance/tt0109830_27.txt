I usually do not write comments about films that I hate, but this filmsucked so bad that I had to make an exception. This is one of the 10 worstfilms I have seen in my life. My profound apologies go out to those of youwho loved this film, but I just couldn't stand it.Let's start with the plot, wait a minute, there is no plot. The only pointof the film is seeing a not so bright man make his way through 30 years ofhistory. Throughout his life, he fought in Vietnam, and saved GarySinise'slife, who was very unappreciative of Forrest for doing so. He becomes amulti-millionaire in the shrimp business, he wins the internationalping-pong tournament, meets 3 presidents, discovers the Watergatebreak-in,sees his mother pass away, and then wastes 3 1/2 years of his lifeliterallyrunning from coast to coast and back again. (right), and finally his oneandonly love comes back to him only because she is dying of cancer. ForrestGump has been called the best feel good film of the 1990's, but I didn'tfeel good after seeing this film, and it's $350 million in the box officedidn't inspire me to enjoy this film.The thing that surprises me the most about Forrest Gump was the fact thatittook the Best Picture Oscar, even over Pulp Fiction, and The ShawshankRedemption. Two films that are so far superior to this one that I can'tevenbelieve it. For those of you who have not seen Forrest Gump, you'refortunate.
