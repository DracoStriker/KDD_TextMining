Forrest Gump (1994) is an awesome and breathtaking film directed byRobert Zemeckis. This is an exceptionally touching film with a greatcast, excellent choice of music and a thoroughly pleasing narrative.Some of the dialogue in this film is now commonly quoted in everydaylife which is a great achievement. It was a teeny bit long though,otherwise this film would have probably got a perfect scored.Despite Forest Gump's low IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with aringside seat for numerous of the most notable events in the late 20thcentury. without trying hard just other might do, Forrest teaches ElvisPresley how to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy,serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at ananti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies,defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon,discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimpingbusiness, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decidesto run back and forth across the country for several years.Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest neverforgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, whomakes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970sthat is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featuredalongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise ashis commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fatedArmy buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; andthe special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest during aremarkable array of historical events and people.In fact, nothing is quite pursued to its logical conclusion, whichmakes the film more a triumph of style than content. Nevertheless thisis certainly what it is. Gump is not so much a measure of its times, asa benign reflection upon them, nearly but not quite through the eyes ofits lovable protagonist. The film goes through all the emotions butdoes not appeal on any of them long enough to trouble anyone.
