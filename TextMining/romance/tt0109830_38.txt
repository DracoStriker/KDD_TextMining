I have to whole-heartedly agree with people who complained about the hype.I guess this movie was made to pander to the baby-boomers.  Why peopleinsist that Tom Hanks is a great actor is beyond me.  Don't get me wrong,Ithought he was brilliant on "Bosom Buddies," I just wish he would returntothe small screen.  I remember Bill Maher on "Politically Incorrect"remarking on Mr. Hanks winning the Best Actor award for this movie.  Hebasically asked how hard was it to portray an idiot?  I suppose TomServo'sdiatribe on MST3k accurately summarizes my opinion of this flick.Somethinglike, "Oh, so life is like a box of chocolates?  Oh yeah?  Well, I saylifeis like a c*** sandwich; the more bread you have, the less c*** you havetotake!"  If only there was more bread in this movie!
