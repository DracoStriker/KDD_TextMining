It really isn't a good sign when a film has you reaching for the sickbag after only a few minutes.This film features one of Tom Hanks's most insufferable performances,as the eponymous simpleton who embarks on an odyssey across America (and Vietnam - what did they do to deserve such a fate?). The scene inwhich Forrest's mother dies inadvertently provided some comic reliefafter interminable scenes of Gump running across America, meetingPresidents, and maintaining a frankly creepy crush on childhood"sweetheart" Jenny.This nauseating piece of reactionary twaddle is something the CIAshould consider as a means of extracting information from anyone theysaw fit. I'd be screaming for mercy after 10 minutes.And what were the Academy smoking when they gave Hanks an Oscar forthis turd? Avoid at all costs - but if you really must watch it abottle of whisky may numb your senses into submission enough to allow aviewing.
