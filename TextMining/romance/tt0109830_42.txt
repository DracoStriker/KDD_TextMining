This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite the bestefforts of the actors, most of whom are very talented, the ridiculous andcorny plot makes this a real chore to watch.You get the feeling that the director was trying to make a modern "Homer'sOdyssey", but ended up instead with "Homer Simpson's Odyssey" - sanslaughs.This movie offers lowest common denominator entertainment: patronizationtothose with learning difficulties, a twisted view on history, naivejingoism,and a nauseatingly contrived ending.When I first saw this movie I began wondering whether I was being tooharshon it. However, after talking to between fifteen and twenty other people,I've come to the conclusion that I was being quite fair. None of thoseI'vespoken to liked this film.If you like bubble-gum then you will probably like Forrest Gump. Ifhowever,you like movies with some semblance of intelligence or real entertainmentyou will probably be disappointed by this movie.
