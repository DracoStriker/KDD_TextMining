This movie suffers from a bad case of "schizophrenia". The movie startsout as a story about a boy who overcomes a handicap with a strongsingle mother (played by Sally Field). The movie could have been then a"low key" version of Radio and made a statement about the obstacles onehas to overcome. Instead, Zemeckis wanted to make a statement aboutAmerican history from the 60s to the 80s. The result was a judgmentalindictment without regard for the "complexities" involved. For example,we are supposed to think that Forrest Gump is so "dimwitted" that hedoesn't care about civil rights, when a young black woman is trying toattend class. Is Zemeckis mocking civil rights? Then there is somethingabout having to pee while shaking hands with LBJ. I guess some peoplefind this funny, but it just appeared childish to me. Then, Gump goesoff to Vietnam, leaving his "flaky", "irresponsible" girlfriend behind.You get tired easily of his girlfriend being portrayed as anirresponsible child. When he returns from 'Nam, he gets in a fight withsome pretentious hippy, who is supposed to represent the entireanti-War movement. This really irritated me seeing all the complexissues of the 60s being used to subjectively attack the anti-warmovement. After this slight, the movie moves on to a new story. NowForrest is running for no reason. In the movie "Convoy", where thisidea was borrowed from (switching from truckers to runners), thereseemed to be a little bit of a political message. Forrest is justrunning for no rhyme or reason. By the end of the movie, I am justannoyed by his talk about a box of chocolate. This movie was extremelyannoying, patronizing, and ignorant. Forrest Gump might of been abetter, more honest movie, if Zemeckis stuck to the storyline, insteadof pursuing a right-wing political agenda.
