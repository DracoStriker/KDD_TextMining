This might just be the best movie I have ever seen! It made me allkinds of emotional. There are parts that are so funny you will spit outyour drink but other parts make it hard to swallow. Forest Gump is asimple man with a simple heart but he sure knows how to tell a story.This is my favorite movie of all time and I wish I could watch it againfor the first time. I find that the worst part of the movie is theending with Jennie. I think the only thing that disturbs me is thatJennie only comes to Forest when she is sick and no one else will takeher and then she left... I felt as if Forest deserved more respect thanthat. However, the rest of the movie is golden. I 100% recommend itanyone in the world.
