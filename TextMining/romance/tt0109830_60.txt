The best film I have ever seen. If you are looking for somethingmeaningful here's the stuff!!! Cinema is all about how it makes youfeel. I think I felt in every possible way during this film at theright guantities the perfect moment. After this unsurpassed experienceI became a better person or more specifically I knew how I wanted to beas a person. Life is all about goodness and how you can help yourfellowman. You don't have to be smart, talented, gifted, handsome,tall. You only have to be hopeful. Have belief in your actions. Havebelief in the world, even in the darkest hours. When you have witnessedpure love, affection, kindness there is only one thing to do. Share it,share it to the rest of the people. Even if people believe you're wrongand nothing will change. It will.
