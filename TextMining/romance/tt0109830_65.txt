Wow. An incredible film. I watched many other movies of Tom Hanks, Nowi understand that i made a great mistake by not watching this moviethis long. This is such an epic. Terrific acting by Tom Hanks, dintknew that he was this versatile. The film just creates a very good feelinside you that even after watching it just hangs within your mind.Gump is spontaneous with great talent even though he looks retarded.Every scene in the movie drags our full attention into it, by thespontaneous actions of Gump. The movie's BGM is also perfect and syncsnicely with the scenes. Everything, everything is perfect for thisfilm. Such films are extremely rare. This should have been a multiOscar winner and indeed, it is. Watch it. No other words. Just watchand feel.
