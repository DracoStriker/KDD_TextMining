Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is sat on a bench waiting for a bus. He'shardly the most intelligent person in the world, but he's definitelythe most caring, heart-warming and relatable character to ever appearin film. Gump tells his story to other bus-waiters who come and go andonly hear snippets of the whole tale. The path towards present day ispacked full of events and achievements, some of which include theVietnam war, meeting the President (twice), unveiling the WatergateScandal and running non- stop for over four years. Sounds ludicrous.Above all else Gump has accomplished feats that would occur over manylifetimes. Tom Hanks though, fills Gump's story with tenacity. He hasan eventful life, one full of ups and downs. Very sad, but veryhumorous. A great film controlled by its lead man.
