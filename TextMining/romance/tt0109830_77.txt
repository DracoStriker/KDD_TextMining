I think it's the most beautiful movie i have ever seen The movie has itall too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well I haveseen this movie easily a half a dozen times "Forrest Gump" is one ofthe best movies of all time Tom Hanks' best performance He dideverything from leading a football team to a championship, to being awar hero. Even through the tough times in high school to the franticrelationship with Jenny, Forrest still remained humble and resilient. Abeautiful story.I can understand why it won 6 Oscars.Overall the filmForrest Gump is a great movie. It's definitely a movie you could rewatch and still enjoy it as much as the first time.There is no way todefine "Forrest Gump" as a movie. It can only be defined as art.
