before I Started watching this movie for the first time, I thought Iwas going to watch a slow and boring movie, but after watching , Irealized, I stupid I had been to judge this great movie even beforewatching it. I became a fan of Tom Hanks. I find myself similar toForest Gump. I don't remember how many times I watched it, every time Iwatch it, I feel great. I took great motivation from this movie. Soundeffect was great but most importantly the special effect used to bringback Ex Us President John F Kennedy was mind blowing. I recommend manyof my friends to watch it and they all loved it. Tom hanks acting wasout standing for what he won the Oscar eventually.
