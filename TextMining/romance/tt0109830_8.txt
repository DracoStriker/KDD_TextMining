FORREST GUMP (1994) **** Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, GarySinise, Mykelti Williamson. Brilliantly directed and inspiring comicdrama about the truly extraordinary life and times of mentallychallenged Forrest Gump (Hanks in the best role of his career won hissecond Best Actor Oscar in back-to-back winning roles), a simple,honest, and decent man whose childlike innocence is his lucky charmthrough his altering experiences that span the past two decadesflawlessly. Mind-boggling Oscar-winning computerized effects byIndustrial Light & Magic has Gump meeting the famous and infamous.Hanks is a wonder (dare you not to get a lump in your throat when itfinally registers that he has a child {yes, that's Haley Joel Osment}-watch his face!) and gets fine support especially Wright as the love ofhis life and Sinise as his best friend (Best Supporting Actor nominee)superior adaptation of Winston Groom's novel by Eric Roth (also anAcademy Award recepient) that truly captures lightning in a bottle.Oscars also went to director Robert Zemeckis and for Best Picture. ***One of my all-time favorite flicks. I still cry, particularly Forresttelling Jenny why he loves her so much ("You're my girl!") and at thegravesite when the birds fly overhead.
