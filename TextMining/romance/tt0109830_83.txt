Excuse me for the bad English. I want to start by saying this, WHAT AGREAT MOVIE. Since the first second of the movie I was mesmerized byhow amazing this movie is, I mean how often do you see a movie that hasit all, it's not based on a true story but it contains historyelements, like the Vietnam war, the Watergate scandal etc. It's alsonot biographical but you can see John Lennon& JFK, it's also a romanceand a comedy at the same time and of course DRAMA. It's brilliant to bein a movie that was a huge success both commercially with more than600M$(second most in 1994 behind only THE LION KING)and critically withsix Oscars (including Best Picture). Tom Hanks(Oscar winningrole)excelled in this movie, and he made the whole world cry with himin the scene when Jenny dies, he did the same thing six years later inCast Away when he made the whole world cry over a volleyball !!! .
