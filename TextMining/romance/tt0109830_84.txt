I have nothing to write for this movie. It's just so great job, actorsand everything around so I can't describe it. This is the mostrealistic and beautiful movie I've ever seen! Words can't say how muchthis movie means for me. I saw it when I was 8-years-old maybe and Isaid I didn't like it because I didn't understand it, well, I'm 14 nowand I have to admit I was seriously wrong. I don't understand peoplewho can hate this movie. Okay, it's their opinion if they don't like itbut if they hate it, they don't know what's life. They can't merge withthe story of the movie. This movie says so many things how we shouldall treat to everyone. Forrest was amazing guy and no one liked himjust because he wasn't rich or because he had wrong legs. And later? Hebecame popular just because of his acting and opinions. He was himself.All the time. He didn't care if people said if he's stupid, because forstupid person everyone's stupid. That's what most of people forgetthese days. They fall for others offenses very easily and they forgetwho they really are. Men these days care only about women and theirneeds. They don't know how true love looks. That's why I love thismovie. Because it's not just a movie. :) It's the movie. The life.
