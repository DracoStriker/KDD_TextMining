To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about thedialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it?  IF youmissed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss.  The restof us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.  I am athirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and thisone stands in its own entity, in my book.  It was not supposed to be adocumentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night.It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is thecynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on.Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! Howlame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on theplanet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side withthe majority this time around.Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I amdone.
