I've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch ofkids, 14 to 22 put on the DVD of "Titanic" on a fantastic state of theart mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them hadactually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate, Leoand Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen thewhole movie. Shortly after the epic started, they started to getrestless, some of them left asking the others -- "call us when theiceberg appears" Over an hour and a half into the movie, only the twogirls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They startedshouting: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all came back tosee the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed, emitting Ohs andfar outs. So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into thescene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thingto sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho, forinstance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place inthat film within the same period of time. In "Titanic" Leo teaches Katehow to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme dela creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at thehistorical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin thatthey have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about tosink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts arefocus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on tobecome the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do I know?
