It really physically hurts me when i don't see it in top 250 in IMDb'slist.I am from India where the general perception of Hollywood moviesare that they are more action oriented big budget entertaining films.Weconsider our films to be more emotional and poignant.However this movie is the most heart touching story i have ever seen onscreen.I could see people's faces with tears rolling down afterdeparting from the cinema hall.I could hear my father saying " Neverknew that these people could make such heart warming movies".Maybe i amgoing a bit too far.But this is my way of paying tribute to thegreatest movie ever made.
