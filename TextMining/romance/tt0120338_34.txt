 Sorry to pour cold water (if you'll forgive the fun) on this Oscar winningtribute to the programmers art, but this film is too long, too wooden andcaptures the atmosphere of Edwardian England to the same degree as Dick VanDyke mimics our accent. I have no doubt that the special effects are veryclever and took people an awful lot of hours and megabytes...but where dothey take us? A computer generated ship with generated seagulls looksexactly that. The sets are spectacular yet manage to scream out that theyare expensive sets rather than that they are the inside of a living workingship. And don't get me started on the levels of my indifference towards thetalentless Mr.DiCaprio who bestrides the film in the same way as mostchildren do when stumbling into a grown-ups party. Watch A Night To Rememberif you want to feel the real emotion of the Titanic's sinking and watch thisif you want to spend three hours seeing Mr.Cameron trying to show us howclever he is...and failing.
