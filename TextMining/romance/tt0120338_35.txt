I'll tell you what bugs me about this film.DiCaprio's pals were Irish.The dancing was Irish.The music was Irish or had an Irish feel.I just got the nagging feeling that the DiCaprio character was supposed tobe Irish too (but they chose a popular 'pretty' face for the male lead justin case). This nagged at me all through the film. It nagged me again when wewatched the video....Anyway... enough of this. Here is the spoiler....It sinks.
