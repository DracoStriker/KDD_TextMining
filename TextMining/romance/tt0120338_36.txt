The fact that this movie won an Oscar for Best Film is one of the biggestdisgraces of all time (it ranks right up there with Madonna not gettingnominated for her role in Evita).  Everyone loved this thing for somereason, but I found it lame and boring.  I was so glad when the end creditscame that I almost burst into hysteric joy!
