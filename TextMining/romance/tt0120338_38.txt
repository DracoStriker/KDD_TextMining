Let's sink this ship right now.  It's over, baby, there's nothing left!This is a BAD movie.  I'm not saying there's any harm in enjoying a badmovie, but some of you people have taken it too far.  Epic?  Greatest movieof all time?  Deserving of 11 Oscars?  I SPIT on the ground all of youpeople who have seen it five, six, seven times walk on.  Bad script +ridiculous acting + egotistical chucklehead director = PIECE OF FILTH MOVIE.I love watching piece of filth movies as much as the next guy, but all ofyou people with your Leo posters and your Titanic t-shirts and your GreatestMovie of All Time attitudes have driven me and others with even half a bitof common sense to HATE and LOATHE this "movie."  I no longer hold thislittle travesty in any higher regard than I hold "Hollywood ChainsawHookers," no offense to the "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"people.
