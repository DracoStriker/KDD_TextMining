okay, there's over 2000 comments on this garbage so this has probablybeen said before, but I think I'm gonna "force my own opinions to bedifferent so I can feel good about myself" LMAO containsspoilers....yuh...the boat sinks, people...Disgusting trash that is an insult to the real tragedy, no doubt it wasan effort to make and took talent...but so did Terminator, Aliens, TheAbyss, and any other of James Cameron's truly awesome work.If you think this is one of the "greatest films of all time", youhaven't seen enough movies...it does nothing to showcase the obvioustalents of its two main stars, Billy Zane is a joke, and the lovestory...c'mon...there are so many other movies with better love storiesI'm not even going to bother naming any...should be obvious to anyonewho cares.
