Certainly the worst movie ever made. Most expensive!!! What a waste. Idon'tthink it is worth the paper the script was typed out on.The story line, dialogue and cinematography was atrocious. I probably wouldhave enjoyed the movie more if the volume was put to 0.The final scenes were extremely unreal to say the least and probably themost funniest scene ever made.I definetely give this on a 0/10.
