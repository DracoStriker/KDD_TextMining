Well what can I say you gotta love a good disaster movie set on realevents and Titanic checks ALL the boxes for a good movie. Set in April1916 the movie opens with an elderly woman named Rose(played by thelate Gracie Stuart)who talks to the reporters(one played by Bill Paxtonfrom Mighty Joe Young) and she talks to them along with hergranddaughter about the story of the Titanic. So we cut in to see allthe people being sent aboard the famous ship and we see a youngerlooking Rose(played by Kate Winslet who looks so different with herdyed red hair)and her boorish fiancée played by Billy Zane(from ThePhantom)who is by her side as she sets sail on the ship. Meanwhile a charming man named Jack Dawson(played by the gorgeousLeonardo Di Caprio before he morphed into Eric Dane's love child now)ashe and his mates are playing cards so his friend decides to abort theship with him as he yells the famous line IM THE KING OF THE WORLD.Butlater in the film Jack falls in love with Rose while his staying on theship and the two become really close with each other. But what willRose's boorish egotistical fiancée think of it??.This film maybe 3 hrs long but its definitely worth it. The music byJohn Horner is brilliant there's this one scene I can recall where Jackand Rose are dancing to some Irish music and they had a lot to drinkand their smiling and laughing at each other,THAT was just so welldone. Also you gotta love the Celine Dion hit My Heart Will Go On.The story is brilliant in fact this is what REALLY happened on theTitanic and if you come across another movie that says Titanic: TheLegend Goes On I suggest you avoid this one and watch this overratedflick instead of it as the animated version well if you seen it youknow what its like.Also I loved the chemistry between Winslet & DiCaprio which was sorealistic and genuine. Bottom line if you haven't seen it then check it out im tellingyou,that you won't regret it. I seen it a million times before and if Icatch it again on TV at an earlier time than i'll watch it again.10/10
