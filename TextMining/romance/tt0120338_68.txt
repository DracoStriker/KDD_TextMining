Titanic is an over-hyped, over-rated piece of garbage. It goes an hour toolong and winds on for what seems like decades.The plot is a poorly written, romantic piece of rubbish and theperformancesby DeCaprio and Winslet are mediocre. However, Billy Zane and Kathy Batesbring some some hope to the non-existent story line.Putting the plot and acting aside, Titanic is a technical milestone. Thesequences where the Titanic sinks are nothing short of mind-blowing andyouwould think you are on the ship. It is lucky that the sinking of the shipisso brilliant, because after the length of time the viewer has to wait, itismuch deserved.All in all, this is a movie that should have sunk in an hour and ahalf.
