How long did it take for the Titanic to sink? Hours, it felt like forever. Why? After all that's the reason Cameron was attracted to thisstory. All those spectacular visual effects. But what about the people?They were irrelevant. Celine Dion and the bravery of Kate Winslet andLeonardo Di Caprio kept this wreck afloat. There is a wannabe thrillerabroad, gun fights, robbery... as if the tragedy alone wasn't enough.Remember the Titanic with Barbara Stanwyck? That version didn't makehistory but if you compared it to this one, the early one was amasterpiece. How angry it made me to think that all the millionsinvested in this Oscar winner didn't allow for a decent script toemerge. The surreal success of "Titanic" makes me fear the worse. Thecrowning moment of this puzzling hit is the jewel thrown into the sea.Why? Didn't Gloria Stuart had a niece? Couldn't she have secured alivelihood to her niece with that horrid piece of blue glass?Thoughtlessness, clearly, dominated the enterprise. However, thesinking in itself is an extraordinary show of technical ability.
