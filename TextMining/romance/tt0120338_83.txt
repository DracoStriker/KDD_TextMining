Why does this movie suck so bad?  More importantly, why did it win an oscarfor among other things, best picture?  There are so many holes in thefilm'splot, the villian is similar to one in a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon (Iwaswondering why they didn't give him a mustache which he could rub betweenhisfingers), the long sweeping shots of the ship look horrible, the script islame and filled with cliched action movie lines and all of the scenestakingplace in the present day are worthless and have no place.First, if Rose is telling this story from her perspective how is itthatshe knows what her fiance is always planning?  How does she know what thecrew of the ship is talking about before and after the iceberg hit?  How isit that she knows how exactly Jack got on the ship or what he talked aboutwith his friends onboard?  You get the idea?  Now many movies have thisproblem, but not a best picture winner.Second, the villian who's name escapes me.  He was so cliched.  So evilit was funny.  He's like Travolta in his new horrible film.Third, the fly over shots of the ship look like garbage.  They are soobviously fake, all the people appear as black, lifeless silohoetteswalkingthe ship.Fourth, the script.  How did these horrible lines that Jack utters getin there?  When danger is afoot, no matter how great all he can utter ishisbest Keanu Reeves impersonation.Fifth, what is the purpose of showing us the salvage crew?  Who giveswhat these idiots are thinking or doing.  It further complicates things.Why would these people believe an elder Rose just because she says she isthe one in the picture.  Anyone could call up and say that.  If they cutthese parts of you have a much shorter film.I HATE THIS MOVIE.L.A. CONFIDENTIAL WILL ALWAYS BE 1997 TRUE BEST PICTURE
