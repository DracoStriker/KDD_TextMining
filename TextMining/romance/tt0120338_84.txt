Not often you see a film where the leading man is prettier than theleadingwoman. The best performance in it is from Gloria Stuart as the old woman.David Warner does a very good impression of Leo G. Carroll. Kathy Bates isimpressive and so is the ship. I found Dame Kate and Leonardo thoroughlyuninteresting.
