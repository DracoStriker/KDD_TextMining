First of all, I must say that I didn't have much expectations to thismoviein the first place, but as a dedicated movielover I've promised myself tosee as many movies of any kind that I possibly can. The plot in the filmisno news to anyone, and DiCaprio's arrogant and childish acting is anenormous disappointment after seeing him in films like Whats eatingGilbertGrape?. Kate Winslet is excused, cause she's probably what they couldaffordafter budgeting the stunning effects and DiCaprio. As for the effects,they're of course outstanding, and the sinking sequence is probably someofthe most impressing I've ever seen.To sum it all up; first half hour good, the middle is THE most boringever,and the end is great, technically. If they've made this a documentaryinstead, and dropped the lovestory, it'd been a movie worth while, but asitturned out; I'm sorry, but the thumbs should be anywhere butup.
