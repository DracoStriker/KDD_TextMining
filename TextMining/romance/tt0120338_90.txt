Special effects not withstanding, I found the film a little hard to like.The scenes on the research vessel wern't too bad, but the roles of KateWinslet and Leo Decaprio were a little far fetched. Any well educated firstclass women would have found a better way to cope with the boredom of herlife than live with a steerage class passenger. In those times, you'd havebeen a fool to give up your high status. The attraction between Rose andJack is too '90s like. In addition, not enough effort is spent on the real passengers. Its asthough they're mearly part of the background. And they're treated as suchtoo. Not enough effort went into making them believable.What really gets me is Leo's line after he overhears the conversationbetween the officers discussing the iceberg damage: "This is bad." Wellduh!It might have helped if Cameron had watched A Night To Remember. He couldhave taken some clues from that film, which truely follows what happened. Infact, Cameron could have made a modern, special effects packed adaptation ofthe original movie. Then, Titanic could have scored even better without thephony love story that it concentrates on. While Titanic is a fine piece of work, like the real ship, there was stillroom for much improvement.
