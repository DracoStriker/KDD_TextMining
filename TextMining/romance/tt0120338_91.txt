The ship looks great...breaking up looks great...sinking looksgreat...They left out mega-important things like the "Californian", a ship whichsupposedly was only a few 100 yards away but had cut the wirelesslink...And why was it necessary to include this rubbish storyline regarding Jackand Rose (ice-fishing in a lake that DIDN'T EVEN EXIST UNTIL1920)...Therefore it gets 6 out of 6 for it's detailing of the ship and 0 out of 4for the storyline that was invented.
