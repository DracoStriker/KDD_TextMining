Can we say predictable?  Can we say simplistic?  Can we say a badly toldlove story with NOTHING new that exists only to fill time before a rollercoast sfx show happens?  Can we say 3 hours of annoying drivel written byhacks hammed up by "beautiful" media darling actors?We don't have to say any of this.  Cameron did it for us and spent WAY toomuch money doing it.Perfect 1.  Nuff said.
