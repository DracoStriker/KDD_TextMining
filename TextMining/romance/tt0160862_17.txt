She's All That has so much going for it that made a guy like me fall inlove with it. First, it is so 90's. That was the last great decadewhere everything was perfect. Teen movies were perfect, romance wasperfect, the music was perfect. The timeless pop song "Kiss Me" bySixpense NonetheRicher was used for this movie. And the other reasonwhy I love this is that it's the modern teenage take on my favouritemusical ever: My Fair Lady. Most people that didn't like this must nothave liked the element of that. Luckily, I fit in where I love thewhole 90's aspect as well as the roots of the film. I'm probably theonly person that feels this way, but I don't mind. In fact, that makesme feel like I have a special bond with this film.My Fair Lady is about a well-respected upper-class Englishman who betsthat he can transform a cockney woman into somebody classy. She's AllThat features the most popular guy in high school (Freddie Prinze Jr.)betting that he can transform the biggest basket case in school(Rachael Leigh Cook) into the prom queen. So the plot sounds pretty good eh? It is a process kind of plot whereit all depends on the outcome of the idea. Fortunately for this,everything even before is handled just right. We get to know our maincharacters perfectly and feel for them. We get to know why our leadinglady is so timid and our hearts go out. As our leading man falls forher, our heart goes out too. There is real chemistry and perfection behind the characters. This wasmade back when teen movies were made properly, back when party movieswere well done, and when modern day adaptations were faithful to theoriginal but still had their own spunk. I recommend this now more thanwhen it came out.5.8 is much too low.
