What? No, absolutely not, I don't want to see yet another version ofTaming of the Shrew made into a teen movie.What's that you say? It has Rachael Leigh Cook in it? OK, I'll drive.And that is pretty much why I not only saw She's All that, but alsobrought a ticket so I could see it on the big screen and then kind ofmaybe purchased the VHS and watched it a lot more than it deserved tobe watched.I know, I know, it's an obsession, but hey, she's cute AND she canemote a hell of a lot better than Jennifer Connelly and JenniferConnelly won an Academy Award.So As a result I've seen an unfortunate amount of Cook's movies.And this one was exactly what I thought it was: a '90s teen version ofthe Taming of the Shrew.So you know, if you walked out of this with your mind blown by theplot...either you never read Shakespeare in high school--which if youare my age could ONLY mean that you were in an LD class...or it meansyou are a Millennial that has NEVER seen a teen movie before.In either case, you know the plot, the only difference between thismovie and every other teen movie based on Taming of the Shrew is thatthis one stars Rachael Leigh Cook and is by definition slightly betterthan all the rest...regardless of actual quality.
