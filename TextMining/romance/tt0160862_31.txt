First off I love the song "Kiss Me" when they played it and she wascoming down the stairs before she fell,, I just love that song.. aboutthe movie, Freddie Prinze Jr. plays the local high school hunk,, hisfriend is played by a very young Paul Walker, I had totally forgottenthat he was even in this movie to be honest,, and I've watched itseveral times.. it's time for the prom and the most popular guy atschool get's dumped by a hottie, so she decides to hook up with thisobnoxious guy she met a spring break,, so his heart is broken, and hisfriend is like hey you can have any girl at school, so he makes a betthat he can get the nerdiest , or ugliest girl at school,, so thefriend picks out Laney Boggs,, who by the way was not ugly at all kindacute,, but definitely a little nerdy,, great film I thought and KiernanCulkin did a great job as well as the little brother,, this is a mustsee comedy,, don't pass this one by.
