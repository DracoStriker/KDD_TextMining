Here's one of the better teen comedies, I enjoyed much more than Ithought I would. Starring some upcoming stars, some of them who sadlyfaded into obscurity, much the same way as the ones did from AmericanPie, my only regret, was I should of seen this film fifteen yearsearly. Of course my reason for watching this, was for the late PaulWalker, who I must admit, didn't do a bad job here, playing a reala..hole, typically un Walker'ish. Although there are a few clichédmoments as in the progression of the story, I still found this reallyentertaining, the transformation, staircase scene, that was latermocked in Not Another Teen movie, another one. The unoriginal premisehas popular jock, Zack, Freddie Prince Junior, dumped by queen ofpopularity/vaingloried stuck up/bitch, Taylor. Now Freddie is given awager, by friend, Dean, a sort of meathead, to change a chosen dorkWalker's girl of choice), nerd, geek, rah rah rah, into the prom queen.Plain Jane, Rachel Leigh Cook, is the transformed one, where Zack, ofcourse falls in love with her, but a bets a bet. We know how the restof the story plays out, but the film's smart script, adds a lot offunny touches, like Laney's after school hobby, an artist ventinggroup. Too, is a reality show starring Taylor's new love, jock idiot(Matthew Lillard), a kind of Vincent Cassell looking guy, who in onescene, makes such an a.. of himself, it was even embarrassing, watchingfrom my end. Check out his bedroom. Here's one 99 film you must reallysee, a light hearted teen comedy, you can watch a few times. It hassome revenge too that I liked: consult Duval's new appearance, andWalker's deafened ears. I like Freddie Prince Junior too. He has acharisma, or magnetism about his presence, where I never really foundhim impressive as an actor, more someone who got lucky. Pollack is funas Cook's pool installer father, while Animal House's Matheson, poppingback on the screen as Zack's father, marked a nice return to the bigscreen. Don't knock this one.
