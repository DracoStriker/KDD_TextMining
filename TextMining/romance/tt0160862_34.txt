I was just thinking about this movie now in my head and so I might aswell do a review on it. The film is about a high school jock namedZachary(Prinze Jr) who's girlfriend is in love with another man(playedby Matthew Lillard who also teamed up with Prinze Jr 3 year later to doScooby Doo). Of course his heartbroken when Zachary's girlfriend dumpshim for Lillard's character. SO he decides that his mates(one played bythe late Paul Walker) can change any nerdy girl into a prom queen forZach to take to the prom as part of a bet(like that other film that wasreleased the same year 10 things I hate about you starring the lateHeath Ledger and Julia Stiles). Zach of course stumbles across a youngnerdy girl played by Rachel Cook who is a rather moody individual wholikes to paint and be creative. But when Zachary's sister (played byAnna Paquin)gives her a makeover,Zac falls in love with her. But is itfor real or is it only for the bet?Overall it was a cute harmless chick flick and its worth checking outif you like Freddie Prinze Jr. Oh and keep an eye out for SarahMichelle Gellar(Prinze Jr's wife in real life) and global superstarUsher aka Usher Raymond and Lil Kim(another singer) who star in thischick flick too.
