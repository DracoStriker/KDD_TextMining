As a fan of all those "late 90's teenage predictable chick-flicks," Ithought this movie was pretty good. Compared to others in the samecategory however, it's definitely not the strongest. The story is predictable: the popular guy makes a bet claiming thathe'll be able to make the school's biggest loner/outcast the promqueen. And, of course, by the end they fall for one another. Not a bigsurprise, but the story is still really fun to follow. With many wittyone- liners, there were many laughable moments. However, as a hopelessromantic, my favorite part is the one where Zach and Laney have a closeconversation concerning her late mother. I thought Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook worked really welltogether. The movie got REALLY cheesy at certain parts, not because ofthe lines (which also occasionally happened), but because of thecharacter delivery. However, I never thought either of the leadsoverdid it. They had good chemistry and I enjoyed watching the two ofthem. Although it's not the best film of this sort that I've seen, I stillenjoyed it and I'm glad I finally watched it. I would recommend it ifyou're having a girls night or are just in the mood for a 90's film.
