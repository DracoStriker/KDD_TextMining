Freddie Prinze Jr. definitely proves he can be a leading man in "She'sAll That." Furthermore, the storyline was well written and heartwarmingto watch. I enjoyed how the writers came up with the idea; "jock and cool guy"risking his reputation to talk with people who were not in his socialcircles. The girl, played by Rachel Leigh Cook, came out of her actingshell and turned into a butterfly with her role. All the young actors were refreshing to see since they broughtsomething special to their roles. I highly recommend "She's All That"because it is a really refreshing film to see. The new and upcomingstars break out and show what they are made of as well as thebelievable storyline; and how it flows together into one longcontinuous scene.
