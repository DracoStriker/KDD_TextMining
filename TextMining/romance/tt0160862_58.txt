While I was tormented in hs over my weight, at the same time, you NEVERsaw"the ugly duckling" with the "beautiful vain jock". That's what made itsounbelievable for me. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on a rental andwatched it on USA instead.Regarding the acting:Freddie Prinze Jr...he was okay. Your typical lovable jockjerk.Rachel Leigh Cook...very believable...when teased it brought tears to myeyes, reminding me of how cruel some kids can bePaul Walker...his character was an absolute JERK. I loathed him. But VERYbelievableJodi Lyn O'Keefe...her character was the kind of girl I would (now)probablybeat the crap out of. Nasty as hell, hated by most!The sequence where the students start dancing was too Grease-ish for measwell as VERY unbelievable. I loved the line in Not Another Teen Movie"Whowould've guessed that everyone in school was a professionaldancer?"...HELLO!!!3/10
