Out of the crazed teen-movie-mania of the late 90s this one is the only onedeserving anything more than a 1 or a 2.Yes, this ugly-duckling plagiate is as unimaginative as all the other topteen movies, but, this one isn't just about getting oral sex (such as theterrible-most movie of all time, Scary Movie, which I had the displeasure towatch in a cinema) and vaguely attempts to throw some supposedsophistication into itself, such as the experimental play.For the serious film fan, this is the only teener worth seeing, just so youcan say you are familiar with the genre (hey, keep an open mind!).As for the people who like the other films like Scary Movie, rent a porntape or consult with your local hooker, and I'm sure you'll derive moreenjoyment out of that. No need to add a non-storyline just to say it isn'tporn.
