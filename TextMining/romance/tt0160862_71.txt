This film is an obvious TV movie with a budget.  With no original dialogueanywhere and several  misplaced jokes, this movie was a strain to getthrough.  Some jokes even of the screw-ball comedy type that seems grosslyout of place and simply fall flat.  Freddie Prinze Jr. is completelyunlikable in his 'Brandon Walsh wannabe' role.  The writer who thought itwas a good idea to have him make two bullies eat pubic hair has never spenta minute in a high school.  It's empathetically akin to Nancy Regan's JustSay No campaign.  It only appeals to adults who have forgotten what it waslike to be a teenager.  Pure tripe.Kevin Pollak seems completely out of place in this film.  And that's a goodthing.  He is once again at the top of his game in this film.  He injectsthe only genuine emotion into the picture with his role as the clichésensitive dad.  I found myself wishing the script would follow him and hisstruggles as a single dad with Ally Sheedy from Breakfast Club and ForrestGump as children.  I just couldn't get myself to care about anyoneelse.There are so many better attempts at the teen comedy genre than this effort. If you want to see films like this, just tune into the USAnetwork.
