Like Rachel Leigh Cook says in the movie, this is sort of like Pretty Woman.She's All That is basically a teenage version of the film Pretty Woman. Likemost teen movies, the story is fairly predictable, but redeemed by a likableand energetic cast. Its hip, funny, and a bit sweet at the same time. Muchbetter than some of the junk Freddie Prinze,Jr. has been doing lately.3/4
