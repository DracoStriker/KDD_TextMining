Just by watching the previews, one can tell exactly what is going tohappenall the way through this movie. It really sucks bad. How can someone usethesame plot as a classic (Pretty Woman) and come up with such a suckyresult?I mean sure, Laney is not a hooker and there was not bet or prom queen inPretty Woman, but it really is the same thing. I also noticed that "Laney"is way prettier than any of the other girls considered to be made-over by"Zach". I could even make this girl look good. Just throw on a dress and alittle lipstick and she's not looking too bad.If you want to see a PG-13 teen movie, see 10 Things I Hate About you. Itisa lot better than She's All That. Or, if you just want to see a reallygoodmovie, rent Billy Madison or American Pie.
