SHE'S ALL THAT, in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, romantic, hilarious,touching, and heart-warming romantic comedy. When Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook)got her make-over, I thought she looked good -- Especially in the clothingshe wore after that point in the movie. As for Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), Ithought she was an absolute B****! This was because of her attitude and theway she treated Laney. When she poured beer on Laney's dress at one point inthe film, I wanted to grab Taylor and slap her on the side of her face.There was only one scene that grossed me out, and that was the pube pizzascene. Oh, that was REALLY gross! I mean, who would want to eat pizza withsomeone else's hair on it? That is so disgusting! When Zach (Freddie PrinzeJr.) showed up in the film, he looked REALLY hot -- Especially in the tuxedohe wore to the prom. Before I wrap this up, I must say that everyoneinvolved in SHE'S ALL THAT did an excellent job. Now, in conclusion, to allyou Freddie Prinze Jr. or Rachael Leigh Cook fans who have not seen thissweet, charming, romantic, hilarious, touching, and heart-warming romanticcomedy, I HIGHLY recommend it!
