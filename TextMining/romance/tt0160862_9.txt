While I would never put this film up with the contender teen flicks(American Pie for instance), if there was a pick between this and Bring itOn, I'd go for the first.  The story follows a smart, preppy, and popularteen (Freddie Prinze Jr.) called Zach who gets dumped by his girlfriend, butthen takes a bet the to turn a outsider art girl (Rachel Leigh Cook has somegreat charm and sexuality) into prom queen.  While I wouldn't call this thebest idea to turn someone's mindset like that, the film makes it almostwork, and slightly (though never completely) makes Zach's lifestyleapealing.  Sweet romantic comedy, though it isn't a quality flick. B-
