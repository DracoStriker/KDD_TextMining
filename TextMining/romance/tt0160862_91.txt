I'm addicted to watch them because I cannot seem to get my mind out of mydays in high school.  I can relate to all the stupid attitudes and anticsthat each character went through, and love of rooting for the underdogturned prom queen.  What gets me about these flicks that all seem to starFreddie Prinze Jr. is that they always break away from the story to have acompletely elaborate dance sequence that apparently all the students seemtoknow, no matter what clique they were in.  This movie had some hokeyunrealistic parts that never would've happened in the real world, and somedialogue that should've been left on the cutting room floor, but if youcanoverlook all that, then you will watch this movie on cable everytime it'splayed.  Kudos to Kevin Pollak's cameo character as Rachel Leigh Cook'sdad,playing Jeopardy at home and yelling out all the wrong answers.  Thatscenealways gets me.
