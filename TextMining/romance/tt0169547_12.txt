What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster.  Iwent in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure itwould be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only wasit worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film isvirtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, thenarrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is trulygroundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What reallysurprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In asmall,character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such greatcinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on inevery scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where firsttime directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being JohnMalkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though Ihave yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe thateither film will out-shine American Beauty.  This film should easily win asubstantial amount of the Oscars this year.  What's up with all the cirticsawards snubbing it so far?
