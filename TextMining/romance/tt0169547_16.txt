The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie andabout a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about andthen say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like thismovie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. Thisis one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performancesare one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. Thedirecting by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar.Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought andthere's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is theBest of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out(Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was thefirst movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over andover so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. Thismovie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's ranknumber 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it wasthe only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. KevenSpacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spaceybrings a great performance for a really deep and is just a greatcharacter. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed theOscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much,also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job andshould have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and isone the best film debut ever. This film was one the best ever made andshould be seen by everyone hows looking for great movie or how justwant have fun watching a movie.
