A movie brilliantly disguised as an entertaining sitcom-ish familydrama that takes every opportunity to establish the characters'individual story lines to the point in which the plot has expanded totwice the scope it had in the beginning. Every character feels like grounded people with their own arcs by theend and it's surprising how detailed they become. The comedic undertoneslowly becomes more unsettling as the events spiral to the extremes.Kevin Spacey, Anette Bening and Chris Cooper all give greatperformances in this movie that help make their characters moresympathetic while still with questionable acts.The trailer makes the movie seem like a generic 90s American familycomedy where the focus is in Kevin Spacey but that couldn't be furtherfrom the truth.It's a great subversion of the ideal American family taken to anextreme in which it could go any direction. And that it does.
