American Beauty is a romantic comedy that doesn't suck, which is a nicebreak. It follows a man stuck in an unhealthy relationship with hiswife and eventually falls in love with his 16-year-old daughter's bestfriend. It's an unconventional love story, and it's done beautifully. The plot is great. It's presented in a very comedic way and it'sactually very funny. It's interesting and realistic, which is a littlesurprising, but nothing ever felt out of place. The subplot is alsovery good, and while I think we've all seen it before I think that itwas the more relatable and serious of both plots, which created areally nice balance of both fun and seriousness.The characters are quite good too. You have a good idea of who theyare, and they aren't horribly far-fetched either. All of them wereflawed people, but not so flawed and that they were obviously fake. Alot of them, especially Kevin Spacey's character, were very likable aswell. Like I already said, the movie is very funny. But all the humor is donein a very natural way. During character conversations they might saysomething funny, but it's part of the conversation and further developstheir character as well as furthers the conversation, so it exists asmore than just a joke. Overall American Beauty is fantastic. The plot and subplot are verygood, the characters are great, and it's incredibly funny withoutfeeling forced. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie,so long as you're willing to be wowed.
