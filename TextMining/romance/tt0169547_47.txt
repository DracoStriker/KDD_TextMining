Tragedy meets melodrama meets the fearless hip '90s, following theBurnham family as they deal with their first-world problems. Lester andCarolyn (Spacey and Bening) are getting older, and both are trying intheir own way to hang on to the last moments of what each thinks is theprime of their lives; while their teenage daughter Jane (Birch) ishaving issues of her own, dealing with finding her identity and notfeeling pretty enough next to her "friend" Angela (Suvari). NeighboringFits family (consisting of Bentley, Cooper and Janney) work their wayinto the mix because the son is stalking Jane. A film that speaks tothose who have seen a midlife crisis, and is still entertaining tothose who have it to look forward to. Oscar-winner is entertainingright from the get-go, and is an experience as flawless as a rose uponfirst viewing. However, after you've seen it a few times, the rosebegins to wilt, unmasking contradictory characters and inexplicableevents that unfold just to appease its themes of confinement,conformity, redemption and sexuality?why does Lester lecture Carolynabout materialism right after HE's the one that bought a PontiacFirebird? Why didn't writer Ball or director Mendes at least try tomake Bening's character slightly redeemable? All the many otherquestions to raise require spoilers, but the list goes on... Hard tocompletely hate because it's easy to understand why so many people likeit.??½ (out of four)
