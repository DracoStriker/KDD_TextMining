Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama markstwo fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and SamMendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterlingefforts).Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of amid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of histeenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter(Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; "a typical teenager. Angry,insecure, confused...". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) hasan obsession of her own, her public appearance.Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their newneighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from theoutside.As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters findingwhat they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comescrashing down in the climactic final day.The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even moreamazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature filmscreen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experiencewriting TV sitcoms -  not  that you'd be able to guess from the toneof this film).The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendesmanages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast,who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing pastplayed a huge part in directing the actors so well.Another person worthy of a mention is the late director ofphotography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscarrecipients for this film.All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make onesuperb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, stealsthis film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film whatit is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10.
