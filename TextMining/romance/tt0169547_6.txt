This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I cameinto it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we'veall heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.Kevin Spacey plays this part to a "T".  He is strong when it requires andmeek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip topartake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both shouldbe nominated.The support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and MenaSuvari all give great performances as the troubled "Teenagers" in the film.Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supportingnomination as well.This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state ofturmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of hisdaughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated withher beauty.  Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change allaspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and hislibido.The music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when themusic fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one topresent a perfect emotion.The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to seewhere you go.  I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out nowthat are dare I say, trash.This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it iscertainly on top of mine.My Rating (1 - 10):  10
