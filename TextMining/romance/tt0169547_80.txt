I loved this movie.I have had this mad crush on Kevin Spacey since Ifirst saw it.I have probably seen it at least 10 times. Therelationship that he and Mena Suvari have is so (out there).It remindedme of my own (pre) mature thoughts about older men ,when I was younger.I really liked the oddness of it all.There were so many twists andturns that you did not know what to expect until they happened.It wasuplifting to see Lester get his independence.He made it all so worthit. For those of you that have never seen the TV movie "Homeless toHarvard" with Thora Birch you are missing a really good performance.American Beauty is by far one of my favorite top 10 movies of all time.Becky Brown , Fort Worth Texas
