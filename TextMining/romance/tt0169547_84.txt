This is truly an excellent movie. However I can see why some people donot enjoy nor like this movie, this is by no means the kind of movieyou grab some pop corn and drink then watch through it. This is a moviethat requires you to concentrate on every scene, and think about themeanings behind them. That is what makes this movie great.Unlike most movies in nowdays, there is no hero, there is no runningchasing blowing things up to give the audiences adrenaline rush. Thisis a drama that will make you re-evaluable your life with respect toyour culture, every protocol we know in life versus our desire to seekhappiness. It is a movie that in a very realistically subconscious waydepict our modern lives.I will not go in much detail here to spoil the movie, if you have notseen this movie, see it. I cannot guarantee that you will like it, butI can assure that if you think about what the movie is trying to say,you will have a happier life :)
