American Beauty is a brilliant drama, so powerful and moving. Havingread roughly what the film was about before I started watching it, Iwas pleasantly surprised by how multi dimensional it turned out to be.There was much more going on than I expected and all the story lineswere interesting in their own way. The plot goes much deeper than I imagined and it really is just abrilliant drama. It also has its comedy moments which help the film toflow. The cast in this all delivered very strong performances and madeit seem so real, especially Kevin Spacey. Wes Bentley is also deservingof a mention for his portrayal of the very mysterious neighbour. Theway it ended won't be to everyone's taste but for me it makes it morememorable. Overall it is a brilliant drama that I would highly recommend and Iwould certainly watch again. Top marks from me, one of the best dramasI've seen. 10/10.
