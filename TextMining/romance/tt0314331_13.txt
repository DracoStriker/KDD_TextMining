So.. is it just me or was anyone else greatly offended, if not outrightappalled by everything this movie had to "offer"? Not only was theacting simply awful with its cheesy lines and its predictablescenarios, but there were also so many different stories it made eachone lose any meaning it might have had in the process. On another lessgeneral note, I was offended by the fact that Colin Firth only startedto really find his Portuguese maid attractive once she stripped down toher underwear, Liam Neeson's kid, right after his own mother's funeral,claimed he wasn't distraught over her at all - it was LOVE that wastormenting him, and the comment made by the father of the Portuguesemaid to his other daughter - the "fat" one - saying "oh shutup, dunkin'donut 3000".... is this supposed to be funny? Because if it is, i thinki may have lost hope in humanity forever. What would possess anyone tonominate this movie for not one, but TWO golden globes? There is farmore to be said about this pathetic attempt at redeeming love andpeople in general, however it might cause me to feel ill so i willdiscontinue. My overall vote? If i could give it less than a 1, iwould. I am ashamed of anyone I know who has even remotely enjoyedwatching "Love, Actually."
