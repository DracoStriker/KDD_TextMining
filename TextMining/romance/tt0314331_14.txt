This movie represents everything I despise about modern film, and manythings I despise about the modern world. What the creators would haveus believe is that "love actually" is a series of short, shallowvignettes that reveal how hopelessly obsessed with sex and vulgarity weas a culture have become. "All you need is love," the closing refrainbegins, and I heartily agree. Try finding it in this film, and you'llbe miserably disappointed to the degree you'll begin to questionwhether or not true love, the love of Shakespearean sonnets and classictragedies, even exists at all. So bleak is this film's representation of human existence that at timesI wondered whether or not the film was made as an intentional,existential mockery of our lives. Alas, I don't think it was. Thisleads me to the mortifying conclusion that all those who produced thefilm, and those who enjoyed it, are fixated with pitifully infantiledefinitions of human relationships. It's pap, actually. Unadulteratedpap.
