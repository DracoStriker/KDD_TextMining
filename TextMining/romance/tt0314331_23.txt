I cannot believe that anyone who likes movies enough to post or evenvote on IMDb would actually like Love Actually. After peeling mymangled body from the floor of my apartment I crawled to the phone andcalled every movie buff I know and warned them about this foul-smellingdebacle. Expecting at least good acting in a movie I knew would be asappy British comedy, after the sixty-minute mark I begged mygirlfriend to let me turn it off. I didn't even notice the misogynyuntil after the smoke had cleared from my head after watching two hoursof bad lines, worse plot, and disastrous humor. I felt like I had beendrug all over London watching stupid people doing stupider (sic)things, and drugged on a never-ending storyline that, at rareintervals, might have required a teaspoon of creativity. The portrayalof women was also completely inappropriate. It was a class strugglethroughout: authoritative and powerful men and the lowly enamored womenacting like they're at a Beatles concert. If you haven't seen a poorlymade movie in a while, see this film. Even my girlfriend agreed that itwas not at all good, and was as surprised as I was that it averagedabove a 2 on the voting. You want a holiday comedy? Watch Elf. Iusually don't comment on IMDb, but after seeing the 7.8 I couldn't helpmyself.
