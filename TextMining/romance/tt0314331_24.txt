This film is truly wonderful.  I went to see it at the cinema twice andhavewatched the DVD 4 times since it was released.  The inter-twiningrelationships is nothing short of genius and the all-star cast areperfect.Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson without doubt play my favourite characters asthe ageing rockstar and the betrayed housewife.  Hugh Grant is superb asthePrime Minister with a fantastic speech I would love Tony Blair to havegiven!!The opening and closing scenes at Heathrow Airport Arrivals made me cry,infact, I cried and laughed out loud at every viewing and have still nottired of it.I am astonished to see the bad reviews on the IMDB website - what a bunchofgrumpy people there are out there!  When there is so much hatred andviolence in our modern world, who wouldn't want to see some light-hearted,uplifting humour?I literally have nothing bad to say about it and would recommend it toabsolutely everyone.
