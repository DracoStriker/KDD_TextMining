This is one of my all time favorite movies, definitely in my Top 10.Richard Curtis has done a wonderful job of writing and directing a verylarge cast and yet you connect with each character. Their lives, hopesand dreams of finding or keeping the love that so eludes many of us.The cast is superb. I can't single out one out of them all because theyare just all terrific. The way that Mr. Curtis has used music is great.The music selection plays a major role for each character and isperfect. From "Both Sides Now" by Joni Mitchell to Kelly Clarkson's"The Trouble With Love Is" is both moving and haunting and I don'tthink I'll ever associate these songs with anything else except thismovie. They belong here rightfully. Thank you Mr. Curtis, for giving usthis wonderful love story that gives me the hope and courage to go outand find my one true love.
