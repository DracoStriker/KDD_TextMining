It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me smile, hug everyone, telleveryone how much I loved them!!! I think the music is the true soul ofthis movie. Cheers for the director!!! So many beautiful films he'sbeen doing for so long!!! There was no need of marvelous photography,neither splendorous costume...but every detail was placed perfectly.Excellent actors and performances. It was a very good combination ofexperienced ones and some others one had never seen before. I likedvery much how the director showed how open minded the English peopleare, by the way Liam Neeson talked to Sam and some other aspects onother dialogues as well (related to sex) It is remarkable also the waythey mention the American society. Not criticizing the people and theculture, buy yes the government. CONGRATULATIONS ENGLAND!!!!
