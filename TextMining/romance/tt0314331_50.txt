"Love Actually" was praised by critics and friends alike, and so Irented it.Did anybody else in the world felt like they weren't watching a movie,but a horrible soap opera gone wrong? Stretched too thin amongstory lines, this movie scratches the already skimpy surface of clichélove plots. Shallow, shallow, shallow movie. I'm amazed I even finishedit.I'm not an anti-romantic; some of my favorite films are EternalSunshine of the Spotless Mind, Los Amantes del Circulo Polar, and JulioMedem films in general. This movie makes me feel absolutely insane; am I the only one whothought it was the most horrible movie ever? I've read some negativereviews here, but none seem to tap into the sheer horror of it all.
