There are directors who can hold together a film containing severalnarratives (Robert Altman, Woody Allen, Ron Howard, to name but three) butRichard Curtis fails miserably.There's a good film in there somewhere struggling to get out but RichardCurtis the director has employed Richard Curtis as writer and his partnerEmma Freud as script editor, so there's no one to tell him that actuallysomany strands don't work.The Hugh Grant/Martine McCutcheon story is charming if implausible, butdidn't Rob Reiner do it so much better in The American President? AndCurtisseems convinced that swearing itself is funny.The Colin Firth story works much better and provides the film's bestlaughs.Emma Thompson is brilliant as the wife discovering her husband is at leastcontemplating an affair, but Alan Rickman isn't convincing. Surely such anintelligent man wouldn't really be interested in an affair with the cheapaschips office girl.Keira Knightley is beautiful and charming in the touching segmentinvolvinga nicely understated performance from Andrew Lincoln as the dotingunspokenadmirer.Bill Nighy camps it up in fine style as the ageing rocker, but the comedyislaid on with a trowel.The worst strands of the film involve the bereaved Liam Neeson and hisstepson - the airport scene is particularly emetic, the out-of-placesimulated sex scenes featuring Martin Freeman and the ludicrous sectionthatimplies that any English nerd would be viewed as a sex god inAmerica.
