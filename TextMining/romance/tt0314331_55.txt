As a man it's a little embarrassing to admit I enjoy a good rom-com,but I do. There's something great about getting to know two people andwatch how their relationship unfolds through the inevitable highs andlows of dating, particularly when the stories are grounded in real-lifein a way we can all relate to.Unfortunately, Love Actually is not one of those films.I can only imagine the writers sat down one day and decided that itwould be a great if they didn't have to worry about story lines, orcharacter development, or emotional depth, and instead could simplycram as many different "happy endings" into a single film. 20 minutes later, Love Actually was born, hoorah!
