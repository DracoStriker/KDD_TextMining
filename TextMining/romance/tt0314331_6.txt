This was a lovely script, and I was surprised I hadn't heard much aboutthis movie before I caught it on HBO. I turned it on to keep myselfcompany while working and ended up glued to the screen. I reallyenjoyed it.The movie is a series of vignettes about several different people thatseemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end theconnections are finally all present and accounted for. There's a fairamount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the charactersare quite human and often don't do the right thing. I was caughtoff-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America,but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn't have written thescript any other way. Not everyone ends up getting what they want, butthen again that's love, er, actually. Nice little film.
