The entire movie was so amazing, absolutely the best film on love evermade! I absolutely love John the sex double! "I'm really quite shyabout this sort of thing..." Love it!!! I really thought that themessage of love and its many forms was conveyed so beautifully! It wasNOT by any means just ANOTHER LOVE movie. In fact, the idea and conceptwere startlingly original. One would think, "Oh, rubbish! It's only amovie about love, C'mon now!" This however, is heart warming,sensational, emotional... I was actually jumping up and down cheeringfor love to prevail. It's truly astounding and I suggest you watch it.Whether you are looking for a good laugh or looking for love, this isthe movie for every one.
