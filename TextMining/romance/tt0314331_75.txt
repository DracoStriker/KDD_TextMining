Love, Actually is terrible, actually. Without resorting to hyperbole,this has got to be one of the worst films in the past 20 years. Fromthe ridiculous dialog (look no further than the precocious little boy),to the insulting "plots" (Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister is about asbad as John Wayne playing Genghis Kahn), this movie has no redeemingqualities; It's almost as if this movie was written as a dare to seehow bad a film someone could actually get released. If futuregenerations of archaeologists unearth this piece of trite crap, I'mafraid we'll be viewed as a society of half-wits and gibbering,drooling idiots.....I don't think Rob Schnieder could have done a worsejob. Boooooooooo!!!!!!
