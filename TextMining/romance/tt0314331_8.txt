Any picture that can have me rooting for Rowan Atkinson (who I usuallydetest as Bean, actually) has to be very well-crafted for mypart...Rowan was the Angel Of Conscience in the film he helped the son of thejust-widowered Liam Neeson's character by pass Customs to pursue true loveof a little school-mate who happened to be a fine young Afro-Americangirl(this was where love did not know Race... Color-Blind), but he dideverything to make Alan Rickman as the publisher think twice before he effedup his marriage for a bit of materialistic fluff! (The gift-wrappingsequence in the department store was annoying, hilarious and Bean-esque allat the same time w/o conflicting.. Amazing!!)Bill Nighy as the old rocker who discovered platonic love was marvelous;Hugh Grant (brother of Rickman's wife in the flick) as the goofy good PM whoeffed up Billy Bob Thornton's "Bushy" prez was superb and I liked the girlfrom EastEnders as his love interest, it shows true love knows no class!Love knows no language was shown in Colin Firth's attraction to hisPortuguese assistant when recovering from Romance betrayed - another aspectof love, actually...Kiera Knightley and her weird triangle was a great twist, I thought thewhite guy had a crush on her husband not her! Ten stories linked in theweirdest ways and showing that love is Universal! As for the tunes, theywere sublime and it was weird to see Bill Nighy's send-up really did do wellin the UK Xmas charts! The Power of Love, actually!
