I'm a guy, an old, straight guy, which means I like movies where stuffgets blown up, and this is quite simply my favorite movie.It's not for everyone as the writing is clever and will probably goover the heads of some, but what an amazing film this is.If you don't feel good after watching this movie, you're probably anignorant schmutz. This is as good as it gets. I never get emotionalwatching a movie, but the Green Mile and this one get to me every time.Amazing acting and an intricate series of subplots cleverly woventogether. My favorites are the author and the Portugese girl, Colin theLove God and the little boy. If you like to be entertained and moved, and every movie doesn't haveto have people and property blown to bits, this is the film.
