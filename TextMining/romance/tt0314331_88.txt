Well, first for all we had many stories together, and rather very knownenglish actors making love stories weeks before christmas, and presentsrather many situations of love we have to live in our lives (the firstlove,when we lost someone we love, love for a person that doesnt speaks alanguage we dont know, love in goverment, when we have love in marriageandhave to split up, the choose between love of family and an occasionallover,and many others) and here we see many changes through movie, but dont getlost, because faces are known.Like very much actors, we have many famous names (hugh grant, bill nighly,colin firth, laura linney) as well as new leading actresses (keiraknightley, martine mcchucteon) and not very known people (lucia moniz,rodrigo santoro, abraham lincoln) presenting us that love can be in lifealways, in many ways, and that you dont need neccesarily to have aboyfriendor girlfriend to be happy.It was very criticated because it was english, and is universally knownthatin Britain they dont have to show love in many ways, but I really thinkthatlove has no countries and as movie says: "love actually is allaround".
