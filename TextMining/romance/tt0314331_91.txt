This is a great movie to see. I think that it couldn't arrive in a bettermoment, just when we need that exact amount of laugh, love and relax. Themessage of this movie, behind all those great stories, is one of the bestmessages a movie can send. Love is all around, even in this violent and"modern" world.The stories are all great, they are funny, touching, emotional, but aboveall real...perhaps they don't all end happily, but thats life, and in away,they do end happy if you see behind them. The performances are great,everybody shines in their way, you will laugh with all of them becausestories are treated equally and none outcasts the others.Sometimes I think its unbelievable that such a simple movie can show thebest of humanity, which is love in every way, not only couples, butfriends,parents, children, partners, brothers. This is the kind of movie I reallyenjoy because apart from the fact that is really really  well done, andmakes you laugh a lot, it leaves you a brilliant sensation and, as I said,its message its so simple, but yet so true and so necessary these days.Please, go see it!! You wont regret it! I want to see it againalready!
