Just finished to watch the movie...Tears of joy mixed with hysterical laughs over the dialogues.Perfect actors' play, perfect story, perfect everything...Nothing less to say, 'cause I'm still under the big impression.I could say about pure & total win of english romantic movies overamericanones which can't exist without "toilet humor" (as we say here, in Russia)for last four, maybe five years, but won't say a word about it.:-)Thank God, there is still good movies like "Notting Hill" or "LoveActually".10 out of 10. (Sorry for my overlimited romantism, guys :-))
