I wanted to like this movie having been a fan of Bridget Jones, NottingHill, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth but thatwouldbe too much to ask. Richard Curtis has written and directed an awfulmovie.Don't waste your money! The best parts of the movie are shown in thecommercial; everything else is rubbish. I expected more and was quitedisappointed. Looks like Richard forgot to love this movie. It's notfunny,it's not romantic, it's too long and it's misogynistic. They make fun ofwomen especially those who are slightly overweight and older. Easytarget.Why not make fun of bald or balding men? There seems to be an abundanceofthem on both coasts. Seriously, there were some cute moments but theydon'tmake the whole worthwhile. In fact, there are some downright depressingparts. Skip the movie and watch Bridget Jones again or About a Boy - muchbetter than this.
