Elf (2003): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Will Ferrell, James Caan, ZooeyDeschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Bob Newhart: The story of little peopledoing big things, or in this case big people doing even bigger things.Will Ferrell stars as Buddy who crawled into Santa's sack upon hisvisit to the orphanage. He is raised at the North Pole where cheer andgood will are the norm. When he learns that he is human he treks to NewYork to reunite with his human family. His father works in publishingand sees Buddy as a lunatic. He eventually lands a job in a toy storewhere a young lady with a winning singing voice catches his heart. Neatconcept and funny situations and a conclusion where Buddy obtains thebest of both worlds. Directed by Jon Favreau who previously made a verydifferent film called Swingers. This time he aims for a differentaudience. He is backed by Ferrell with outrageous bursts of enthusiasmin an overgrown elf costume that is appropriately out of place. JamesCaan makes a great foil as his father. Zooey Deschanel is pleasant butas a female shop worker she is a predictable romantic prop. The biggestdisappointment is Mary Steenburgen who is limited as Caan's wife. BobNewhart narrates the film as Buddy's parental elf, which adds thatfable like affect to its presentation. Hilarious Christmas comedytaking the elf theme to new heights. Score: 9 ½ / 10
