A nice Christmas-themed movie. Nice is very apt for this title, as Iexperienced it never really either shone or sucked. Just nice. A fewscenes that made me laugh audibly, and a lot of scenes that made mesmile.I didn't really give me anything new, the plot was very predictable andkind of tame. It was nice to see Will Ferrell in a role where hischaracter didn't have these ridiculous scenes where he overplays tomake it hilarious and just misses the spot. The funnier scenes werewell played out by Will and fit the character of Buddy the Elf.Sounds like my impressions of the film doesn't coincide with my ratingof it, but it was a perfectly fine Christmassy flick that left me witha smile. I might just watch it again next winter.
