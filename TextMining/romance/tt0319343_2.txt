Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, littlebaby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elvesas one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to theelf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New Yorkto find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn'treally fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejectshim.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I alsothought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided togo and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof onthe DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film wasrefreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in aseasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoyrather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids'type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoidthis usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not beall Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is prettyfunny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to theaudience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but hasto work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner andSteenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of waterjokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny andrefreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance fromFarrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of sparkand wit.
