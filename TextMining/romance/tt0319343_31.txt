Will Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, EdwardAsner and Bob Newhart star in this 2003 comedy. This tells of humanelf, Buddy (Ferrell) who is an orphan raised at the North Pole. Newhartplays papa elf who tells him about his real father, Walter (Caan) wholives in New York. Buddy embarks there and gets into mischief whiletrying to get to know him. Walter not only has a hard time acceptinghim as his son, but he's been consumed with work and hasn't spent muchtime with his family. Walter eventually bonds with Buddy and gets hispriorities straight. Buddy also finds love with woman, Jovie(Deschanel) who works as a mall elf. Steenburgen plays Walter's wife,Emily and Asner (Lou Grant) plays Santa Claus. Ferrell is great in thisas usual and I recommend this good holiday comedy.
