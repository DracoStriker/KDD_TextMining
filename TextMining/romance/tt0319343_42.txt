With Christmas just having finished,I've decided to take a little bitof a break from watching two of my favourite Christmas films (BobClarks definitive Xmas film-A Christmas Story and the surprisinglystrong Muppets Christmas Carol.)and to try out something that I hadbeen looking forward to seeing for the last few weeks.With a surprisingly strong cast,a charming screenplay and a huge dollopof charm,the movie is something that can easily keep kids and adultsvery entertained over the holiday period.The plot: When Santa returns to his factory, from having dropped off all thepresents.He makes a shocking discovery,that a baby has gotten into oneof the sacks.Santa decides that the best thing to do is to let one ofhis chief elf's-Papa Elf raise the baby(whose named Buddy).Due to beingraised by elves, overtime Buddy starts to believe that he really is anelf.Sadly one day at the factory,Buddy hears some of the other elvessaying that they can not believe,that he does not realise that he is ahuman!After hearing this,he tells Papa Elf that he wants to go and meet hisreal father(who does not know that Buddy has even been born).Afterhearing all of this,Buddy becomes very determined to give his dad thebest Christmas ever.Though due to his dad now being too stuck into hisjob,Buddy has a huge mountain to climb,to get his dad to join in thespirit of Christmas. View on the film:Though the scenes where Will Ferrall is stuffing his face full ofsweets,made me cringe (and not in the way that the film makers werehoping for)due to how forced the joke felt.Surprisingly,Ferrall makesBuddy stand out from all of his other fantastic characters,by removingany sense that Buddy has a very inflated-ego.and replacing it with avery natural sweet (though not sugar-coated) personality.Ferrall isgiven huge support,by a shining performance from Zooey Deschanel as thewonderfully punk style Jovie.Deschanel impressively shows Jovie goingfrom being very agitated,to finding Buddy completely irresistible in avery enjoyable way.Whilst the screenplay by David Berenbaum,could be seen as a very broadup date of A Christmas Carol (with Buddys dad having to learn the truemeaning of Christmas)Berenbaum thankfully,gives most of the traditionalXmas set pieces for films,a fun modern trust (such as having the elvesmake modern plastic toys)Smartly David makes sure that the story isalways the heart of the film,and that you are always followingBuddy,and hoping to see his dad accept him for what he is...Final view on the film:A great film for the whole fame,with a stunning cast and aheart-warming story.
