Stars: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Ed Asner, Zooey Dechanel, Bob Newhart,Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gaas, Artie Lange.Let me start by saying that I thought all the performances in this filmwere good. Will Ferrell was good, James Caan kept the movie afloat, BobNewhart was a great presence. With such a great cast, I'm amazed theymade such a mediocre film. The character of buddy the elf is kind of aone note joke, "fish out of water" character that really has nodevelopment in the film. Buddy is a human, who was raised as an elf,that goes back to New York to visit his birth father who never knew hewas born. In New York he acts like an idiot, getting hit by cars andeating gum off the bottom of benches, etc. Buddy meets a girl played byZooey Dechanel, who has a problem singing in public. I guess this movieis good for kids, but I found it to be very stupid. I thought BobNewhart's narration (through the beginning and at the end) was a nicetouch.My rating: C. 94 mins. PG for crude humor and mild language
