A great holiday comedy, destined to be a minor classic. Better than JINGLEALL THE WAY but not quite as good as A CHRISTMAS STORY, this razzle-dazzlefantasy by actor-director Jon Favreau tells the off-center tale of a human,played by a rather fey Will Ferrell, raised by Santa's elves, who at age 30goes off in search of his father, a New York City book publisher played by aweary-looking James Caan. Much hilarity ensues, as the merry Ferrell teachesthe frumpy Caan the true meaning of Christmas. Some delightful touches suchas a bunch of Rankin-Bass-type North Pole creatures including a BurlIves-ish snowman played by Leon Redbone and an adorable penguin with botheyes on one side of its head. Lots of attention to detail (for instance,note Caan's apartment after Ferrell has transformed it, including the dozensof Christmas cookies on the kitchen counter). Some hysterically funnymoments, such as Caan coming upon Ferrell sleeping in Gimbel's (yes,Gimbel's!) window and Ferrell running full-tilt into a steel locker aftersurprising Reese Witherspoon-lookalike Zooey Deschanel in the shower. Thisis the film that makes Ferrell a bona fide star, by the way. It owes nothingto SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, thank God, being wholly original in thought andcontent and character. In the end, ELF goes on a bit long, it falterswhenever Ferrell is offscreen, and the ending is a bit too much...but whatthe heck. By the way, the movie is just this side of being a musical, whichwill surprise and delight many moviegoers. The soundtrack is simplymagnificent, filled with memorable holiday tunes including a nice duet of"Baby It's Cold Outside" featuring Ferrell and Deschanel.
