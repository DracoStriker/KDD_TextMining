Yes, it's true that this is another delightfully told Christmas story.Yes, it has some laughs for the whole family. Yes, it's original andmaybe a little heartfelt. But, it just falls short of being somethingmore.It has its moments, but I think the story overall doesn't have a lot ofluster to it. This movie seemed constrained to maintain its "familymovie" status. Which is fine, but there were too many moments thatseemed to stoop down a level just to please the younger audience.In addition, the ending was completely not what I expected. Basically,the movie adds up to being a fine holiday family film, but it justwasn't special enough to be truly memorable.
