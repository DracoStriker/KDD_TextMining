I love this movie. I saw it with my mother and we laughed out loud inthe theater. The humor in the film is very family friendly and everyonewas laughing hysterically. I loved every scene in the movie andeveryone played a great part. I can't think of many funnier Christmasmovies. It is funny for all. For all of the haters of this film, youmust not like family friendly humor. It's not Bad Santa and it isn'ttrying to be. Will Ferrell is a hoot. Jon F. does a great jobdirecting. Zoe D. is a great fit as the love interest. Bob Newhartplays his usual dry self and that adds enjoyment. James Caan as thegrumpy dad is also a nice fit. All in all, it is a fun Christmas movie.Just watch it and enjoy.
