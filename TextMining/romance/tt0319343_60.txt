Buddy was a baby in an orphanage who stowed away in Santa's sack andended up at the North Pole. Later, as an adult human who happened to be raised by elves, Santaallows him to go to New York City to find his birth father, WalterHobbs. Hobbs, on Santa's naughty list for being heartless, had no idea thatBuddy was even born. Buddy, meanwhile, experiences the delights of New York City as only anelf can. When Walter's relationship with Buddy interferes with his job,he is forced to reevaluate his priorities......Elf isn't as clever as it thinks it is, but it shouldn't be this goodeither.Ferrall has never been better as the titular character, and it's due tohis child like prowess and body language. It's a shame he's never really hit this high in a long time, as he isreally likable in this, and makes this movie a little more magical.The rest of the cast are fine, but this is Ferralls movie all over theshop, and there is hardly a scene where he's not in it.It gets a little soppy at the end, but it's a Christmas movie, so allis forgiven.Funny and touching, if a little too blunt with its message.
