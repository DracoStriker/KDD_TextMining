As a baby, Buddy {Will Ferrell} crept out of his crib in the orphanageright into Santa's goody bag. Thus he grows up at the North Poleworking with the elves in Santa's work shop. Now firmly grown upphysically, Buddy is shocked to learn that he is a human being, not anelf. So upon hearing that his father lives in New York, he sets off tofind him. But can he survive New York? More to the point, can New Yorksurvive Buddy?Like him or loathe him, Will Ferrell has a nice line in physicalcomedy. So with that, Elf is the perfect vehicle to showcase hisexuberance. But with that also comes the problem with the film. For itfeels {actually it is} like director John Favreau and writer DavidBerenbaum have plopped Ferrell into a fish out of water scenario andstitched together a number of sketches for him to run thru. The outcomeof which may induce some amiable comedy along the way, but renders thefinale a weak attempt at holiday message emotion. The supporting castalso suffer in the wake of Ferrell's domination. Something that annoyswhen you consider we have the likes of James Caan and Mary Steenburgentrying to breathe on the sidelines.There's enough here to make it a safe holiday viewing for the kids andthose adults who have a penchant for Ferrell's comedy. But really it'sa patchwork quilt of a picture, with the makers playing it all too bythe numbers just to sell tickets. 5/10
