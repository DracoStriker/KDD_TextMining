The film is something quite intriguing with a very unique plotline; from thebeginning it looks to be very promising and, is, in fact, promising.However, it misses a certain something that becomes more apparent throughoutthe film: after a while the pure immaturity of the Elf slowly begins to wearaway on you until the film loses all of the original appeal that it had.Nonetheless, the film has some delightfully entertaining and hilariousportions, though overall it leaves much to be desired. The ending drags outpainfully and becomes torturingly corny, nothing that is unpredictable aboutit. In spite of the ups and downs that one has when watching the film, it canstill be called a decent film. There was some very good exercise of comedyand admittedly it is superior to many of the films that have come out, butif you were hoping for anything more than just a slightly entertaining film,you will be disappointed. Aside from the minimal comedy to keep youinterested nothing more is offered by the story.The movie should make you laugh, and the movie is worth seeing, but again,it is far less than the Christmas classic that people are claiming.
