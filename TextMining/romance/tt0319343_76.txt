It is incomprehensible that this film garners a 7.1 on here. It'ssappy, stupid and obnoxious. Used to be that stars who had a name wouldbe worried about being involved in a film that was totally vapid. Thatday is long gone. The story is so stupid. The ending is so sentimentaland dumb. As the sputtering blunderbus flew off during the climax ofthis piece of crap, I could only think of the scores of starving peoplewho could have been fed instead of spending millions on this uselesspablum. And John Favreau doing this is all the more hilarious. The wayhe chomps his cigar while waxing unpoetic about the biz on Bravo, you'dactually think he had more in mind than just cashing in on pieces ofgarbage like this. The whole cast looks like they are attending a wakeexcept for Will Ferrell who turns in another classic post-SNLperformance: one dimensional, schticky idiocy that might work in a 2mskit, but leaves you numb after an hour and a half.
