I will be honest. I could not make it all the way through this film.The idea of a 30-year-old man acting as if he was developmentallydisabled was too much for me to take. In fact, I don't know any peoplewith developmental disabilities that act like him.Belching loudly and eating spaghetti with syrup was gross, not amusing.There was nothing amusing in the hour I managed to stay - I couldn'ttake any more! James Caan looked as if he needed a big dose of ex-laxthe entire film. I would not smile either if Ferrell was my son.Zooey Deschanel going out with Ferrell. That's about as dumb asKatherine Heigl hooking up with Seth Rogan.The only redeeming quality of this movie was Mary Steenburgen and PeterDinklage. Even they couldn't save it.
