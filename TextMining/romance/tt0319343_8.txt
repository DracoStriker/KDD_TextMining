The most helpful thing I can tell you about this movie is that ifyou've got even a smidgen of a youthful spirit about you, then thismovie will make you laugh until you cry....over and over. There's onescene where Elf and a gruffy fellow warehouse worker(who was a totalstranger just a few moments before) are sitting on a pallet aftersmoking some dope, and are laughing really hard about something reallystupid, and the Elf leans over and begins tickling the guy under thearms and shouting "Tickle, Tickle!" as they both topple over inhysteric ecstasy....and I thought I was going to have a coronary, Ilaughed so long and hard (after running the DVD back to watch the samescene about 5 times over!!!!! This is absolutely my favorite all-timecomedy! I'm very hard to please when it comes to comedies, seeing mostof them as just stupid, but Elf is in a class by itself.
