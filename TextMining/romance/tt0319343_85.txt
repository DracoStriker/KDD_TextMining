Elf is essentially a Christmas classic nowadays, and for good reason.This movie is funny, sweet, and extremely quotable. The film followsBuddy the elf on his quest to NYC to find his birth father. It's aridiculous concept executed very well. Buddy encounters many crazycharacters and situations on his journey. He discovers the wildness ofNew York as he tries to adjust to life as a human.Will Ferrell makes a hilarious Buddy. His random screams of excitementand childlike joy make for a lovable protagonist. He is full ofinnocence and Christmas joy, making him someone you can root for andcare about. I love this film since I grew up watching it and it still holds aspecial place in my heart. I make sure to re-watch it every year aroundChristmas!
