I remember watching this Christmas film as a child. I just watched itrecently and I can still say that it still has the humor, spirit, andcharm that it did in my childhood. Unlike a lot of bad and unfunnycomedy films. Elf has the proper pacing, charm, and wit to make thisfilm funny. Our lead character Buddy the Elf is a very likable but onthe down side a bit cringy at times. In the film the papa elf tellsBuddy the shocking truth about who his real father is and then Buddytravels along way from the north pole to new York to meet his Dad.Buddy thinking he's a Christmas elf has an adventure in the dullbustling city of new York. Every bit of his adventures in New York iscute, charming, and laughably funny. Our other two characters Michaland Walter Hobs seem fairly unlikable at first but as they start todevelop they become likable character as the senses go on. My favoritepart of this film was getting Santa's slay to fly by trying to get thepeople of new York and the audience to have Christmas spirit.Inconclusion this film was great and has the Christmas charm for thewhole family to watch.
