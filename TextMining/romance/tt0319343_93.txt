I thought this movie was really good. It's funny, it's light, it'scarefree and simple. It's a movie the whole family can enjoy.This movie is about Buddy. He was a baby in an orphanage and onChristmas Eve, when Santa came, he sneaked his way into Santa's sack oftoys and ended going to the North Pole with him. An elf adopted him andcared for him as if he were his own. When Buddy grew up, he never knewwhy he was so big compared the other children. One day, when he was anadult, they told him that he isn't an elf. Buddy was surprisingly okaywith it, and set off to New York City to find his birth Dad. Once hedoes, he tries so hard to get his Dad to like him, but nothing worked.Eventually, Buddy had to stay with his Dad and his Dad's wife and kids.Buddy met a beautiful girl who worked in a department store. Buddy setup all Christmas decorations, as an elf would do. Eventually, his Dadbelieves him when he says for the umpteenth time that he's an elf. Andeverything works out.Recommended for: Families and children.Do they say the title of the movie, in the movie: Yes.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is:Awesome.
