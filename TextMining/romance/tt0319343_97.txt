occasionally hilarious Christmas movie...loaded with raucous slapstick,well performed.we all know "where it's going" from the gitgo and Will Ferrell is up tothe task. some of us were raised by wolves...well , Will was raised byElves...or by Santa...not sure.yes, it turns out he's the biological/full grown pixie son of JamesCaan, a struggling to stay afloat New York Publishing exec. he needs asure winner by DEc. 24th or it's the unemployment line on the 26th.will Ferrell just expedite that trip? picture runs a littlelong...Caan...is it me? he's just not engaged. maybe TIm Allen shouldhave played the Dad. he's not extra animated either, but we *expect*that of him. who knows if Caan intentionally held back to let Ferrelldominate the show? I liked Caan in HONEYMOON IN VEGAS...he should havebrought that kind of energy top this flick.absolutely fabulous, breathtaking special effects!
