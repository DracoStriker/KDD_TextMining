I went to see this film with my sister and my Mum and we were the onlyones in the cinema. Not the best start, but I continued to watch itanyway and am so glad I did. This is probably one of the most beautifuland romantic films I have ever seen! From the relationship of the twocharacters to their surroundings, every scene is breathtaking! TheNotebook tells the story of a summer romance that turns into a romancenever to be forgotten. Allie and Noah are the two lead characters andthey are wonderful. You immediately fall in love with the charactersand you want to follow every step of their doomed love story. it is oneof the greatest love stories ever told. Look out for the lake scene,unbelievable! I came out of the cinema wanting to go back in again andwatch it all over again. It feels like you are reading a diary watchingthis film, thats how detailed and wonderful this film is. Cannot reallygive too much away about the story, all I can say is if you haven'tseen this film yet, be sure to see it. I cannot think of a film moreperfect for Valentines Day!
