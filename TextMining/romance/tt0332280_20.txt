Why this movie is rated so high is beyond me. Don't get me wrong: I'm agirl, love Ryan Gosling and was pretty much excited about watching themovie. Unfortunately, when this torture finally finished after two longand excruciating hours, I just couldn't help to think that this must'vebeen the corniest piece of trash in the history of movie making. Thelead actors in my opinion had zero chemistry, and Ryan Gosling reallydisappointed me as Noah. The diversity of facial expressions wasbasically nonexistent and the acting was bad. And what's up with thecharacter of Noah? Was he supposed to act and sound like a psycho?Cause if he was, they did a hell of a job. Rachel McAdams was reallypretty, and that's basically it. And the ending... Oh, the ending! Itwas so lame and unrealistic it made me gag. What's heartbreaking andsad about it is a mystery to me. I don't know, maybe I just can't seethe grandness of The Notebook, but I certainly don't wish to comeacross it again.
