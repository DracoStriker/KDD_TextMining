Yet another movie that was made by people who think just because thereare people who kiss on screen it makes the movie emotional or romantic!The whole movie is based on a very thin principle, going back and forthbetween two periods in the life of two lovers without any real heartbehind it.I think with a different cast it would have been mildly interesting...MILDLY but it doesn't even come close to elliciting any of theemotional response you might expect from a good movie.The plot goes from one twist to another without any other purpose thanto surprise especially naive viewers and the tear jerker ending is abig yawn, even with the talent of poor Rowland and Garner who arecompletely wasted on the flat dialog and cliché storyline.The whole thing probably isn't helped by Gosling and McAdams TOTAL lackof chemistry and forced acting but I can't say it would have improvedthe poor plot any if the young actors had been even remotely close tothe talent of their eldest.If you're expecting a real romantic movie like Casablanca or NowVoyager, watch something else.
