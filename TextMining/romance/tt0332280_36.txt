From the moment of the opening credits you know this is going to be aslooooowwwww film, and it doesn't disappoint. But that's about the onlyway it doesn't disappoint. It has just about every "first love" moviecliché you can possibly think of, and has nothing new to add to them.Unlike Jack & Rose in Titanic, you have absolutely no empathy for thecharacters, and there seems to be no good reason for their lives tohave crossed. The two main characters keep swapping personality traitsthroughout the film. First one is weak, the other strong. The nextscene it's the other way around. A lot of their social behaviour iscompletely anachronistic.Couldn't wait for the film to end. It almost (but not quite) made AIseem short!
