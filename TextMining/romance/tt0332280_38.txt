A film so sweet, I went into a diabetic coma from watching it. True, Ididn't have any high expectations but I rented it nonetheless, simplyto see how bad it really was. Seeing a girl whine and bitch about howshe isn't allowed to do anything because of her parents is annoying andpathetic enough but when it involves a boarding school that's preparingone for an Ivy League college, this just reaches new levels ofignorance. The theme of finding a true love after spending yearsshitting your pants and forgetting the names of all those you everloved except for one stands out as a selfish and sappy moment not tomention the repulsive character Noah dangling himself from a FerrisWheel to get the girl to go out with him shows desperation beyondanything even I would try.
