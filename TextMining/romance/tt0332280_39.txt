Don't you wish you, an ordinary but having some romantic ideas teenageboy, get to meet with a rich and innocent beautiful young lady and getto have some amazing love story with her just because you areobsessed?! Yep, every teenager's dream. Now as I turned older, watchingthis movie again is just torturing.The story is unrealistic, the characters are completely boring and lackof anything special to remember. It feels like just a bunch of normalpeople who are thrown into a overly dramatized world. This is likewatching a movie that some dude become president of the US when hewakes up one morning - perhaps entertaining at the time when you havevery little real life experience.We need to stop making movies like this and make more movies thateither have more characteristic people and believable storyline or amovie that is about normal people and their realistic drama in life.
