This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not oneof those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantlywritten intriguing story about two young lovers that most people canrelate to.Even most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings.Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movieto be one of the best I've seen. I got to know both main characters andfound myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our firstlove and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes usthink of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaningof true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.
