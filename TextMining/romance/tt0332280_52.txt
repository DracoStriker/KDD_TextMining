OK, when you haven't read the book, it must be the most amazing movieever, but for me, it was really disappointing to watch. when I wasabout 10, I read this book, and I LOVED it (despite the love partsthing). But anyway, the book was really inspiring. I cannot believethis movie had a high rating when it the book was much better than themovie. Plus, the book shows much more emphasis on how the two actuallyloved each other. The movie was just too dull for me compared to thebook. My advice is, read the book first than watch this movie if youhaven't. The book is the most touching love story I have read.some corrections that I want to say: this movie sort of showed twoyoung lovers who just ran away, and just got lucky with theirrelationship. It actually makes the movie look bad!!!! first of all, itshould have showed how much deeper their love is than making out andstuff that made themselves attracted to each other. If their love isthat shallow, it just shows some madly in love teenagers who wouldbreak up eventually. Plus, there were a lot of scenes that was totallydifferent from the book. when they make book movies, they must showwhat the person is thinking even though they can't exactly blurt itout, since it is a film. well, it will be more difficult to do this,but they have to find a way, because everything comes out differentlywhen it is just acting.
