"The Notebook" is a story everyone in the world has heard a milliontimes before; young Romeo-and-Juliet summer love which is tossed andturned continuously by opposing outside forces. We've read it a hundredtimes before we start the first chapter, know the conclusion before wesee the end of the film, and can relate it to so many moments from thepast relationships of our lives.But what makes this film different from others is one main thing;beauty.Never before have I been moved this emotionally by a romance. From themoment is starts, you get sucked right in. You're totally involved inin these characters and unlike many romantic films I've watched, youactually care about what happens. The love between Allie and Noah is sopassionate and so vivid yet real and universal for any age. Any viewerwill stay connected with the story for the film's length and will bemoved long after the credits stop rolling.No matter how many times you've seen movies with the exact same plot, Ipromise you you'll appreciate every second of "The Notebook". I thinkthe world could use a few more movies like this. It truly shows thatlove bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, andendures all things. Just beautiful.
