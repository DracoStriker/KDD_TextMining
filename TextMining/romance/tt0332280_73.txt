This movie made me remember the movie "Lake House". Both are romanticbut this one is a little bit dramatic for older watchers. I think alllake houses have a romantic side. Actually this movie has two differentpoint of views, for both young and old watchers. The 40 and 50's styleof life in USA is quite well done with fantastic scenes. And you canrealize not only how appearance change by time and also how people liveand think. I was expecting a better end but again I am sure mostwatchers loves the end. But still I am not sure it is a good end orbad.. Briefly, If you liked "Lake House" I am sure you will love thismovie, too. Everyone should see it.
