Ryan Gosling is far too good an actor for this mawkish rubbish aboutyoung love and old love and eternal love. I knew things were bad when Istarted admiring the ducks on the lake. Gosling is the boy from thewrong side of the tracks who has a summer romance with rich girl RachelMcAdams, (who has the kind of face you are unlikely to remember fromone movie to the next). They lose each other and just as predictablyfind each other again and all the time nice old codger James Garnertells the story of their 'great' love to Gena Rowlands who has seniledementia. No brownie points for filling in the gaps.Rowlands is sensational considering she doesn't have anything to do butlook vacant and Joan Allen is simply brilliant as McAdams' rich bitchof a mother. The fact that Allen is one of the best actresses inAmerica helps. She can rise above the most mediocre of material andthis is truly mediocre; appallingly scripted, indifferently directedand if a few members of the cast are giving it more than it's worth,they can still hardly be said to be redeeming the material.
