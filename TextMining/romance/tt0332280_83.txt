I haven't cried so much from a movie until I saw this one.Drama..Romance..a little bit of subtle comedy..I felt like I was partof the movie..I felt like I could be watching a movie about me! Ifigured right from the start that the old couple were probably theyoung children in the story. The movie outline was very interesting.I've never seen a well played movie within a movie.Some part that agitated me was when the movie was getting good but thenthey would cut back to present day! I mean that was the point of themovie to keep it suspenseful like but here I am crying my eyes outwanting to find out more!! I was very disturbed with Allie, as an olderwomen, having that memory problem because that just isn't how I wouldpicture a love story. Felt really bad for her husband but give himprops for still loving and wanting to be with her.I was very surprised seeing Rachel McAdams playing Allie after seeingher in previous teen movies "Hot Chick" and "Mean girls", but heracting in this movie was pretty phenomenal. And Ryan Gosling...verygood looking actor who played his character well.I think, though, that they caught Allie's and Noah's stories shorttowards the ending. I would have loved to watched more about theirfuture. Ending was a little bit weird for me but made sense.Recommended: People who enjoy love stories.
