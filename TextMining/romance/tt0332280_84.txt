This is a good movie, don't get me wrong. But its not sad because itsromantic. Its sad because the end of the movie revolved around watchingolder people's lives fall apart. I'm sure anyone who has parents canrelate to the fear of knowing they have fewer days ahead then they havebehind. Now take some people in their later years and show their livesfalling apart, well of course people are going to cry. Its a terriblething. Tacking on flashbacks full of a moderately interesting lovestory is just a con into making people think this is one of the mostromantic movie of all time. It is romantic, but so are lots of othermovies. THIS movie just wanted to make you cry. So I'd compare it towatching a love story, then showing someone drown a bag of puppies.That would be sad too.r
