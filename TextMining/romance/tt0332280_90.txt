It's my film of the year so far. Forget about the clichés, theseagulls, Allie the elder's tasteful turnout etc, this is a first classlove story. The mix of the present and the past was exceptional, Noahand Allie present and past was acted very convincingly. An exploration of senile dementia and the test to see if real love canbreak the barriers that medicine can't. Can a teenage summer romancelast a lifetime? I thought the scene where Noah's girlfriend comes to visit was verywell done, even though later on Allie's fickleness is a bit upsetting.And while you know or think you can guess how it will end there are afew subtle slight swerves to keep you guessing. Will Allie have anaccident, who is the old guy Duke, Noah or Lon? And Gena Rowlands wasfantastic as the Allie the elder, I almost fell in love with her myselfand I am 30 years younger. Definitely worth the $10 entry fee and ifyou see it on DVD cuddle up with your other half and be prepared forthe sniffles cause it's touching if you have a heart.
