This movie is highly overrated, and Allie is pure trash. She was with akid for a month, went on with her life for like 10 years. She metanother guy, was with him for years and engaged, for then to run off toboink the other guy and slut herself. How is that romantic? It was sucha non-romantic way to play the movie. She could've met him again,feelings arising, for then to decide and break it off, for she goes onto shagging the guy. What the ...The Notebook is only a bit romantic when you isolate events. As awhole, Allie is pure trash. Even as an adult she commits disgustingadultery.
