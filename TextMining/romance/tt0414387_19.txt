No one go see Pride & Prejudice. It is the most wretched, boring,miserable movie I have seen all year. Keira Knightley does not look oract the part (note how she chooses to act with her chin every time shegets emphatic) and I've sold lumber more charismatic and interestingthan the man who plays Mr. Darcy. There are so many clichéd shots (if Iever have to see someone stare at a candle in the foreground for anentire shot while having a conversation, and then blow it out for thescene change, or a door slamming shut with a dull, resounding crashdirectly into the camera, I may scream.)Darcy is boring; Collins is boring; Bingley looks like a woman; Mrs.Bennett is not funny as she is in the BBC version, she is merelyirritating. And oh the giggling. The horrid, horrid giggling. I think agood 15 minutes of this movie is comprised of giggling. Another 15 goesto "moving" shots of the beautiful landscape, while Lizzie starespensively into the distance.I offer this as an especial warning to anyone who has not read thenovel, who would be doing themselves a horrible disservice by seeingthe movie before reading the book and watching the delightful ColinFirth BBC version - which is in every imaginable way a superior film tothis sack of sugary rubbish. Thank you. It felt good to get that out of my system. Please take myadvice. For your sakes.
