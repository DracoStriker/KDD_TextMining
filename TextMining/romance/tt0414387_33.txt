I have given this film a score of 2, one point due to the lovelyscenery, the other for the actors who worked well enough with thescript they were offered.Overall this film was a debacle. Perhaps it should have been called 'Afilm loosely based on a book by some woman of no great note' for allthe credit the scriptwriters gave Jane Austen. Fans of Austen, saveyour money and watch the BBC version again (Firth etc). I believe ittruly an insult to one of the greatest authors of history to dismemberher story, words, settings and even delete all wit from one of the mostperfect love stories, and observances of manner and class, of all time, Even the costuming is a disaster, the wigs awful, and where were halfthe characters? One begins to suspect they had a very small budgetafter paying Keira's fee, or perhaps it was all spent on hiring therocks who really stole the show (even though Elizabeth and herrelatives are supposed to be headed for the lakes district). I am soappalled by the 'movie machine' these days, and scriptwriters pleaseget over yourselves. you will never ever compare to the true literarygreats.To all those who have never heard of Jane Austen, you may well enjoythis film and go see it by all means.I am so, so sorely disappointed.
