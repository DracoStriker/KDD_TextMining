Some people say that we have to see this new adaptation with an openmind and that we should not compare this to that of the previousadaptations but why not? We could still compare the performances ofeach character couldn't we. It all comes down to how well eachcharacter acted their part. I don't believe that we should disregardthe brilliance of the previous adaptation to appreciate a new one.Tenyears ago I compared the 1995 BBC film to the earlier interpretationsof PnP and it just blew me away. It was a perfect interpretation andColin Firth as Mr Darcy is spot on.Watching the series made me read thebook and until now It still affects me every time I watch it. MathewMacfadden is not Mr Darcy , he is too crumpled and too soft to be MrDarcy.He is not proud enough and Keira is not strong enough to be anintelligent Lizzie. The whole film is just not PnP. The main charactersare almost in love too soon, they both don't have strong charactersthat made Lizzy and Darcy so perfect for each other. As a movie it isokay but not a definitive interpretation.
