I was extremely disappointed with this version of P&P, the producersreally couldn't have picked a worse actress to play the role of Lizzy.Elizabeth Bennett is the most sensible of all the sisters, yet Keiraattempted to play her as she does all her other characters - cute andsilly, it DID NOT work. Even the costumes seemed out of place on heranorexic frame, could they not at least have given her a wonder-bra, oreven some socks?Darcy came across more as a sulky teenager than an English Gentlemanand MacFadyen does not possess the same air of dignity and grace thatis Colin Firth. In the true story, Elizabeth's love for Darcy developedso gradually, yet here it progressed too quickly and therefore spoiltthe whole general feeling and suspense of the story. The filmaltogether was rushed through at an alarming pace without the viewerever really getting to know a character, and the whole 'Lydia saga'seemed to be resolved and forgotten in a matter of hours. The language jumped and interchanged from the original script to modernEnglish, even during the same conversations, resulting in a veryconfusing mess. This was especially apparent in the first proposal fromDarcy, which was so cringe-worthy I could barely stop myself fromcovering my ears and running out of the cinema.This film was cast, produced and directed so poorly, I beg everyone toread the book or watch the original in order to enjoy this fabulousstory and leave this pure Americanised trash where it belongs.
