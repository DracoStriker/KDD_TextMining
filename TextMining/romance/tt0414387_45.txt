If you have not seen the original b+w version or the masterpiece thatis the BBC mini-series you may very well enjoy this latest attempt tomake Pride and Prejudice. Though exited to see this well receivedmovie, upon watching I found myself very disappointed as I found themovie to be hap-hazard and sophomoric. There were many good actorsthrough out and I fault none of them as the acting can only go as faras the director is willing or able to take it. This director seemedbarely to understand the material or the time and place for which thetail is set. For my money, this movie was a dreadful mistake that onlywets the appetite for the quality of storytelling that Austin'smasterful and rich tale deserves. If one were to focus on this moviesmost obvious and glaring flaw it would be its abandonment of the rollof manners that colored every aspect of late 18th Century interactionand conversation. Such breeches of ethics and good manners such asgetting caught ease dropping (a sophomoric 'joke' used several times inthis film) would have devastated all involved. If you want to see whatI mean, see the above mentioned mini-series for all the examples youcould ever need.
