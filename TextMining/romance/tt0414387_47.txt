Allow me to preface by saying that before viewing this version of Prideand Prejudice I carried very high standards due to my love of the novelas well as the spectacular BBC mini series. Nevertheless, I could nothelp but be mortified at this effort of butchering a classic. Otherthan the cringe-worthy portrayal of Mr. Darcy by Matthew MacFadyan, theacting was actually commendable. The actors were simply victims of ascript that had an incredibly fast pace and had the nerve to alter thephrasing of Austen for a 21st century audience. I was disappointed onevery occasion as I awaited one of the novel's unforgettable lines. Therelationship between Mr and Mrs Bennet was also a total mystery, as thelay viewer would assume they had an amiable relationship when in truthAusten portrayed them as being largely estranged. Probably my biggestdisappointment was the mangling of epic scenes such as Darcy's initialproposal to Elizabeth and Lady Catherine's confrontation of Elizabeth,both of which could have been pivotal in the movie's success. For thoseof you who enjoyed this film, I beg you to watch the 1995 mini-seriesand in turn give this monstrous effort the contempt it deserves.
