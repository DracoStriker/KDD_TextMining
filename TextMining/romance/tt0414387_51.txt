It takes a lot of effort and determination to turn Austen's superbnovel into something truly awful. The producers, writers, director, andcast of PP2005 have managed to do just that. If you cherish the novel,don't go see this movie. If you love movies, give this one a miss. Ifyou're feeling optimistic about the state of the arts in our time, gosee this movie - you'll be cured of your optimism for a long time tocome. When I had finished watching this movie I felt like undergoingritual flagellation.I couldn't find a single thing to like about this movie. It'scompletely over the top. From the ball, where a few fiddlers andflutists manage to sound like an 80 piece orchestra, to Blethyn'stedious and patented hysterical mother, to Dench's absurd Lady deBourgh, to the hysteria of the five sisters, to earsplitting cacophonyof the five Bennett sisters in full cackle, to Knightly's vacuous face,to . . . words fail me.I'd give the movie a zero if I could. Pace, Miss Austen; this too willpass.
