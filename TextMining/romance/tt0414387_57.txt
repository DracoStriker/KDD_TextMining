I saw this at the Toronto Inter. Film Festival. At first I thought,"why yet another Pride and Prejudice?" But I quickly changed my mind.Yes, the 1995 version was wonderful, and yes, you can developcharacters a lot more in a miniseries. Let it go and judge this on itsown terms.This version is set earlier--1797. As the director explained, hethought the Empire dresses too ugly and justified the earlier datebecause that was the date of the first draft of P&P. So it looks a bitdifferent--more realistic, if you ask me. The Bennetts live in a realestate, with pigs and mud around. Chatsworth, which Jane Austenvisited, fills in for Pemberley. With the exception of the ball scenesand a scene in town, very little of the epic period piece is needed.Keira makes a wonderful Elizabeth. She is the right age to be vivaciousand silly, and she does a great job. Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett!!At first the idea seems preposterous, but once again, it turns outwell. Sutherland somehow masks his accent and blends in perfectly. Hiseccentricity is just enough to show where Elizabeth gets her spirit.The director and Matthew MacFadyen confessed at the screening thatneither had seen the earlier versions before they filmed this, whichperhaps explains why this is so successful--they weren't intimidatedand weren't tied to earlier interpretations.If you have any doubts, see this yourself. You won't be sorry.
