I just wanted to say that for those of you who weren't already aware,this version of Pride and Prejudice is mostly an art film. I went tosee it expecting for them to focus on things like telling the story andusing the witty dialouge to its utmost, and was shocked to discoverthat it wasn't about the story at all. The story is a backdrop in thiscase, used to give visual imagery to an art film. If you're goingexpecting something very different, hopefully this will help you not tobe disappointed. There is no comparing this version of Pride andPrejudice to any other, because it is an entirely different creature.Actors cannot be compared to other actors because this version is goingfor an entirely different feel. Keira and Matthew are not evenattempting to imitate Jennifer and Colin's performance. All comparisonis moot. In this version you are not supposed to be able to becomeattached to the characters, be amazed by how witty the dialouge sounds,or be enchanted with the story. These all have a very rushed andglossed over feeling because the main thing here is the visual medium.It is an art film called Pride and Prejudice. All other resemblance toJane Austen's book or previous adaptations is non existent. That beingsaid Keira Knightly is beautiful and Mr. Collins painfully amusing andcreepy. There is a lot of beautiful camera work and a lot of awkwardmoments. It's worth seeing to form your own opinion but be prepared forwhat to expect.
