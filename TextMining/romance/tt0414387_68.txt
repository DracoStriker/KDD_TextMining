Although I rarely give out excellent scores for movies, Pride &Prejudice of 2005 seems to demand one. Whatever flaws do exist in thefilm aren't even noticeable, and once you're swept into the magic ofthe story the spell is not broken for one moment until the televisionis turned off.The true surprise of this movie, for me anyway, was Matthew MacFadyen'sexcellent portrayal of Fitzwilliam Darcy. I am a huge fan of JaneAusten's book, and Colin Firth's Darcy (although momentous in its ownways) never quite seemed to match the written account to me. MacFadyentriumphs in bringing out the vulnerability that feeds the shell ofpride and his awkward shyness that lurks beyond his disdainful haughtybrow. His hesitation when it comes to sharing his feelings with LizzieBennet are exactly what I pictured from the book: an almost boyful andyouthful embarrassment paired with the desire and strength of a man. Hetruly shone.Keira Knightley was also superb. If you believed her career wasstereotyped by her work in Pirates of the Carribbean, one glance atthis film should prove you wrong. She has an incredible talent to playmany different roles and to bring out many different moves. The happy,carefree Elizabeth that is by shades overcome with sorrow and regret iswonderfully brought to life by Knightley.The other actresses and actors in this movie are quite excellent,especially Simon Woods, whom I had not heard of before. Something thatmakes Pride & Prejudice a treat for the eye is the delightful filming,which whirls you throughout ballrooms and across entry halls and fromconversation to conversation, dance to dance, without you even noticingthat you aren't there yourself.The raw desire that makes the ending so satisfactory is something thatis rarely found in a PG movie, but here it is pulled off with perfectdecency just in the eyes of Darcy and Lizzie. I definitely suggestgiving Pride & Prejudice a try.
