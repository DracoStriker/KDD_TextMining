I felt distracted by the 'realism' of the film. Jane Austen would nothave gone into detail about the 'farm' (chickens, hogs, etc.) portrayedin the film. Jane Austen's world was a gentle one and the Bennets,despite their pretensions, were middle class. The television series gotit right. This film did not. The new film deviated too far from thebook and the author's intent in dealing with the manners of theaspiring middle class in the early nineteenth century. Although thecostumes appeared to be authentic, the makeup was too heavy; theeyebrows on the women too sculptured and the men's beard too unshaven,as are characteristic in 2005. One good feature was the variety ofclothing styles form the current (early 1800s) to the outdated of JudiDench and Donald Sutherland. I remember David Maclean saying about thefilm Dr. Zhivago that they forgot about the hairstyles. Here theyforgot about the makeup.
