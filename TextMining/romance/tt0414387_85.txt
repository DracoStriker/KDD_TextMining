Keira Knightley is just plain horrible as Elizabeth. Yes, she's prettybut her Elizabeth struck me as shallow, silly and selfish. I never oncebelieved she was someone Darcy would be "bewitched" by. I couldn't waitfor the movie to end. I started seriously checking my watch at aboutthe one hour and twenty minute mark. Beautiful footage of thecountryside is not enough to carry a film. Too bad. This is usuallysuch a great story. I would like to see Matthew MacFadyen in somethingelse though. He looks like he might be interesting. Anyone have anysuggestions? As for the Americanized ending - I'd hardly call itromantic. Awkward was more like it. Some things are better left to theimagination.
