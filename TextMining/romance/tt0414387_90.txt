I for one am also a fan of the original BBC drama, I also thought it'dbe a poor cousin to the splendid BBC version. I only went because i gotfree tickets from the National Trust (who supplied access to many ofthe buildings used in the shooting). But, I thought it was an excellentadaptation. It is indeed hard to fit all the nuances of a classic novelin two hours, but i thought they did exceptionally well with this hardtask. I thought nearly all the actors did a fine job. Kiera excelled myexpectations of her, and take no notice of previous comments on MatthewMcFadden's role, I thought he handled it with aplomb. Brenda andDonalds pairing was inspired and both revelled in their respectiveroles. I took my wife to see this and she gave it ten out of ten. Itcertainly will wake the romantic in you (if there is one to be woken)Recommended.
