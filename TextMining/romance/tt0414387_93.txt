I'm afraid I didn't make it through the first half-hour of this film.Sadly, none of the satire, irony and characterisation that is presentin the book and the 1995 adaptation was present.The humour was simple. I was appalled by the portrayal of Bingley;making 'cheap' situation jokes which were not in the book. Bingley wastoo nice, not stupid. A group of young teenagers who were sittingbehind me found it highly amusing, so I must deduce that they havenever read the book.I couldn't stand Mr Bennet, he is not as quick witted as he was in thebook, and his deep monotonous voice began to grate.I thought Mr Collins was rather good.Kitty and Lydia were spot on.Keira Knightly smiled far too much and I began to grow sick of hercheesy teethy grin.I won't get started on Darcy, all I can say is that I didn't fancy him;enough said.The scenes were very nice, although the Bennets never cooked their ownmeals. In fact, Mrs Bennet makes a point of it. I'm also sure that theywere not farmers... not very 'gentlemanly'.Massive fans of the book and the 1995 adaptation will not like thisfilm and I would strongly suggest that you resist the temptation to seeit at the cinema and rent it out on DVD.I think it was a good way to get our money calling the film 'Pride &Prejudice', as it has little semblance of the true essence of the book.
