'Tulip Fever' transforms a promising idea into Dutch farce as itsscript heaps unnecessary complications onto a tale of maritalinfidelity in 17th century Amsterdam. The film opens with beautifulpenniless Sophia being married off to a wealthy middle-aged merchantwho desires a male heir. After three years have passed and no child hasappeared, the merchant commissions a double portrait of himself and hisyoung wife for posterity.When Sophia unwisely falls for the debt-laden artist, everything seemsnicely set up for some intense domestic double-dealing, but directorChadwick drowns the narrative in a torrent of subplots. While Sophiacavorts with the artist in his garret, her maid has been dallying witha fishmonger in the scullery. Before too long, the lovers of bothmistress and servant are speculating in Holland's tulip-mania bubble toimprove their fortunes and romantic prospects. Meanwhile, the two womenhatch an implausible plan to deal with their own problems. As thescheming becomes increasingly absurd, the story falls apart and theactors lose faith in their characters. Long before the end, most of theaudience will have joined them, as the resolution to all the financialintrigues and amorous chicanery turns the final act into slapstickmelodrama.
