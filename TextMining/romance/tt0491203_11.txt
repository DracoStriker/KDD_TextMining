I had the privilege of seeing this film in preview in the famousTuschinski theatre in the heart of the canal district in Amsterdam.Having enjoyed the novel whilst living there in 2011, I have watched asit's release dates have been continually changed giving all the signsof a production in distress. Early rumours of poor test screenings canbe damaging whether true or not! Like another reviewer I found theopening narration at odds with the images and consequently confusing.The first 40 minutes edited in a pedestrian style merely to tick offnecessary plot points, and without any sensitivity to mood or place, soprevalent in the novel. Strangely, the movie seemed to be both full ofbeautiful 'pictures', historical detail, visual treats and mood, andyet at the same time, the continued use of one street set left itfeeling small and enclosed and almost like stage set. Little sense ofAmsterdam as a City State enjoying a glorious rise on the world stage.At that point (after 40 minutes) having laid out the plot points andestablished the characters, the film starts to build, thanks to thereal tension in the original story, a good script and some fineperformances. I got over a niggling feeling of disappointment at the'smallness' of the set production, and instead decided to enjoy theabundant visual detail and the way the story started to rip along.Ultimately the great story rose above the shaky first reel and theproduction design above its limited scale. I was with two friends whohadn't read the book, and we all three came to really enjoy the film,despite the confused and hurried beginnings. It deserves to rise aboveits production history and be widely seen and enjoyed. It doesn't quitereach the heights of the source material, but it's far from a failurewith much to enjoy.
