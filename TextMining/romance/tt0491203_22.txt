I almost skipped seeing this movie because of bad reviews, but I am soglad I went anyway. This is really an excellent film. I cannot see forthe life of me what the critics (both professional and ordinarymoviegoers like myself) are pissing and moaning about. The story movesalong quickly, with lots of fun twists and turns and lots ofinteresting characters who are established early and then return atsurprising moments. Lots of good steamy sex too, so stay away if youdon't like that. I read reviews about the weak acting?they are allwrong. Judy Dench totally nails her role. It seems I have to relearnthis lesson over and over: IGNORE THE CRITICS!
