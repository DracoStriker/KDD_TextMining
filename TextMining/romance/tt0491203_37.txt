Saw this film this past weekend. I had initially checked out reviewshere - which at the time were strongly biased to the negative. Havingnow seen the film I feel I was seriously misled. I went into the filmless positive than needed. This is an excellent historical drama. Atleast 8 stars, and I have given 10 stars. I left the film decided towrite this review to let others know that this is a decent film forentertainment, and for thinking. Well worth anyone's time.Some negative comments made were sufficient to create such a confusingimpression that they are inexplicable (imo) - examples: voice narrationmakes perfect sense, and there is nothing confusing about the initial45 minutes of plot. I could go on but that should be enough to indicatethat everyone should approach this film in a positive frame. If you areinto period dramas and history elegantly rendered, this film definitelydeserves your attention. Definitely deserves awards for costumes andsets Imo.As stated by some others, source material for this screenplay wasexcellent so the story is both compelling and unique. The production islush and beautifully realized. If you love period dramas, and good lovestories, this one will do just fine, with the added joy of being anhistorical drama fully realized taking place in Amsterdam (rather thanLondon). I found the tulip trade backstory fascinating.Performances all round are uniformly excellent as well. No complaints.Well done, All.
