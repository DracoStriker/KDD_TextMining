Oh, how the mighty had fallen for this nonsensical romance. Even thegreat actors and actresses such as Alicia Vikander, Judi Dench andChristoph Waltz couldn't save this historical period romance misfire.Even Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne is involved in another follow-upmisfire (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets). Perhaps there ismore to meet the wilted tulip in its detail; Talk about on its crappyFifty Shades of Grey-styled sex scenes between Vikander and DeHaanwhich NO ONE is buying it (not sexy and spicy) and probably thechemistry is very muddled and confusing at the same time. Even thescreenplay from the acclaimed screenwriter, Tom Stoppard is completelywasted.Making matters worst is the execution of the film which is messy andcrappy at the same time. Plus the dialogue and the performances islaughable and wooden. Truly this unfortunate misfire which anyone couldbe thinking that the film is Oscar-bait is not worthy of an Oscar andinstead serves as a big embarrassment to the cast but not AliciaVikander, Judi Dench and Christoph Waltz for there are somegood-quality films that are involved that can make them forget theirparticipation in this wilted movie mess and probably this terriblehistorical nonsense garbage is just added to the worst movies of 2017so far.
