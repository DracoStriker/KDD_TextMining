Tulipmania is one of Europe's weirder historical events. Unfortunately,the movie barely touches on the tulip market craze, except as a deus exmachina to bestow sudden wealth and/or loss on characters who we barelycare about and who do nothing to deserve it. The main problem with the film is that the love triangle that issupposed to be the main story appears out of nowhere -- one of thecharacters simply looks up pensively, as if he just solved a riddle,and declares, "I'm in love!" Up until that point, he had shared maybe60 seconds of screen time with the object of his affection. How can wecare about the contrived swings in fortune of such shallow people? Making things worse, this love triangle movie has five main characters,leading to underdeveloped characters, repetition of ideas andunnecessary subplots. I loved the sets and I thought that Christoph Waltz, Holliday Graingerand Jack O'Connell did great jobs with the little they had to workwith.
