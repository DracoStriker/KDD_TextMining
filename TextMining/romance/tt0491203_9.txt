Here is only one review of the 2014-version. Based on that review, itis fair to say that some of the plot holes have obviously been stuffed,while others are still wide open (or have been opened). I don't know ifthe holes have been faithfully adapted from the book or if they werespecifically designed for the film.In the 16th century there was a big economic bubble based on tuliponions. This is the background for a romance between a painter and amarried woman. They make out a plan to get rich fast, so that they canrun away to the East Indies. So far, so good. The point is now that thetwo strings never really are woven properly together. The developmentof the plot is, at best, sketchy. Character development, if any, israther rhapsodical. The lovers (Vikander and DeHaan) are not reallylikable. The script gives them zero personality and they compensate byoveracting. The only person carrying a bit of sympathy is the cheatedhusband (Waltz). On the other hand the makers strive to give usimpressions of street life then, raw, loud and rather vulgar it is intheir view. The final twist of the plot is surprising, but notconvincing. There are further things that were rather annoying in this film: Theuse of a narrator. It seemed that the makers didn't trust the force oftheir pictures and thought they had to spell it out for more distractedviewers. Shaky camera and fast clipping. I think it is a misconceptionto edit a costume drama to fit the taste of the MTV generation. (Makeit more like The Girl with a Pearl Earring!) One reason for historical fiction is to make us understand the burst ofthe recent economic bubble on the basis of a historical example. Themakers of this film didn't really succeed in doing that. The persons inthis film are far away and two-dimensional like drawings on a wall.Unless you write a review about them, you have already forgotten themtomorrow.
