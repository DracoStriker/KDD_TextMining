The film is a series of profound moral dilemmas?while contrived by theauthor, they are fair questions?that resonate deeply in the 21stCentury: The role of guilt in victims, perpetrators, individuals andcollectively, as well as justice, forgiveness, redemption, shame and,of course, literacy and its role in Western thought.All this is a pretty heady mix for a film, but Stephen Daldry (as with"The Hours" ) makes literary conceit play very naturally here. DavidHare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of the alwaysremarkable Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly,this is indeed rarefied film-making. But the actors are what drag the audience into this story. David Krossis amazing as the young Michael who has to play a range of virginalinnocent to wizened and bitter. It's the key role in the film, andwe're all lucky he was found to play this role. And the everconfounding Kate Winslet. What an amazing career for this youngactress! Running through a list of her credits, she has some of thebest performances of the last decade: "Holy Smoke," "EternalSunshine?," "Iris," "Finding Neverland," "Little Children." But hereshe does something very different. Playing what amounts to a monster,we see that they too are human. Not many actresses could bring thisoff, but it may be her greatest accomplishment to date. Ralph Fiennes brings a continuity to the work David Kross begins, andthere's a brief appearance by Lena Olin who commands the dignity therole deserves. I'm puzzled at the lukewarm reception to this film. I almost missedseeing it. And it turned out to be one of my favorite and the mostheart-rending films of the year. All involved should be very proud.
