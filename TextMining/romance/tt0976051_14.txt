Like all works of art that endeavor to "illuminate" the Holocaust, "TheReader" ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can befound. Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge theimpossibility of its task. Thus, rather than trying to resolve all theissues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trustingthat, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our ownconclusions about what, if anything, it all "means."Though it is set in a number of different time periods, the storyproper begins in 1958, when a 15-year-old German boy by the name ofMichael Berg is seduced by a 38-year-old woman named Hanna Schmitz. Fora summer, the two carry on a secret, illicit affair, wherein the womanintroduces the boy to the joys of physical love, while he reciprocatesby reading the classics to her between bouts of passionate lovemaking.Flash forward to 1966 when Michael, now a university law student,discovers, much to his horror, that this very same Hanna who meant somuch to him in his youth is actually a former concentration camp guardcurrently standing trial for war crimes. The story goes even furtherahead in time as a now middle-aged Michael keeps up the relationship bysending his personalized recordings of books to Hanna as she serves outher time in prison.There has been some criticism leveled against the film that it aims tocast a Nazi mass murderer in a "sympathetic" light. Yet, whatultimately comes across in the story is not how "likable" a personHanna is but how sadly tragic. Like all fine drama, "The Reader" goesbeyond the two-dimensional stereotypes of heroes and villains toexamine the complexity of human relationships and the messiness of thehuman condition. The movie keeps us emotionally off-balance throughout.Even in the early stages of the courtship, we are torn between ourattraction to the characters as individuals and our revulsion at thedifference in their ages. Hanna is particularly enigmatic as sheembraces a child two decades her junior yet seems to find some strangefulfillment in him that goes beyond the obvious physicality of theirrelationship. Despite the touchy nature of these scenes, we get a feelfor what brings these two very different characters together at thisparticular moment in time.As the story moves on, the screenplay confronts many of the thornierissues surrounding what exactly happened in Germany in the middle ofthe Twentieth Century, questioning how so many "average" people could,at best, have turned a blind eye to the events that were occurring,and, at worst, have allowed themselves to become complicit in the massatrocities. There's a beautifully incisive scene in which a young lawstudent confronts his professor, demanding to know how the man has beenable to live with himself for all these years, knowing that he did notdo everything within his power to try and stop what was happening. Inthat brief, shining moment, we get a sense of what it must have beenlike for the people in Germany in the decades following the war when somany, Hanna included, simply turned their backs on the past in aneffort to move on with their lives.Perhaps the most complex character in the story is Michael, who, as heages and learns more and more hidden truths about his first love, mustcome to terms with the fact that the woman he thought he knew on themost intimate of terms may, in fact, be an unrepentant mass murderer.Yet, love is not something that can be turned on and off at will, andit takes Michael decades to figure out just how best to deal with themoral dilemma raging in the very depths of his soul.Michael is played first by David Kross in the period from 1958 to 1966,and then by Ralph Fiennes in the time thereafter. Both are superb, withKross, in particular, delivering a performance of such delicacy andsensitivity that he sets the groundwork for what Fiennes is called onto do later in the film. And, of course, Kate Winslet, in the role thatwon her an Oscar, demonstrates yet again why she is one of the screen'sgreat actresses.Kudos must also go to screenwriter David Hare, who has adapted BernhardSchlink's complexly structured novel with integrity and taste, and todirector Stephen Daldry and cinematographers Chris Menges and RogerDeakins for the sumptuous look they have achieved with the film.Together, these fine artists have created a work that challenges theintellect and roils the emotions.
