Stephen Daldry hit the nail on the head for his interpretation of thenovel. His choice of location, cinematography and casting were spot on,which enabled him to deliver a well depicted version of the novel.Kate Winslet and David Kross were the backbone of the film, as theyportrayed Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz, respectively, as they werewritten in the novel. Ultimately, their chemistry and interplay wasparticularly electrifying and makes the audience really feel for theircharacters. Surprisingly, Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the older MichaelBerg was a major let down, as he did a poor job in emphasising the painand suffering that the character goes through.The court scene is another disappointment. Although it is depicted aswritten in the novel, the scene would have been strengthened if thefilm makers had shown flash backs of the events surrounding theHolocaust, which was the major event of this film.The film is worth watching, but it is no masterpiece.
