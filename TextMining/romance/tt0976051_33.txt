Diane and I watched this moving, confronting film yesterday and we bothfelt its disturbing combination of innocent guilt (can there be such acontradiction of terms?) and commonplace evil. So much is illuminatedin the last part of the film; so many questions answered and so manymoral issues raised during the film's trial that a person like myselfleft the theatre with fascinating moral dilemmas jumping over eachother and made The Reader an extremely satisfying viewing experience.To me, the most memorable scene took place at the trial when theprosecutor asked Hanna (Kate Winslet) why she did not open the door ofthe burning church when she knew that a fire was sweeping through thebuilding. Hanna, when questioned by the trial judge and asked why shedid such a thing, replied that it was the proper thing to do; that shewas an SS guard and that to let the people out of the burning churchwould have meant chaos and as a guard she could not allow that tohappen. Hannah Arendt perfectly described the moral situation that theHanna of the movie found herself in and she described it as thebanality of evil. To quote her, "The sad truth is that most evil isdone by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil" andisn't this precisely the situation that Hanna Schmitz found herselfconfronting? After this startling revelation, the viewer must deal withthe confronting personal trauma faced by Fienne's character, MichaelBerg; should he tell the court of Hanna's illiteracy (a personalproblem she has lived with her entire life) or keep her secret and seeher spend her adult life behind bars while her fellow SS guardscontinue their lie and escape justice?The Reader is an intellectual, severe movie that people should seewithout fail.
