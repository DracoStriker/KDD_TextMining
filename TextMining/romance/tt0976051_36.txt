First off, let me start by saying I never read the book, or know itexisted before seeing this movie. I will comment on the title at theend of the review.The story of The Reader is a troubling but fascinating one. Even if youare very open-minded, the tough and sight of an intimate relationshipbetween a 15-years-old boy and a 35 years-old woman may disturb you. Iknow it did for me. But this uneasy feeling is what is good about themovie: it makes you think.The second part of the movie is more about the back-story of KateWinslet character in World War II. And this is here that the movieshows its biggest flaw: you have a hard time understanding theunderlying motivations of the characters. Not because their actionsdon't make sense, but because their motivations are so complex and outof the ordinary that you have a hard time deciphering them by seeingonly faces. This is why I think the book must be better: in a book, youcan inside the head of a character, which you can't do in a movie(Being John Malkovich aside) The actors must be praised for theirperformances nonetheless. Kate Winslet had a tough role and played itwith brio. She highly deserve her Golden Globe, and probably even anOscar. David Kross must also be praised because he had the toughestchallenge of all: you're first English-speaking role, you're not even18 and you must play in a sex scene with Kate Winslet? I know Iwouldn't be able.Ralph Fiennes, however, disappointed me. He seemed like a daydreamer,too soft-spoken, too slow. In contrast to his best-known role (AmonGoeth and Voldemort), he seemed extinguished.All in all, a good movie, with some flaws due to the nature of thestory. Go see the movie and, if you like it, seek the book, you maybeeven more satisfied.
