The main themes are about German guilt over WW2 and the Holocaust goingdown through the generations, so we flip about between the present and1958 and years in between. Everything is bound up with whether Germansof all generations can face up to what happened and what they did. So,after an hour of nude sex scenes between a young boy (15) representingthe postWar generation and a much older woman (about 36) who obviouslylived through the war (done before in so many films, eg Summer of 42,the Graduate etc) with the usual clichés of bathing scenes (to wash offguilt), she leaves suddenly - the result being a dysfunctionalcharacter (brilliantly acted as a young boy by Kross, but mournfullymiserable as usual by Ralph Fiennes) who has to find himself. But hefinds out that his one time lover was a Nazi Concentration Camp Guardwhen he attends a War Criminal trial. He is able to save her from along sentence and discusses it with his Law Professor, but that themedisappears. But he supports her in prison, but as she is about to leavehe manages to get her to face up to her guilt. Cue more guilt andtragedy, only to be cauterised by his being open with his daughter -the next generation (groan, groan). Yes, you guessed it - far toopleased with itself for its over literary adaptation, manneredstylistic approach, with metaphors for actions and guilt barelydisguised in everyday happenings. Kate Winslet looks suitably hauntedthough not old enough to look like Fiennes' mother! But it was a suckerfor Weinstein with Oscar written all over it!!!!! Some good acting butfar too pleased with its' own portentousness. And we did not need Katewith her kit off so often - not required for the storyline!
