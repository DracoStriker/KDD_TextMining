The Reader is quite a complex movie. One can call it a romantic-dramabut there are other complexities that make an interpretation of thiswork difficult.At the heart of these complexities is the protagonist Hanna Schmitzplayed by Kate Winslet. She lives in her own world and owninterpretations of things around her. She has a secret which she hasmanaged to hide throughout her professional career. This secret affectsa lot of things- including her romantic liaisons and her ignoringinhuman and dastardly ideologies and practices.A few other undertones are also present. Notably, the fact the peopleget attracted to those who seem to have what they themselves cannothave. This possibly explains 36 year old Hanna's affair with the 15year Michael, a student who can read! Although this decision, alongwith the other decisions she takes in her life, isn't the best one- thepoor introverted lad remains pained for the rest of his life.Perhaps that is what this fast paced and nicely edited movie intends toconvey- that while this character is indeed flawed; but so are life'smost general characters. This possibly explains the collective madnesspeople in different times and different places seem to go through.Although such characters may not deserve sympathy per se, they stilldeserve it simply by virtue of their being human beings. Milgramexperiment and 'Banality of Evil' also point in the same direction.And for the actors, it is actually the 18 year old David Kross, playingKate Winslet's young lover Michael Berg, who steals the show andimpresses one the most. Incidentally, Kross looks a cross betweenKeaneu Reeves and Heath Ledger. As for Kate Winslet, I'm not sure whatthe various judges saw in her performance(pun intended!) to hand overso many awards! I saw the move only once- may be I missed something...
