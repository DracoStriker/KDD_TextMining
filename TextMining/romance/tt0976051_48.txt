The Plot: Nearly ten years after he had an affair with her, MichaelBerg, a law student, sees Hannah Schmitts up on trial for being a Nazi.She is still in love with him ten years after the case. But Michael hasmoved on.Kate Winslet sure as hell deserved that Oscar. I never did seeRevolutionary road, but I bet she was better in this. When I heardabout Kate Winslet playing a Nazi, I thought "What the hell?" KateWinslet is British. What the hell is she doing playing a Nazi? anyways,Winslet is fantastic as Hannah Schmitts. I also liked David Kross asthe younger Michael. You didn't see much of Ralph Feines' Michael.That's why I mentioned David Kross. I think The Reader is somewhat sadin a way. Because of not having one ability, her life is ruined. Alsoyears after their affair she is still in love with him and he's movedon is kind of sad also. The Reader is a great film that deserved morecredit than it received. Though it received enough.
