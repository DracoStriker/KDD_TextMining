In 1995, in Berlim, the lawyer Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) recalls hisadolescence in 1958 in Newstadt, West Germany, when he was fifteenyears old (David Kross). While walking on the street, he becomes illand the thirty-six year-old stranger Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) helpshim to go home. Three months later, in summertime, he is recovered andhe pays a visit to Hanna to thank her kindness and they immediatelybegin a secret affair. Their encounters always begin with Michaelreading a book and then going to the bed with Hanna, until the dayHanna vanishes, leaving the teenager brokenhearted. In 1966, Michael isa law student of the Heidelberg Law School and his class goes to atrial of Nazi war crimes. For Michael's surprise, he finds that Hannawas a former S.S. concentration camp guard and is being accused in thecourtroom of several crimes. Michael lives a dilemma: should hedisclose a secret that may save Hanna from a life sentence?."The Reader" is a good movie, but never for an Oscar nomination. Thestory is predictable and falsely moralist with the despicable attitudeof Michael in court, hiding the secret that could have saved Hanna fromher most severe accusation. In my opinion, Kate Winslet is presentlyone of the best contemporary actresses after Meryl Streep, but shecould never win an Oscar performing a German character without speakingGerman. That is one of the major differences from a great number ofEuropeans and non-Europeans actors and actresses, the skill forlanguages.One exception is the fabulous Meryl Streep that not onlylearned a Polish accent but also learned how to speak German to make"Sophie's Choice". Kate Winslet deserves an Oscar for her magnificentfilmography, but never for "The Reader", which is another movie aboutthe Holocaust, the favorite theme for nomination in Hollywood. My voteis eight.Title (Brazil): "O Leitor" ("The Reader")
