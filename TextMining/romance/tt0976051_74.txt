That was so much better than I thought it would be.A bizarrely heart-warming, fairly-told, honest, cracked-heart alike,sensual, human story which represents the morality confusion peoplemeet along the journey of life. The phenomenal, charming, talented, passionate Kate Winslet haddelivered a spectacular performance. She is just a perfect descriptionof feminine confidence.Fiennes and Kross were pretty good, but I was so, SO imagining DiCapriofor the whole role.The music was perfectly suitable for the atmosphere.Pretty good screenplay and direction, yet I think they had a prettygood chance for squeezing more emotions of the sexual and painfulevents of the characters.
