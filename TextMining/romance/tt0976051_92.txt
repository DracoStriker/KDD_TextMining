I found the chance to watch this movie a year too late. But uponfinishing it, my mind was filled with many thoughts. i may not haveunderstood the movie fully but the issues brought center was powerful.to view a person's mind that is far from whats in front of her eyes,contradicting the typical action of a human..amazingly portrayed. i wasstunned watching the trial scene - when hanna said the guards wereresponsible for the prisoners thus letting them out would create chaosand its their job to keep the prisoners in order, even if it meanshaving the prisoners burnt alive inside a locked church. what does thatsay abt us? to me it means, the level of empathy we could have for aperson could be challenging. the different picture in every human'smind is so broad-ranging, influenced by the different named andun-named factors all around us. and none is to be judged by others, butone's self.
