I have to admit I avoided this movie, even avoiding a free screening.For some reason, I thought this was the cinematic equivalent of aHarlequin romance novel.Boy, was I wrong.Although there are some problems (the kid does not age well -- goingfrom an 18 year old actor to Ralph Fiennes in 8 years), it's afascinating movie. It puts you off balance through a great deal of it,and not always for the same reason.When one of the few negatives you can come up with is that you saw thesame car drive by in the background twice, it's a pretty damn goodmovie.
