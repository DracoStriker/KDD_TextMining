A very good somewhat subtle movie where almost everything is in theunsaid, the subtext and the eyes of the characters. The always sublimeKate Winslet did not get an academy award nomination for nothing. She'sbold enough to act without makeup, naked and at different ages. Theother actors were fine also (including Ralph Fiennes, excuse the badpun ;-). I wish it had been more touching for me but it's already greatthat the character played by Kate Winslet was multidimensional and notunlikeable despite her sins. Lest I forget, besides the "love" storyelement, there is a strong reflexion about morality, guilt and doingwhat's right. As a former and hopefully future bookseller/librarian,the reading parts of the story were some of the scenes I preferred.It's definitely worth a rental but probably not a purchase as watchingit once is probably enough.Rating: 7 out of 10
