I wish I could give this a 0 out of 10. Or maybe a -8000. StephenieMeyer is the worst freaking writer -ever-. She has no talent and this"movie" is a waste of money, time, and brain cells (if any were eveninvolved in its making/inception) -- as is the "book". The "book" -- Iuse that term loosely -- is fanfiction for something that doesn'texist, and Stephenie Meyer's pathetic attempts at writing should all be-burned-. She writes mindless trash that's better suited for her "dreamjournal" (said with as much disdain as possible), though for peoplewith taste and brain cells it would be more like a nightmare journal.Read something written by someone with a brain! Watch something thatisn't craaaaap!
