Now do not be offended by any of this, this is just my opinion.No I am not a rabid Twilight hater. I read the books, yes all of them.I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out,or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems withthis movie. It's not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did anexcellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was notreally who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bellaand Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for aheroine who isn't so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe avampire who isn't broody and boring and doesn't SPRAKLE! ((sorry thatjust bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to theactually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but itwould have at least gotten 5 stars from me.I do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as istated before the acting was not terrible. I would have pickeddifferent people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one morething to say before i end this.RABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIESERIES!! don't take the fact that people don't like it to heart. if youlike it, thats great.
