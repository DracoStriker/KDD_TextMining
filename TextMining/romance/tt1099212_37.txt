This movie was extremely disappointing. I've read all of the Twilighbooks at least twice and loved them so the problem for me was not inthe original plot or the characters, but I believe the producer,director, and the some actors left a lot to be desired. I realize thatno matter who they picked to act out the roles they would never lookexactly as they did in my mind but that is no excuse for the horribleacting that went into this movie. Some of the characters were great andtrue to form Alice, Jacob, Charlie, Renee, Bill, Carlisle, Emmet, andEsme, and the kids casted as Bella's classmates (jessica, mike etc..)all did a great job. But here lies the problem, all of those characterswere only in supporting roles during this movie. The actors casted asBella and Edward in my opinion looked like they didn't know what theywere doing, for most of the movie they just looked confused or awkward,in a packed movie theater it was sad to see how many people werelaughing during parts that were supposed to be sad or touching just atthe mere absurdity of it all, to top that off I didn't feel a greatamount of chemistry between Bella and Edward, even when she professedher love to him it seemed childish and kind of random. The specialeffects were also pretty bad, during the parts where they're supposedto be running really fast they only added a slight blur behind theactors and some cheesy sound effects that wouldn't have sounded out ofplace in a roadrunner cartoon, even the TV show Heroes does a betterjob at showing speed, I expected something a lot better from a movie.And all of this is aside from the fact that the movie wasn't reallytrue to the book on many aspects, but I came into the movie expectingthat. On a personal note I think the character that was worst castedwas Rosalie, Rosalie is supposed to be practically the essence offemale beauty, this girl had a butt-chin and in my (and my friends')opinion she was on the heavier side, not to say that she wasn't prettybecause that would be a lie, but i just don't think she quite reachedthe level that the real Rosalie was at, and I can think of many otheractresses that would have been better suited for the role.
