i wont comment on the book or compare anything to anything , but what iknow is that , in the first time of my life and am a film addict isleep through a movie in the cinema , it was like something u saw amillion times before and u know what is going to happen , so so boring, and the first time also i ask my husband to leave cuz i couldn't bearto stay any longer lol , despite it was the day we celebrated theopening of the new movie theater in my town and it was so nice andclean and close to my house , but the film corrupted all the excitementfor me , i'll give it one star only and i think this is to much for it.That is my opinion , maybe other people will like such a film but afterall the action we see in the cinema today , such a thriller is achildren's bed time story again one star is more than enough.
