I read the book and was so excited to see this movie, but was utterlydisappointed. With in the first ten minutes I wanted to get up andleave. The special effects were cheesy, the running scenes were notwhat I would have expected to see, and seemed more cheesy thanunreal.The characters never seemed to be natural they all seemed likethey were being forced to say what they were saying and just awkward towatch. Edward looked constipated through out the whole film and it wasjust uncomfortable to watch. It did follow the book's storyline verywell with some parts left out as usual, but the worst acting ever! Iwould not recommend seeing this movie, read the book instead.
