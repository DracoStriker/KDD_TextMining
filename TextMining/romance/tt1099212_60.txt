If you really wanna scare rogue nations, plunk a giant screen down intheir country from the sky and play this movie! I pride myself on beinga fairly big fan of cinema and have NEVER fallen asleep during amovie....until I saw this flick! Goofy metro sexual hair do's, a gangof pale faced uber vamp teeny clones....Now another problem. These vampkids are supposed to soooo old..How in the heck are they able to attendschool for all these years and no one realize they haven'tgraduated??!! I can't believe people fell for this. If you are going tohave a brooding vampire movie, have them brood for a halfway decentreason. Twilight fails because the story forces itself along.Christopher Lee could carry a vampire because he was able to stirfeelings and emotions of viewers. This movie doesn't because the talentlacks in that department....Sorely!!...But this is more due to trendriding than anything else. I think we are in overdose of the "malevampire falls in love with teeny bopper" story line right now.
