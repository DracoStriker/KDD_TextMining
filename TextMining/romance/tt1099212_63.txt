This movie actually made me feel like vomiting.Acting was terrible and I felt really embarrassed for them...Cringingevery time Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) said anything. I Hope I neverhave to watch her in a movie again....EVER!!!Girls, if you are crazy enough to like this movie. Don't make your manwatch it!!! He will HATE you for it and it will result in a massiveargument.I really feel like I wasted 122 minutes of my life when I pressed play.Actually I have to add on another 5 minutes where I had to work out howto use my grandmothers DVD player. So I actually wasted 127 minutes.This review took me around 15 minutes but I feel like I have justclaimed a bit of my life back by writing it.
