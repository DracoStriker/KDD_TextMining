I saw nothing good in this film, although I really did like the (first)book. The cinematography is what really struck me as terrible. I really don'tknow what they were trying to convey with it (an avant-gardeapproach?), but it didn't work for me and I found I couldn't move pastit. Perhaps, then, it tainted my opinion regarding the rest of thefilm, but I saw nothing good in it either; be it the soundtrack (poor),the dialogue/screenplay (lame) or the acting (overly hesitant attimes). Quite honestly, I saw none of the chemistry that others have commentedabout regarding the two main characters. Their relationship developedmuch too quickly and wasn't adequately explained. Most of the earlybook takes place in Bella's thoughts, and that wasn't translated intothe film. Edward went from apparently hating Bella to loving her almostovernight.We rented it through Netflix, and I am thankful for not having spentthe $$ to see it in the theater. I doubt I bother with the others whichare to (inevitably) follow.
