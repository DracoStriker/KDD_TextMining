Twilight. What can I say about Twilight? I'll begin on a positive note.The film used a good song, Supermassive Black Hole made famous by Muse.Twilight is what can only be described as a mess. It tells the story of17 year old Bella Swan, a teen who recently went to live with herfather in the rainy city of Forks, Washington. There she meets EdwardCullen, an unbearably beautiful vampire. The two fall for each other,but that's not the only force of attraction between them. Edwardthirsts for Bella's blood more than any other human's, which makes himespecially dangerous to Bella. Lucky for Bella, the Cullens don't drinkhuman blood, and Edward is strong-willed, as well as deeply in lovewith her. Along with this obsticale in the way of their love, a vampirenamed James wants her blood-and he won't give up.I must say, I am a fan of the books so this review is a tad biased.This Bella, played by Kristen Stewart, was not the Bella I know. TheBella I know is shy and not sure of herself. This Bella was tooconfident and sometimes came off as almost rude. Also, the Edward inthe film, played by Robert Pattinson, was not a perfect embodiment ofthe character. This Edward did things that the book character wouldnever have done.On a non-biased note, the film went much too fast. Twilight seemedrushed, and the scenes changed too quickly. There were also scenes thatjust had me laughing, although they were not meant to be humorous; acouple scenes were just altogether unnecessary.Overall, the movie was a poor interpretation of the book I love sodearly and just a poor film in general.
