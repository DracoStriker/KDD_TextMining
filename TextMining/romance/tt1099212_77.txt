This movie was complete crap. Most of the scenes that were shot gave mea headache. They needed to hold the camera STRAIGHT. My brother wastedtwenty bucks when we went to see this. He liked it though. I'm an avidreader of the books. (Read the first three in two weeks, and the fourthin a week.) I felt they butchered the books. Nothing was the same. Noteven when she told him her theories of the vampire in the car. Themeadow where everything started!? HORRIBLE. I HATED IT. Most of thepeople in the theater did. Catherine Hardwicke did a horrible job. Noneof the actors fit the roles. Especially Kirsten Stewart. She's NOTBella. Emily Browning was much more suited for the role. She speaksthrough her teeth, and her tone was monotone'd the WHOLE movie.Seriously. Don't waste your money.
