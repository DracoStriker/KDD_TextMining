OK, so from what I know about this movie, people either love it or hateit. The truth, of course, is somewhere in-between. While the movie isnot perfect, it is very good fun and delivers as long as you don'texpect a masterpiece. So don't raise the bar of your expectations toohigh - this is NOT going to be an Oscar winning masterpiece and it isNOT going to enter the IMDb Top 250.The story is simple - Bella Swan is a common girl which falls in lovewith the vampire Edward Cullen. Cullen's family are "vegetarians" -they drink only animal blood and do not attack humans. Then, however,are the "classic" vampires that would not hesitate to do it, and Edwardprotects Bella from them.I guess those who hate the movie do not know what a bad movie reallyis. You can call a movie bad when you regret that you watched it andwhen you feel that you have lost two hours without any good reason."Twilight" is not that kind of movie. It has a sense of direction andit is not just "flowing around" like other movies. Acting is prettydecent. Although I thought Kristen Stewart was an awful actress, RobertPattinson (Ed Cullen) and Cam Gigandet (James, the villain vampire)excel in their roles. Although the story is not one of the mostoriginal ones, it does not bore people and if you have nothing to do, Iwould recommend seeing "Twilight".Oh, and by the way, for all the girls who adore "Twilight", I guess Iget them. After all, Ed Cullen is good-looking, super-strong,super-fast, sensitive, who wouldn't like him?
