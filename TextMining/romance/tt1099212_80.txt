First of all I'd like to say that not many movies ever accomplish thedifficult task of doing their books justice, but this movie basicallymade the books look ridiculously lame and cheesy. Anyone who watchedthe movie first hoping for some insight to the books will NOT want toread the books afterwards because the love story seems sounrealistic..while the reason the books are so popular is because theySEEM like the love between Edward and Bella could actually happen inreal life! Until the baseball scene, there was really no action, andthe movie just kind of dragged along. Once the "bad" vampires came intoplay, things finally started to get interesting. I think they should'veincluded more action like this throughout the entire movie to keepviewers attention.
