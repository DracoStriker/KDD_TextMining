I have read the Twilight series from long before they were popular,when Twilight was just a standalone novel with a small but avid fanbase. When i heard Hollywood was making this into a movie i couldn'tdescribe how excited i was.What they released on screen makes me wish they would NEVER EVER dothis again. I'm sorry but at this point the fans should have some sayin the quality of acting, not to mention the special effects. Theacting between Edward and Bella was cringe worthy, and people wereactually laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny. Famouslines ("and so the lion fell in love with the lamb", etc) wereBUTCHERED, most of the time Edward just looked constipated and soundedwhiney instead of the brooding but in love vampire he's supposed to be,and don't even get me started about the ridiculousness of him runningup the tree with Bella or how he was supposed to sparkle in the sun.Had i not been a huge fan, this might not have been QUITE as bad, butwhat makes it worse is to know they followed the plot pretty well butstill failed that bad at having even an attempt at decent acting. Aliceand Jacob were probably the only two that had decent acting in thatwhole movie.All in all, i think this movie was just rushed through and the directorwas to worried about making it look artistic and poignant rather thanfocus on the basics, like acting and character interaction. Hell i'drather have less special effects in the place of more believableacting, rather than forced lines, little to no chemistry, and thatconstant constipated look on Edwards face at any given moment. Bringthe boy some Pepto and re-shoot that whole damn movie. I am justPRAYING they do a better job on the second movie (if there will even bea second movie).
