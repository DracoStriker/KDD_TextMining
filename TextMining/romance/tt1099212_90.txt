I really wanted to love Twilight. I mean, I'm a fan of the series but Iadmit that they aren't the best in contemporary literature, you canspend a couple of carefree hours reading them but they are nothingmore, so I thought: usually when a book isn't a masterpiece, the movieis better. Man I was wrong, so wrong this time. How can you have adecent action flick when it is announced in January-February, filmedduring the spring, post-produced for some months and then released inNovember? You can't: special effects are rustled up, they aren'tacceptable anymore when you have seen wonders like Lord of the Rings orone of the Harry Potters. They seem to come out from 90's, I suppose.And then, the actors: Kristen Stewart is monotonous and shows noexpressions or feelings, her Bella almost can't keep her eyes open;Robert Pattinson is gorgeous but can't exactly act; I only liked thecastings of Jessica (wonderful Anna Kendrick), Esme and Rosalie. AshleyGreen is pretty as Alice, but she isn't given much screen time. Lastbut not least, the best part in the book is the building up of Edwardand Bella's romance: here it's totally cut, they pass ? in 10 minutes ?from angst and indifference to great love. I think it's because Bella'sintroduction in Forks is too long. Dialogues are awful, too. Please, ifyou must continue the saga, choose a new director and a newscreenplayer, otherwise Summit is going to lose some of its audience.
