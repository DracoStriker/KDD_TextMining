I saw the movie before i reed the books. I hardly even knew what themovie was about. And I found it rather boring and a bit hard tounderstand at times. I couldn't really see the love. Everythinghappened so fast that I really couldn't understand when they fell inlove. And I didn't see any chemistry between Kirsten and Robert, theyfelt more like brother and sister.The thing that annoyed me the most was the lack of emotions in KirstenStewarts acting (if you can even call it acting). She looked bored andconfused during the hole movie, and had a very hard time getting herline out in spoken words. There was just a hole lot of stops andstuttering. I think the movie would of been better of with anotheractress.The movie does grow in you, and the only reason i'm giving it a two isthe charm of Robert Pattinson and the the rest of the Cullen family.After I read the books I disliked it even more. I couldn't get thefeeling of love, feel your heart pound faster and harder. There was nomagic. I wanted to fall in love watching the movie just like I did wheni read the book.
