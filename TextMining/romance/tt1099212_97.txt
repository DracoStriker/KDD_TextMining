this movie is really stupid but not in an obvious way. They have asecret 'subtly'running for the first hour which if you haven't seen aT.V you might not guess. My advice is to watch any Heath Ledger moviecause it has a far better plot and cute guy. Enough saidThe thing about this is that it is not a funny comedy, an eventfulaction movie, an emotion filled drama or basically any type of genre.I, for one, was confused. It was obvious what was going to happen to athree year old. FYI I watched this with a three year old who thoughtthis was far to unintelligent. Although it may confuse am.... no one.Can I saw to summarise that I was confused as to the point of this. Thedirector laughed his "you know what" off all the way to the bank. Thismovie contained more stars less tanned than me and i'm a red headedIrish man. But in closing, this film is an amazement to any person who cannottackle the complexity of George of the Jungle
