I have to say, I don't get why there is so much fuss over this film. Iknow, I am not a teenager, but I thought that teens were smarter thesedays. When I went to see this film, I saw a bunch of bad actors tryingto portray all of this angst and ended up looking really constipated.The story drug on and on, with no connections. And the vampire's skinturns glittery in sunlight? Is this a vampire film or My Pretty Pony?Stupid and a total bore. I apologize to all of the people who love thisfilm, I think that a lot of the fans of the picture are also fans ofthe book series, which warrants the sequels. I, as a viewer who had notread the books, found the characters, especially the protagonist,annoyingly vapid and vacant. This film makes me worrisome about theyounger generation.
