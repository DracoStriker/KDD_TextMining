An incredibly noisy mess of a film filled with nonsensical dialog,modern music that makes no sense in the setting and acting like out ofcartoons. This director is all flash over substance, seems like hedirected it on 10 hits of acid. Nothing original, nothing new about it.This is a film for simpletons and the weak minded.Dull beyond belief. Headache inducing. You will want to shoot yourselfin the head after twenty minutes. I can't imagine anyone who actuallyliked this and have to give it a one star to counteract the 10 starreviews by people who most certainly don't know what good movies areabout.Simply ruined Gatsby, the book was never like this, but anyone under 30will think it's cool. Rap music? Really?
