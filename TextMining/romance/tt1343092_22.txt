Don't waste your money. Rather than conveying the excess of the time,this film is brimming with trite costume and set design, and more thananything - has some really bad acting. Obvious and boring. The actorsare not compelling. Ms. Mulligan is so bad, she sounds and looks as itshe has been dubbed by another actor. Plus, she is simply notattractive enough in appearance or delivery to convince anyone that sheis a love interest. The Myrtle character truly looks like a cartoon.The sets look as if they have been computer generated, which I thinkthey were. The first long shot to Gatsby's house looks amateurish, asif a film student has built a model. And then filmed it. The filmcontains one cliché after another. Loud does not equal fascinating.Very, very disappointing. This film makes the Redford version look likea masterpiece.
