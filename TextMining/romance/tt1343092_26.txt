The jury has been out on Baz Luhrmann for a long time. A lot of peoplewere won over by the quirky combination of Claire Danes + LeonardoDiCaprio in 'Romeo + Juliet'. Others (myself included) were taken in bythe sheer over-the-topness of 'Moulin Rouge'. I recently saw that againand found that it has aged badly. But, I decided to give 'The GreatGatsby' a chance, anyway. I figured, why not? What have I got to lose?Well, apart from the admission price and a few hours of my life, I findthat my good memories of the book and of the 1974 version (RobertRedford, Mia Farrow) have been permanently compromised by this piece ofrubbish. Let's start with the casting: Tobey Maguire was a mistake,Carey Mulligan was a big mistake, Leo is good. On to the specialeffects: atrocious! You'd think with this kind of budget, they could doa decent chroma key. Finally, the so-called production design: oh mygod, how could they do this to Fitzgerald?!?!?! The whole picture islike an extended hip-hop video, complete with extras and music frommore than one specimen of the genre. If someone had only told me thatthe executive producer is Jay Z, I might have had a chance of saving mytime, money and self-respect. Fitzgerald did not deserve to be sorudely travestied. The jury on the Luhrmann case is in: guilty of beinga hack.
