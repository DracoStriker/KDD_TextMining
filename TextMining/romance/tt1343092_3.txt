Baz Luhrmann really has outdone himself in this film. The cast isbeautiful as is the script. The scenes are a visual feast. It is as ifLuhrmann reached into Fitzgerald's vision of the 20's, pulled out theheart of it and merged it with what society is today, over nine decadeslater. Alongside personal strife, we see social inequality, abuse ofdrugs and alcohol, political and moral corruption, and the failure offinancial institutions and their responsibility to people. This filmwill make you feel that these issues will always be relevant, and thatnot much changes from generation to generation.The achingly romantic and hopeful Gatsby is played impeccably byDiCaprio. He has aged into a beautiful man while still possessing thoseboyish good looks. The beginning of the film has the viewer itching tosee Gatsby and hear him speak, and when he finally appears he holds onand captivates throughout the film. The film may awaken something inyou, a memory of when you were crazy in love with a person or in lovewith an idea for what your life should be. DiCaprio embodies a dreamand makes you root for him, even though he is shown to be a liar and aman who is desperately trying to steal another's wife- all that doesnot matter because we see the gentle child-like frailty in him andidentify with it. DiCaprio is an excellent actor and was perfect forthe role.I must say that I didn't think that Mulligan can pull the role ofDaisy, who in my mind was supposed to be a flawless beauty. However,she didn't disappoint. It made Gatsby's love and desire for her evenmore fascinating- she was beautiful to him and that's all thatmattered. Mulligan was able to play the spoiled and dazed rich girlwell, while adding an emotional dimension to the character. TobeyMcguire definitely held his own, and his story line had an interestingdeviation from the novel which was enjoyable. All in all I think it isa must see this year for movie buffs.
