I had high expectations of this movie, with Leonardo Dicaprio playingGatsby and the overall cast quite fitting for their roles.After the first 5 minutes, however, i was left completely disappointed.Partying scenes were glamorous, yes, but the overall effect lookedunauthentic. All right, I could put up with that, "for Dicaprio"-I toldmyself, but as soon as the music played, i knew that this was going tobe one of the movies which i would fast-forward in 15 minutes or so.HIp Hop, in a movie set in 1922, Beyonce, in a movie set in 1922.Music blaring into my ears and preventing me from concentrating on themovie.It was so bad, I had to register an account on IMDb, clicked on thereview link for about 20 times because it kept asking me to confirm myemail and finally writing down these words.Really, it's best you don't watch it at all.
