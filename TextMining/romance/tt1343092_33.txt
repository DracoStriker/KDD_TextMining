How this horrid mess has such a high rating is beyond me. Cinematography: 7 Script: 3 Soundtrack: -23 Adaptation from book: Ican't count that low.The thing that makes me want to vomit the most is how this movie triesto take an older culture and 'spice it up' by adding modern things. Itfails miserably. If you have seen "The matrix" trilogy, imagine the bigparty/rave scene after Morpheus' speech being filled with banjosplaying Mozart. This movie is that style of brain violation.Anyone who has read a book once or thrice prior to it being turned intoa movie will understand that you can't capture everything from the textin the time allowed for most films. This is different, it's anabomination. Not only were many key elements left out of the story,it's like it was produced by teenagers who work for Disney and haveseen no other sort of film and have probably never read a book. Honestly, the price of buying or borrowing the book is far less thanthe cost of theater tickets or a DVD. Even if you're into downloadingpirated movies, this one isn't worth the bandwidth. Anyone who ratesthis above a 3 clearly lacks the intellect and attention span to haveeven made it through the Cliff's notes for this, much less the book.This is truly horrible.
