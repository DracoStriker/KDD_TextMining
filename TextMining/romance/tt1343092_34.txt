When Nick Carraway and Gatsby drive over the Queensboro Bridge, Nicksays, "I didn't know what to think." Unlike Mr. Carraway, I "do" knowwhat to think: This adaptation of "The Great Gatsby" must have F. ScottFitzgerald rolling in his grave! If the setting is 1922 Long Islandduring the Jazz Age, then what the hell is "hip hop" doing in thesoundtrack? Are we now catering to the vapid generation because theydon't wish to read the classics? And if they do manage to crack open abook now and then, is this the way to make literature more palatable?Yes, I'll have a syrupy coating of tasteless CGI, irregular scenetransitions, mediocre acting, and hip hop to go, please? DiCaprio held his own, as usual, but why did he sign up in the firstplace. He should have thrown the script out the window and walked out.As for Director Luhrmann, forgive me when I say, your job at the gasstation is still waiting for you. Better stick to what you know.
