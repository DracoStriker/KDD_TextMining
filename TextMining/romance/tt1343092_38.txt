Never got to the point of downvoting at such extent a movie. Startingfrom the music, to the exaggerated make up and costumes, to the lack offidelity to the original book's storyline, the actors who are just notconvincing... Wow, I am stupefied and wonder why this movie ever cameto life? This movie is not based on Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby - it wasjust inspired by it - as it has little less to nothing to do with thebook. I am not a particular fan of classics, but with respect toeverybody's intellectual capacity of recognizing true acting - go watchJack Clayton's Great Gatsby from 1974 with Robert Redford and MiaFarrow. Oh, and some movies are just not musical material, Mr BazLuhrmann!
