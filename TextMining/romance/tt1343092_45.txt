God! what were they thinking!, Leonardo has become good at playing useless,hollow characters and overacting in them.what a true waste. The period description is not accurate, the sets arenot believable as 20,30's newyork. Too much of trickery, effect laden set design, BAD BAD 3dThe 20's are better represented in the 'thirteenth floor' sci-fi movie. What a waste, the start of movie is a mess of whoreing around2nd part is supposed to be a romantic drama , but what a stupid one,its not that difficult to get a divorce etc, utter non-senseI walked out around 1/2 way, tried going back in and watching again buttoo many cheesy clichés also whats with the hip-hop and electro music, I was hoping to hearsome jazzy tunes, the mood was out of touch with period.I researched the movie before going and only went because the directoris the same as of 'Australia' which I liked a lot, what a waste
