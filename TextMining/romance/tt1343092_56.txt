From a fantastic source novel that challenges the perception of theAmerican Dream during the dying idealism of 1925 comes a shallow andinsulting adaptation that completely misses the mark of the originalwork.Luhraman completely missed the mark here, he treats Gatsby as a storyof Gatsby and Daisy's romance, completely missing out the thematicmessage of the death of the American Dream in this era. We are'treated' to a film that over uses CGI to create what feels asnightmarish as several Tim Burton films, as opposed to the tragic dramathat Fitzgerald created.The music, acting and party scenes all serve to completely kill theappeal and mood of the novel, creating a pathetic teen love story. This film is pure and utter garbage, don't waste your time.
