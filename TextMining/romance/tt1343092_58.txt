So much time was spent on the staging of the elaborate parties, whichwas well done, that there was little for the core of the plot... thethree affairs, one with Nick and Jordan, totally ignored. Of course themovie can't cover everything and it did hit the high spots accurately,but there is no passion, only ersatz parties, which anachronistic musicincluding "rap" at one point is played. It's just poorly written.Fitzgerald's book had soul and vision of a society corrupted by greed.This movie seems to extol the value of greed, proving that "all thatglitters is not gold" as far as movie making goes. DiCaprio was good aswas Maquire, but the women seem more like mannequins... perhaps echoingperformances of silent screen stars of the 20s.
