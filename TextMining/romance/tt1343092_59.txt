Why write a hundred lines about this movie, when a few words suffice?Please let me however describe these 4 words so that people can bettersee what I mean.1) Beautiful Please, do not misunderstand me: the actors were reallygreat, and the scenery as well (as for special effects, maybe it wasintended, but I really disliked them and considered them poor).2) Long Indeed it was. Too long for the kind of story that was told.Worse, several aspects of the movie were not even developed (I have atleast 3 in mind).3) Boring I was almost falling asleep all movie long. Maybe it was mydisliking the early 20th century that made this movie boring, but,really, it seemed to me like nothing was really into motion there.4) Sad No spoilers here. But yeah, definitely sad. Absolutely not forpeople looking for funny and joy-bringing movies.Hence the poor rate.
