The movie is essentially an overstated and overcomplicated series ofemotional gradations that castrate and mystify what the reality of themovie is: a cheesy, unoriginal and unilateral (the admiration of Gatsbyby Carraway never seems to be reciprocated by Gatby ) "friendship" thatcould have been wrapped up in an hour. The extra 1h 20 mins isdedicated towards the enchanted extravagant lifestyle of Gatsby and theperks of being ultra-rich in New York during that time (or any othertime for that matter). I guess the movie is best suited for a certainsegment of viewer-ship- Kids and their discernible craving forenchantment.
