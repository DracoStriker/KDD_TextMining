How did Dicaprio and Maguire ever agree to be in this movie? It's notjust average. It's simply bad. It's not even entertaining. Leavingaside that it's not by far an accurate representation of Fitzgerald'swork and judging it only as a movie... it's still probably the worstmovie Dicaprio's been in for the past 15 years. Some of the worstthings about it: - Gatsby is portrayed like a pathetic wannabe - Carey Mulligan looks like she's always about to break into tears -and no,her character isn't supposed to do that, that's just her face inevery movie she's ever done - None of the characters have any real form of substance - they're verysuperficially built - The story has been turned into a compressed soap opera drama thatprobably wouldn't even impress a 12 year old Best part about this movie: pretty colours and once in a while someacceptable music. Only watch it if you really, really can't get out of it.
