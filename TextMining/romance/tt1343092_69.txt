Painful to watch.Bet they were thankful to make the box office profits with Leo's nameattached to it because otherwise this would have been a straight to DVDflop. Toby Maguire attached to this should have been the give awayespecially with the spiral demise of the Spiderman franchise he wasattached to. The only reason I watched it was because of Leo and afterthe first 10 minutes only watched far enough to see the scene that hasmade so many great meme's.
