This is my first review here I think...was planning on reviewing somescience-fiction/action movies since I'm more into those , but at theend I'm here to say that "The Great Gatsby" is an extremely excellentmovie. Never read the book nor seen the older movie , but this one isabsolutely amazing , great actors , great story , you simply cannot askfor more. There are few movies that have an impact emotionally on the viewer ,and this is one of them.Definitely worth watching!
