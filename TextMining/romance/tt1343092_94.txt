I did not read the novel, nor saw the 1974 movie (or rather, I forgotabout it, because I found it very boring). Also, I liked a lot both"Strictly Ballroom" and "Romeo+Juliet", so I was definitely not awed bythe novel or prejudiced against the director.Unfortunately, my open-minded approach did not help. This movie is amighty mess, for two basic reasons that have nothing do with the sourcematerial or Luhrmann notorious bombastic style. These reasons are:awful acting and lack of chemistry, and they make the whole storycollapse.Maguire is awful. I never noticed what a bad actor he is until I sawhim playing Carraway. All he does is stare with his beady eyes and makegrimaces. Being in almost every scene, he positively destroyed themovie.Di Caprio e Mulligan have zero chemistry. Impossible to believe in anypassionate feeling between these two.Besides, spoiled, coward and selfish Daisy Buchanan is one of the mostrepulsive fictional characters. It was weird to see two men fightingfor the affection of such an obnoxious woman, whose only saving graceis a pretty face. Not unusual, but I just could not buy into the"tragedy" of mystery man Gatsby pining for shallow Daisy.I wanted totell him to get a grip and find a better woman.Then comes the horrid music, the overblown party scenes and materialismtrumping "feelings" in every scene (what was that throwing shirts atDaisy? Was Gatsby employed by a luxury garment store?).If I have to save something, I'd go for the Lana Del Rey song and thefinal minute of the movie, both because I liked the typing on screenand because it brought this mess to a much awaited closure. "So we beaton, boats against the current..." (I did my research ....)
