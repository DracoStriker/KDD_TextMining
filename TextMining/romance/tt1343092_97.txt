Maybe it's not possible to portray one of the greatest books everwritten on the silver screen. This is at least the third time and I'vebeen really disappointed all three. Neither DiCaprio or Redford (bothof whom I really like) catch the true sense of the mysterious Gatsby.At least Redford was a bit detached. His failures of the past are inhis head. DiCaprio (or the script he must follow) make him seem like agiddy love soaked schoolboy. He is so obsessed as to appear weak andmaudlin. Another issue, however, is with the portrayal of NickCarraway. Tobey Maguire is just too cute. I never pictured Nick as thelittle boy seen here (Sam Waterston, while not perfect, at least seemedlike a possibility). Again, I like Maguire in other roles, but here heseems nothing more that Gatsby's toy. He's still physically lacking asa leading man. Mostly, it just lacked a bit of pizazz. Luhrman seems tothink he can do it all visually, but this is a story of lost souls,trying to recover something they can't seem to reach. It fades andfades and in the end, it's hard to care much. Also, the portrayals ofDaisy and Jordan just don't seem to draw us in.
