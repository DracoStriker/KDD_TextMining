I understand that this movie is set in "the roaring 20's" and thateverything is supposed to be extravagant, but the way this movie wasmade stripped it of its credibility.In the beginning of the movie, Nick Carraway is telling his story yearslater from an alcohol rehabilitation center. Right from the start, thestory is altered. If the opening scene doesn't coincide with the novel,what other major changes can we expect? Is this movie going to beanything like Fitzgerald's novel? Later we arrive at the house party scenes. The party at Gatsby's estatewas just like I imagined. I was convinced that this was 1920'sauthentic, until I heard Jay-Z and Kanye West in the background. Maybethis wasn't a problem for other people but to me the music was out ofplace. My last problem with this movie's execution was the car chase scenes.Something about the set made the entire scene look like a cartoon. WasI supposed to believe that Gatsby could actually drive 100 miles perhour without looking or steering? Or was the movie now completelyfictional. I expected a different movie. This movie was hardly similar to thenovel "The Great Gatsby" and I think the director could have done abetter job to make it like the book.
