If you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young andfoolish teenage boys this is the movie for you. Every other linecontains the F word and for some reason the director thought penisjokes are the funniest around.The story is about as hollow as the humor. It's a cheap and bland storyabout revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of "love" that isas misguided as the character's personality.The movie is littered withsarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a while.Ryan Reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie, cursingand making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he isvery funny. This is the most overrated movie I've seen. Most of these reviews onIMDb had to have been paid for. Hollywood had to have paid for thishype or people these days have really low standards. This is a low browfilm like no other.Save 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie.
