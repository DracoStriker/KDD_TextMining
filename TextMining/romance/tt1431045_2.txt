Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious readingreviews with One Star because the movie had "Foul Language" and "SexScenes" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriatefor their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes ofresearch you could have determined if this movie was for you or notWith that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting andwriting were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you areeasily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the moviefor you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for2 straight hours you will love this movie.
