I do not honestly see what is to like about this movie. As a comic bookfan and open to the occasional comic-based movie, I was absolutelydisgusted with this one. I do not understand how this tired film evenwas considered for the Golden Globes. It just boggles my mind entirely.Granted Ryan Reynolds is supposed to be comedy relief in most of hismovies, he failed to come up to that level in this one. When I wasforced to watch this by my older brother, he loved it...as did his own13-year-old daughter. For the record, with the amount of stronglanguage and violence in this movie (and I usually have no problem withviolence or language in a movie, particularly R-rated ones), I wouldn'thave allowed her to see it even with parental supervision.The way I see it, Ryan was just phoning it in on this one. I am partialto the occasional breaking of the fourth wall with an actor/actressaddressing the audience, but this was absolutely ridiculous. If hewasn't in literally every single scene, he was addressing the audience.There were so many inappropriate jokes in here (even for my liking)that it would have driven a high school boy into a frenzy. And let'snot forget the channeling of Ferris Bueller in the very end. That wasentirely unnecessary. I had such a hard time watching this movie that it was amazing that Idid. Probably the best word to describe this waste is "juvenile," ifthat much. It was the worst two hours of my life that I can't get back.I have seen many comic-based movies in my time, but this one wasprobably the worst. Do not sit down and watch this. You will get aheadache and/or feel nauseous.
