It's perfect, enough said. This movie is so good i can't stop watchingthe first scene over and over again. Just look at any other Marvelmovie out there and you'll find no movie as good as this one (exceptfor the Dark Knight). Granted it has the same plot as many othermovies, revenge quest, saving your girlfriend, bla bla bla. The comedy,the constant fourth wall breaking, trashing other Marvel movies fortheir mistakes especially Ryan Reynolds previous performance as theGreen Lantern, and of course Deadpool's characteristics that makes thewhole movie so epic. Deadpool delivers a movie unlike any Marvel moviemade before.
