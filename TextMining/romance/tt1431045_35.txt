How does this have 8 out of 10 stars?! It stinks! It's too stuffed withlanguage and violence. A little wouldn't hurt. It would make your heartpound faster and you cringe, which is good. But in this case, had tolook away from the screen and cover ears. Really bad humor, too. Ican't believe this is Marvel! It's not the best action movie; Iwouldn't be surprised if it's the worst. No wonder it is rated R--it'san abbreviation for "rotten."
