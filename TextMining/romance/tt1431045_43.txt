Released in 2016, "Deadpool" stars Ryan Reynolds as a former SpecialForces operative turned mercenary who is permanently scarred afterundergoing a dubious operation, but is enhanced with acceleratedhealing powers. He adopts the alter ego Deadpool and, armed with hisnew abilities and a twisted sense of humor, hunts down the man whonearly destroyed his life. Morena Baccarin plays his potential babewhile Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand are on hand as Colossus andNegasonic Teenage Warhead.This is a creative, energetic and often funny parody of Marvelsuperhero movies highlighted by cutie Baccarin and an excellentportrayal of Colossus (of the X-Men); the X-teen is pretty cool too.Reynolds is outstanding as the protagonist, but Wade/Deadpool is themain problem with the movie. While there are glimpses of Wade'spotential good side throughout, he's so foul-mouthed and vulgar it'shard to see. While consistently amusing, the movie's also a barrageagainst one's moral senses. I suppose this would be easier to overlookif you grew up in some sheethole where the dirtbag clientele cussedevery other word peppered with nasty sexual-oriented verbiage.Don't get me wrong here, a couple of my favorite superheroes areradical antiheroes, like Wolverine and The Punisher, not to mention myfavorite superhero flick is 2009's "Watchmen," which is hardly agoody-goody superhero movie. But "Deadpool" is just so over-the-topfoul & vulgar it becomes a turnoff after 15 minutes DESPITE its goodhumor and innovative filmmaking. The movie will no doubt be cited inchronicles on the decline of Western Civilization. That said, themessage at the end is unexpected and good (I don't want to give itaway, but it has to do with Deadpool's babe).Unfortunately, "Deadpool" is so offensive and nasty it overshadows itsattributes and I have no desire to see it again. In fact, I threw theDVD in the trash.The movie runs 108 minutes and was shot in Vancouver & Victoria,British Columbia.GRADE: D+
