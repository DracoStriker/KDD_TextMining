Deadpool is one of the worst Marvel comic book movies ever made and oneof the worst films and one of the silliest films I've ever watched. Itwas silly and over the top. The action was crazy, the language wasreally bad and it was rude. It was a load of crap. After an hour ofwatching the film, I gave up on it and 80 minutes into the film Istopped watching the film. I completely lost interest in it and I gotfed up with it. Although Ryan Reynolds really suits the role and wasborn to play Wade Wilson/Deadpool, the character was really annoyingand he was a real pain in the ass and a bit of a knob. Deadpool was nobetter, no worst than Crank 2: High Voltage and Iron Man 2 and 3. Whata waste of 80 minutes! I am glad I didn't go and see it on the bigscreen. I give it two thumbs down.
