"Deadpool" (2016) is a hilarious super hero film. The story is a abouta witty mercenary, Wade Wilson who turns into Deadpool playedexquisitely by Ryan Reynolds, after his search for a cancer cure goeshorribly wrong. The story has drama, romance, and some serious adultcomedy.The music in this film is outstanding. Every song serves a purposewhether to emphasize the scene or add a touch of funny to an otherwiseserious action scene. The music for comedy, though very enjoyable, isoutdone by the comedic performance of Ryan Reynolds. His dry, straightfaced humor is perfect and had me gasping for air through my laughter.This film has made its way on to my favorites list and I wait in greatanticipation for "Deadpool 2."
