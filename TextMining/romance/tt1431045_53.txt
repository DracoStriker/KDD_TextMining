I really don't get you guys. Every bad review is like oh this movie isabsolutely awful because of all the dick and fart jokes. Jesus Christget over yourself and stop taking life so seriously. While scrollingthrough I even saw someone who was a fan of the x films say he hatedcollossus in this movie. It must of been because this one was true tothe comics and not the same guy from the TRASH!!! Xmen movies. If youlove X-Men and you've been disappointed with everything from the laststand to Apocalypse, this movie is probably up your alley. Oh and youshould probably check out Logan too cause that movie is amazing.
