Full of comedy behinds with a emotional love story and a damn goodstarting! CG's are greatly effected to look this real as possible.Reynolds fitted in as Deadpool as hell, makeups also. Baccarin'sperformances are just raw. Ed Skrein alright with his performances,writers could do more with character Ajax.Had a good time with DEADPOOL, in future i wants something extra-ordinary.
