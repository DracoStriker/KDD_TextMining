In essence, it is a parody of comic films, but he himself is one. So,you can not parody something, but create an equivalent. I am absolutelysure that the cinema is over. The fact that a masterpiece is createdfrom time to time does not mean anything, because the masterpiece doesnot win the billions, and they are lucrative like this. Despite somereally successful hits, I can not understand how this movie won so muchaudience and so much money. I repeat, the cinema is over. Otherwise,Ryan Reynolds is a nice artist, but there are better movies. I loveparodies, but this is a pure comic book, a bit more unusual, but acomic, so my rating is Rating - 3.
