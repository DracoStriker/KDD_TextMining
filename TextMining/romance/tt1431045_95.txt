I don't know what genre this movie is. It may be comedy. It may beaction. It is hard to say because this movie tries to be a little bitof both. But the humor in this movie is toilet humor. There is simplytoo much of it. When I watched the action scenes, the attempt at humoris very distracting. So first, yall made a movie that is not funny, andthen you have diluted action scenes. It's really bad, there is too muchdistraction in the movie. Do it like the Avengers with short funnylines after the action scenes. But I think this movie is better thanBatman vs Superman because at least something happened in this movie.It's just that they try to insert toilet humor each chance they get.Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean. It is just not funny!
