'Deadpool' desperately wants to be cool and funny but it fails on bothcounts. The best way to summarise what this film is all about is thefollowing quote - 'Have you ever heard David Beckham speak? It soundslike he mouth-sexed a can of helium.' The film is packed full of thesetype of jokes and the one I quoted is one of the better (or lesscringeworthy) ones. Most aren't funny in the slightest.I would usually write something about the plot but unfortunately thereisn't one, so no spoilers here. That's right, a movie with no plot hassomehow managed a score of 8.2 on IMDb - higher than some classics.Obviously I've missed a trick here, but 'Deadpool' didn't do anythingfor me. My score of 3 is only because of some of the action andviolence which was mildly entertaining. Otherwise this was a bore.
