My initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy thatI've seen in years. The genre has been pretty devoid of quality lately.So, I don't know if that plays a part or not and I really don't care atthis point. I enjoyed everything about this movie. It has tremendousheart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to thelives of these characters. A certain degree of patience is requiredwhile viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessaryto the story are worth getting to know. Steve Carell's character is theone everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the"A" story you wonder why and start to think that the "B" story is goingto be muddled or cliché or one to endure. Well, they're not andeverything comes together in a wonderful fashion. The entire cast hereis perfection. The overall message may be one to debate but it doesn'tmatter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so welldone.
