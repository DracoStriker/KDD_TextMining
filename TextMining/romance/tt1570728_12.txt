There had been a lot of good words about this comedy called "CrazyStupid Love." Although I am not really a guy who would go and watch aromantic comedy, I watched this one for Steve Carrell, whom I believeis one of the funniest guys in Hollywood now. This movie starts with Emily (Julianne Moore) telling her husband of 25years Cal (Steve Carrell) that she wants a divorce while they weredining in a restaurant. OK, so now I know that I have a black comedyahead of me. The movie follows Cal who was "helped" by playboy Jacob(Ryan Gosling) to get him ready to meet other women. One of the womenhe hooks up with is Kate (the hilarious Marisa Tomei). Emily on theother hand, takes up with David (the ever smarmy Kevin Bacon). Side stories include Jacob hooking up with young lawyer Hannah (EmmaStone), who in turn was hoping her colleague (Josh Groban) wouldpropose to her. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily's 13-year old son Robbie issure that his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (America's Next Top Modelfinalist Analeigh Tipton) is his soul mate. But she is in love with amuch older married man. Such is the complicated web that this movieweaves.Steve Carrell again does very well with this sad-sack character that heseems to know so well. His deadpan delivery in some pretty funnysituations that Cal gets himself into was spot on. The character ofRyan Gosling though, I find preposterous. I agree with Cal's belatedrealization that this guy is one big creep. The women basically playstraight men to the male characters, with Marisa Tomei shining in thelaughs department despite her short role.While I liked the surprises in the climax and the touching scene atRobbie's graduation, the rest of the film did not really appeal to metoo much. Yes, there were funny parts but a lot fall flat for me. Imust say that for conservatives, there can be a lot of uncomfortablesituations that may be hard to watch in this film. I know women maydisagree with me about Ryan Gosling's part though.
