I feel compelled to write as I can't believe the rating this movie has.We've seen it all before many times and this movie brings nothing new.OK let me begin, the first 40 minutes are funny, if it ended there itwould be 10, Carrell & Gosling give good performances and really gel asa duo but like so many comedies it loses it's way and the mid sectiondrags only to find that the finale is a big sentimental schmaltz thatreally shouldn't be present in a comedy. Why do American comediesalways do this (Sandler, Carrey)? It's better than Just go with it, itcouldn't be any worse!, and the performances are all first rate, it'sjust a pity the project is wanting.
