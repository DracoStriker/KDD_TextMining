I actually found it quite engaging eventually; it was a little hard toget into at first but when the narrative began to settle down I couldsee a structure there that had potential. Brief summary: When EmilyWeaver (Julianne Moore) announces to her husband Cal (Steve Carell)that she wants a divorce, his world collapses around him. She had sleptwith another man, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) and Cal finds that hardto take since they had been together since high school. He takes togoing to bars to drown his sorrows and is taken under the wing of JacobPalmer (Ryan Gosling) who shows him how to dress, behave and (mostimportantly) how to pick up women. At this he is quite successful(eventually) but he feels there is still something missing. Meanwhilethere are a couple of other sub-plots going on. One involves Cal's son,Robbie (Jonah Bobo), who has become infatuated with his babysitter,Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). She, meanwhile is holding a torch for Cal?With me so far?... Also, there is law student, Hannah (Emma Stone) whoJacob had been unsuccessful in picking up when we first meet him (Ican't really say any more about her without giving too much away, sohere I'll stop). All these threads eventually tie together in what (attimes) appears like a French farce, but which does ultimately have avery valid point.All the performances were very good with Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling andJulianne Moore taking centre stage. I thought Kevin Bacon was slightlyunderused, and more could have been made of Emma Stone's character.Over all, it's pretty well made but the narrative does tend to wanderin places. An endearing film that does have quite a strong messageabout love and about soul mates. I freely admit this old romantic foundit quite relatable.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.5/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts ofa SteelMonster.
