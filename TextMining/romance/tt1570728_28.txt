So my wife an I were at Blockbuster (yes Blockbuster! haha) and werelooking for a good comedy. Saw Steven Carell on the movie box, and said"This should be good, let's go for it".hmmm, my wife fell asleep on minute 30'. I fell asleep on minute 50'.If I could sum up the movie in one word I would say... "cheesy" Thewriters of this movie need help. Just having Steve Carell in the moviedoesn't make it funny... you need to write funny stuff. It had a lot ofdrama sequences and some funny skits.. but nothing original.Ryan Gosling's character was so corny. He is a good actor, but hislines were so false sounding that I thought I was watching a SaturdayNight Live "lady's man" re-run. I'm surprised it has a high rating here in IMDb.
