Crazy, Stupid, Love is a romantic comedy with a big heart.That is it isa refreshing change and almost a throwback to a golden era of romance.It relies on the sharp writing by Dan Fogelman and the sparklychemistry of its cast, led by Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, JulianneMoore, and the emerging superstar Emma Stone. John CarrollLynch,Analeigh Tipton,Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon play key supportingroles.It's not that the plot is ground-breaking but it is maybe thefact, the appeal of it is that it's all too easy to relate to thecharacters and the story.At forty-something,straight-laced Cal Weaver is living a perfect lifewith the dream-good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to hishigh school sweetheart. But when Cal learns that his wife, Emily hascheated on him and wants a divorce, his life quickly unravels. Worse,in today's single world, Cal, who hasn't dated in decades, stands outas the epitome of being uncomfortable as a single person. Now spendinghis free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal istaken on as wing man and protégée to handsome, thirty-something playerJacob Palmer.This is not the ultimate romantic comedy.It is one that makes you fallas hard for the characters as they do for one another while savoringtheir every interaction.Also,it seems fresher and less recycled thanmuch of the movies released out there.It gets better and funnier aftera labored and lumbering start, which is entirely the opposite of mostHollywood comedies.It's the interplay between the characters, the truehumanity of their emotions that is long missing from many contemporaryromcoms that set this film in a class of its own.
