there is an old saying- "if you throw enough s**t at a wall, some of itwill stick..." and that is what Hollywood is doing almost constantlythese days.Like accountants they calculate- "Ryan Gosling, plus Emma Stone, plusJulianne Moore, plus Steve Carell... this movie should gross $300million... (and it did only $143 million)" This is an unimaginative and uninspired 'formula movie' that you willswear you have seen before, and it's easy to understand why.Carell plays an identical character to his depressed-loser from 'LittleMiss Sunshine' meets his no-idea loser characters from 'the Forty YearVirgin' and 'the Office'. At this point he's just turning up andreading lines, occasionally raising or lowering his volume.Gosling has been told by the media that he is gods gift to women and iscreepily vomitus in his- 'cool person does a makeover on a loser' roll(hasn't that been done to death already?).Kevin Bacon? I'm embarrassed for the guy, he's an A-list actor playinga C-list doofus supporting role? I suspect Kyra Sedgwick made him do itfor losing a bet.Stone can do better than this, she was amazing in 'Birdman' and solovable as 'Gwen Stacy' but just punches the time-card here.It has that sickly- 'every story/character is separate, but allconnected with a twist by the end' template that has become so overusedin all of the "Day" movies (Valentines, Mother's, New Year's etc.)' andevery Rom-com since 'Love Actually'. It's so choreographed, your eyeswill roll like a cartoon character at the predictability of this scriptthat was obviously written with a 'scriptwriters template program'(probably the 'Love Actually' template?).This is a- 'straight to DVD' type movie, that I hope you have someonewilling to make-out with while you watch, or a lot of drinks choke downthis very ordinary Steve Carell joint.
