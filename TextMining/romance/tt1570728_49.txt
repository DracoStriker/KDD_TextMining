I appear to be alone in this thought, but I thought this was awful,just dreadful. Bad script, bad acting, bad close-ups, but most of all-- bad directing.Staring off with the most annoying actress to ever by on screen --ANALEIGH Tipton. Oh, please you can barely look at her she is so awful.Every shot of her and everyone else is so tight it makes youuncomfortable. There is so much wrong with this film I really don'tknow where to start, so I'll just say: the big "twist" is just plainstupid -- who cares? It doesn't add anything to the story. The childporn thing is just creepy. The main story element of the failingmarriage is never really fleshed out. The other main story point -- ofSteve Carrell's character becoming a horn dog -- is odd andoff-putting. The whole movie is just plain weird. That's as best as Ican sum it up. The casting is especially odd. Marissa Tomei and Kevinbacon are thrown in for -- oh, I don't know. The 13-year old son isbad. The little girl has no lines at all. Julianna Moore is just notgood here -- comes off as a harpy. The only saving grace is -- EmmaStone. She is kind of radiant, if that makes any sense. But the storyline she has really doesn't make sense, because Ryan Gosling also playsa horn dog with no sense of goodness, who only goes after really hotchicks so, no -- he would NOT seek her out from a crowded bar.Not worth your money. Skip this one.
