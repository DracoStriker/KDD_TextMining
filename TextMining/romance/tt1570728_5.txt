I saw this expecting an amusing, albeit predictable, movie. Boy was Ipleasantly surprised! Steve Carell plays a man, Cal, blindsided by his wife's sudden requestfor a divorce. While wallowing in self pity at the local bar, Jacob(Ryan Gossling) decides to turn him into a project, and introduce himto the wonderful world of womanizing.....But you've seen that from thepreviews right? What comes next is a great look at love, from firstcrushes to long term marriage.This movie is the perfect blend of funny and sweet (the entire theatrewas laughing throughout). Great performances from the whole cast,including a surprisingly refreshing change for Steve Carell. Thewriting was perfect, the pacing was great.... A perfect date movie! Notoverly sappy and not typical "chick flick" drivel.
