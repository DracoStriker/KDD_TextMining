Most rom-coms fill clichéd ,youve seen that before,there's nooriginality that goes in them.Just recycling something that workedbefore.That's where Crazy Stupid love comes in that is not only dares to bedifferent but cares for its characters and I suspect that is why a lotof the talented cast signed up for it.Steven Carell is charming perfect and I think this might his best roleyet.The rest of the cast is equally amazingThe dialogue is also well written and has a theme underneath all thelaughs.That being said its not a perfect movie,but it is a reallyenjoyable and refreshing watch.
