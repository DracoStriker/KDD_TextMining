I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie at the theater,but I amreally glad I did. The characters are well played out, not very likableat first, but after you get to know the cast, you really feel foreveryone. I thought Julianne Moore & Steve Carrell had great chemistrywith their relationship. Super script, nice directing, great castingwith Robbie, the son. This movie will surprise you at how good it is. Iloved how you saw the characters at work, at home, at the bar & withtheir friends. This was very well played out & comes together in theend extremely well. Ryan Gosling is very hot even when he is sleazy.Great date night movie!!
