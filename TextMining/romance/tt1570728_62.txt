Surprisingly good, especially for a romantic-comedy, as the bar is setvery low in this genre. It's more the comedy than the romance thatworks though. Very funny, and at times a parody of rom-coms. Gets a bitsilly and contrived at times but thankfully these moments don't lastlong. Ending is also a bit trite and unprofound, despite seeming to beheading for something big.Great performances all round. Steve Carell does his usual nerdy guy-next-door thing, Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as the smooth operator,Emma Stone is great as his love interest. Solid work from JulianneMoore and good support from Analeigh Tipton, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomeiand Jonah Bobo.
