I had higher expectations of this movie based on the actors involved.The first part is not that bad, but it goes downhill after SteveCarell's character stops playing the miserable and cheated on husbandand becomes a womanizer. This movie offers an extremely moronic view ofhuman relationships, since Gosling's character eventually decides tostop chasing skirts after he meets Mrs. right of course and JulianneMoore's character all of a sudden wants her husband back after cheatingon him (the reason for this is never spelled out, the same with why shefelt the need to have sex with another guy in the first place). Theicing on the cake of stupidity is the relationship between the son ofthe family and the nanny, that concludes with the latter offering somephotos of her posing naked to the former as a means of compensating(???) for the fact that he is still very young and she is not into him.In a nutshell this movie manages to offer some of the silliest romanticclichés about adult relationships, while it piles up on the creepyfactor about the teenage ones. Not a mean feat by any means!!
