I did a stupid thing when I bought this movie. I hadn't seen it. Whichis something I rarely do. I have only bought a handful of movieswithout seeing them first, and sadly, there has only been one that Ireally enjoyed and one that I liked. This was the one I liked. It has agood storyline to it and the cast make it a very enjoyable watch.This movie is about a middle-aged man. His life changes dramaticallywhen his wife, out of nowhere, asks him for a divorce. He tries torediscover his manhood with the help of a new friend. Jacob, is a guywho is very good with woman. He can pick them up so easily. It helpsthat it's really Ryan Gosling and he's got really nice abs. Anyway,Jacob tries to help our about-to-be-divorced man, Cal and the resultsare just hilarious.Overall, I give this movie a 6 out of 10, which in my ratings book is:Good.
