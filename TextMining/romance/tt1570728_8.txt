I will admit from opening bell, that I do enjoy sappy love movies. Itwas a movie that made you laugh,cry,wonder and cover your eyes. Stevekeeps true to his on screen character and his own real life strengthbut never forgetting to mumble some sort of funny line even in his most"sappy-est" of moments. I give this movie two thumbs up for its twistat the end and keeping it out of viewers sights so well! I do howeverwish that they would have developed a little more back story withRyan's character but still, a movie to be enjoyed by all. Emma deliverssome nice side humor along with her friend in the movie as well! Ibelieve Steve may have surpassed expectations of his ability to playthat main love role and still maintain his "funny guy" image.
