This was a good romantic comedy and a good role for Steve Carrell. Itis also one of those movies where the cast works well together. Itstarts off with his wife (Julianne Moore) asking him for a divorce.Everyone then hears about her affair with Kevin Bacon's character. RyanGosling overhears everything and proceed to "coach" him on approachingwomen in bars. Meanwhile, his son has a crush on his older babysitterwho has a similar crush on Carrell, and Emma Stone thinks she's gettingsomewhere with here beau. I especially liked Kevin Bacon's role.I think this was funny from start to finish. My favorite scenes werethe Scarlet Letter scene in the classroom, the "scaffold" scene, andthe misunderstanding scene at the end. Overall, this was a really goodcomedy. You will definitely love this movie if you see it!*** out of ****
