Crazy, Stupid, Love is one of those movies I can watch over and overagain and never get bored of it. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have greaton-screen chemistry and it shines through in this movie. Although thestory line is somewhat predictable with the bad-boy-changes-his-ways-because-of-a-girl and the typicalthe-babysitter's-in-love-with-the-father storyline, it's nice to seethe development of the characters through their hilarious experiences.I'm not the biggest fan of romantic comedies but Crazy, Stupid, Love isdefinitely an exception. I always picture Steve Carell to be one ofthose awkwardly funny comedians because of The 40-Year Old Virgin andThe Office, but his role in this movie opened up a new perspective. Hestill has his Steve Carell charm but brings in a new side of him as aman who has been broken by the love of his life. I have a newfound lovefor him after this movie. There's a lot going on with the plot of thestory but it's easy to follow and I was never left uninterested. Goodjob!
