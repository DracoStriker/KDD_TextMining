I knew nothing about John Ruskin prior to watching this film. However,the theme of psychological abuse of women is all too common andfamiliar.What is truly amazing about this story is that a woman was able tostand up against such odds. When you consider that John Ruskin was aman of power, fame, and wealth; it was quite an accomplishment. Godbless Effie and everyone who fights for their happiness.
