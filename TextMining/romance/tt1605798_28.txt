"When a man is wrapped up in himself, he makes a pretty small package."John RuskinTwo reasons compelled me to see Effie Gray, the 19th century periodpiece about the failed marriage of famed art critic John Ruskin and histeenage bride, Effie Gray: Emma Thompson wrote it and co-stars; JohnRuskin is a hero of mine. Neither reason is satisfied, nor in fact aredynamic people barely present in this boring biopic.The crux of the conflict is that Ruskin never consummated the marriage;John Everett Millais, the pre-Raphaelite painter plays too little apart in this adaptation; and Effie Gray (Dakota Fanning, lookinginnocently pre-Raphaelite) is so underwritten as to make me questionwhat such a wit as Thompson was thinking. Or maybe she was too busymiscasting Ruskin played by her husband, Greg Wise. In real life, Ruskin was 29 years old when he married Effie, and Wiseis 49, adding another layer of intergenerational distance not evenhistorically accurate. As depicted here, Ruskin is a mama's boy coddledby both parents, actually shielded from social interaction so he canwrite unimpeded. While mom takes John immediately to a bath when hearrives with his new bride, the bride is left to pass pleasantries withdad as she is clueless yet about how mom will co-opt her every step ofthe short marriage.What's boring about these farcical Freudian touches is that they're noteven funny or fleshed out, and Thompson gives Ruskin little chance toshow the verbal gifts that shot him to the forefront of Victorian artand architecture critics. Ruskin best expressed what he didn't do for Effie:"You cannot hammer a girl into anything. She grows as a flower does,she will wither without sun; she will decay in her sheath as anarcissus will if you do not give her air enough; she might fall anddefile her head in dust if you leave her without help at some momentsin her life; but you cannot fetter her; she must take her own fair formand way if she take any." Sesames and LiliesBy not giving Effie what he says should be done for a girl, Ruskinbecomes his own most devastating critic.
