I did like the story.She was a little girl being courted by an old man who married her onceshe became of age but would rather pleasure himself than touch his wifewho he married for the purpose of cultural stature it seems. She needsa way out which was quite difficult in the Victorian-era of England. I love movies set in the Victorian age. The costumes the art direction.The set design did stand out in this pic. It reflected how cold anddistant the family this little girl married into was.Also like how it was set up to be very stage like in the movement ofcertain people in and out of the scene.Dakota Fanning did a fine job. Give her an A for always choosingchallenging roles vs the easy ones girls her age usually take. I don'tsee this role doing anything for her career but I could be wrong.Impress that Emma Thompson wrote it.But overall the movie was too slow and the plot could have been summedup in a smaller amount of time. It seemed that a lot of the movie wasto set up the frustration the little girl had with not being able toperform any "wifely" duties and to make her husband and in-laws hated.I found them strange yes, but the film never quite explains thestrangeness, which makes it fall short.It's based on a real story and It's probably better to hear that thanto watch the movie. That'll waste less time and get to the pointfaster.
