The movie relied more on the social interaction, than maybe giving usthe scandal that resulted from the social interaction. It is a matterof taste here. It is, though, very well done period piece andbrilliantly acted. Anything that exposes history to the otherwiseignorant is to me, always worthwhile. If the scandal itself had beenshown, I might have given it a higher rating. This is of course if thequality of film making had continued. Many would regard the film asslow, but then again, most period pieces are slow. Dakota Fanningshocked me with her perfect English accent, her being an American, bornand raised. As for Emma Thompson, well, there's no beating her byanyone in the business.
