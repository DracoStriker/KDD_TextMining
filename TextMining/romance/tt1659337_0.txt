Went to an advance screening expecting your usual "shy kid in highschool learns to stick up for himself" sort of feel-good drama. Thismovie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the maturethemes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs andalcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in theQ+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotionalaspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really caredabout these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their storynever felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see thismovie!
