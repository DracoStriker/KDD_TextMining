Mostly a trite and clichéd high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscastas a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) whobefriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitmanchief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not toounbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomesromantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing,would probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays outlike a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as anadult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell,freshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even amongalterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly theonly flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexualcharacter is a bit cliché, but I was happy that they actually weren'tafraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised itdidn't land an R-rating because of it).
