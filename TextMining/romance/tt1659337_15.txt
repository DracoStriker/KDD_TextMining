This film is about a shy high school misfit who becomes a cool guyafter two seniors taking him under their wings."The Perks of Being a Wallflower" tells a story of a shy guy whoblossoms socially as he develops friendships with two step-siblings. Itinvolves the typical American high school life; with experimentation insex and drugs, experiences with dating, fights and bullying. I can seehow a lot of people can identify with the characters and events in thefilm, and hence "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" gets such a highrating. However, I think it is overrated. I thought it was a plaincoming of age drama. It doesn't push that many boundaries, and there isnothing new. The story is not particularly captivating, and in fact thesubtle subplots (involving flashbacks) can be confusing. My friends andI did not agree with the positive critics and the high ratings.
