First world problems of rich suburban kids: The Movie. Or basically, afeature-length episode of Degrassi.This movie is filled with such whiny, pretentious, self-righteous,self-pity wallowing, predictable, teenage melodrama, that is so falselyattributed to be 'deep' and 'on point' that it's just plain hard totake seriously in any stretch of the word. It's also an enigma; it's afilm that many teenagers pretend to identify with, even though its viewof typical teenage American life is so hollow, vacuous andfalsified...not to mention, very exploitative of real insecurities thatteenagers feel, which are only used as superficial character 'defining'traits, never to be elaborated on, to gain audience sympathy. It alsoonly touches on teenagers that live in wealthy suburban areas, makingfor a very narrow field of their target demographic to represent. Itcomes across as so insincere and manipulative that it's actually ratherinfuriating and insufferable.
