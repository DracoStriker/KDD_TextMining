I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. I must confess upfrontthat I find this film superfluous, given the overload of TV series andfilms that also center around high schools and their population. Onemight falsely think that striving to be popular and "cool" is the mainoccupation of an average adolescent. This film adds nothing new ororiginal to this overload, and does not even attempt to show that thereis more to the subject. Further, this film concentrates too much on asingle person, the alleged "wallflower", and leaves the remainingpersons very much as entourage.What hinders me in the scenario is that our main character can only beconsidered a wallflower for a relatively small time frame. He gets somefriends in an early stage of the story, albeit all these are older thanhe is. What helped in acquiring these friendships is that he could showseveral talents in the context of prose and poetry, and that he alsohad some talents as a stand-up comedian (probably only when underinfluence, but still).I scored a 1 (lowest) for the audience award when leaving the theater.I am at a loss why this film ended on place 8 for this award, with anaverage score of 4.52 (out of 5). I can only assume that other peoplefind interesting material in these stories, which theory seemsconfirmed by the scores on IMDb. Maybe I'm just too old (64) for this.
