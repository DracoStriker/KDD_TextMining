As someone over 21, I feel like an interloper reviewing this film. Itdidn't reflect my teenage experience back to me, but I was well pastthat phase in the early nineties. And yet, the American high school,such a tired, over-familiar arena for American cinema, seems not tohave moved on at all. Jocks, Jewish-American princesses, closet gaysand geeks all populate this film in fairly conventionalrepresentations. The lead character is in a state of fragile mentalhealth, but no Holden Caulfield. He finds friends, has a loving family,and a teacher who looks out for him. The main issue he has ishistorical abuse, but the rendering of this is so 'lite' as to beunrealistic and totally lacking in emotional impact. I can buy thatthey did not know a Bowie classic in this part of the world in theearly nineties, but I can't accept that they would ostracise a clearlyfragile friend after one drunken party faux pas. The film does notexplore the fallout of childhood abuse in meaningful terms, and itfails to capture the pain and euphoria of being a teenager. All in all,a bit flat and disappointing.
