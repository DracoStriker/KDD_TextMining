I went into watching 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' without readingthe book 1st so I didn't know what sort of story to expect. The ratingof the film was high but I was still a bit skeptical as to whether Iwould actually enjoy this, I'm glad to say I did like this film. The story is well written and the acting is very impressive. LoganLerman as Charlie was the main character, he had some problems and heplayed his role very well, he seemed like a completely believablecharacter who you really feel for. The rest of the cast were also good,especially Emma Watson. Having seen a lot of her in the Harry Pottermovies, this was the 1st time I've seen her in anything else. She madethe change with ease and her American accent was believable I thought,she really did show just how good of an actress she is. It has a serious side to it and some of the flashbacks are a littleuncomfortable to watch. The way the friendships are developing isrealistic and quite heartwarming. You really feel attached to thecharacters and maybe can relate a little to them, they are allextremely likable in their own way. I also liked the soundtrack for thefilm. Overall it's a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone whowants a good drama. 8/10.
