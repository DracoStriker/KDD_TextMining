Charlie Kelmeckis (Logan Lerman) is a loner high school freshman withdark secrets. Luckily, unusual seniors Sam (Emma Watson) and her gaystepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) adopt him into their circle offriends. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) takes a liking to him and Englishteacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) takes an interest in his work.The group of friends have amazing chemistry. They give a sense of truefriendship off-camera, and it shows on camera. The only minorobservation is that Logan Lerman seems a little too old to play a HighSchool freshman. He is suppose to be 3 years younger than the rest.Logan Lerman gives a great performance but sometimes it's harder to seehim as that much younger. Emma Watson also gives a credible performanceas a sweetheart, but she's missing the damaged core that the storyimplies. Ezra Miller has wonderful charisma.First time director Stephen Chbosky adapts his own book to the bigscreen. He does a surprisingly good job for a rookie. But at times, heseems to miss the big moments. Charlie suffers from blackouts, andsometimes the movie suffers from the same. Songs often ends abruptly,and some scenes are missing its big payoffs. There's a scene where theboys grab him into the bathroom, but he doesn't show any consequences.I get the sense that a more experienced director would be able to seethe missing bits. Charlie goes nuts in a fight but the movie holds backthe big money shots. The movie has really dark places to go. The tonestarts off as a charming, cute coming of age movie. I think a brutalscene early on would set the movie off in a darker direction. If itwants to go there, it needs to start earlier. Overall, it's a heartbreaker and a good effort for the first time director. The young castgives an exceptional performance.
