A friend of mine recommended the book, but it was really difficult tofind it in my country. I don't know the book, but the movie is almostperfect. Emma Watson (Harry Potter) is amazing and, in this movie, isthe perfect partner for Logan Lerman. They both alone have that sparkneeded to be in front of a camera but together are an explosion offeelings. Regarding the subject, when you start watching the movie, you feel thatit will be another typical High-School movie but it is not. This moviewill catch you every 5 minutes with different wonders. After watchingthe movie you will not be able to know how to feel.
