While this film might not be for everyone I think it's great for thetime that we are in. For me the film excellently portrays a story aboutbeing socially disconnected. It touched me because I can relate and I'msure (especially based on other reviews) that is has touched a lot ofother people as well. Acting was very good if not great. Emma Watson clearly has potentialand put in a good shift. Ezriel Miller was the standout in my opinionand adds more depth to the film with his character contributing so theoverall story line and message of the film.Definitely a must watch film for anyone looking to see a good storylineand take a break from all the big budget movies.
