This movie impressed me in a way that I didn't really expect.Unfortunately I haven't read the book but I want to do it as soon aspossible. From the first moments when Charlie started to write hisletter I felt a strong empathy for him. I recognized myself in his wayof seeing life, his fear of the others...and of the whole worldactually. He made me remember my own fears from the time when I enteredhigh school. I'm also a "wallflower". I'm the one who always keepsquiet, observes and understands facts. Logan Lerman's character madethis movie so worth watching for me. I found myself even in his mental illness too, because, after all, itis a symbol of the "ghosts" which haunt each of us, the drama that liesbehind our appearance. I think every teenager in this world should seethis movie! It presents all the forms of anguish, anxiety, queernessand peculiarity that take over us. This story was made to show us thatwe're not alone! and that we're not some creepy aliens!I'm only 19 but at the end of the movie I felt so very old! It made mewant to stop the time and remain there...at that moment when Charliehad finally touched the apogee of this adventure called adolescence!
