The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) High school freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) is having problems makingfriends but that all changes when he meets Sam (Emma Watson), Patrick(Ezra Miller) and their group. Soon Charlie finds himself experiencingall sorts of new adventures but the past is still there to haunt him ashe tries to make sense of his world. This is based on Stephen Chbosky'sbest-selling novel and it's a rare case where the writer also gets tonot only do the film's screenplay but also direct. I will admit rightup front that I've never read the book and I never even heard of ituntil I saw the trailer for this movie. After viewing this film itreally makes me want to read it because as a film this thing isactually very touching and rings very true to life. I thought the threeleading characters were some of the best written and most memorable tocome out of a teen film in a very long time and thankfully thescreenplay pays just as much attention to the supporting characterslike their friends to even Charlie's parents. The screenplay here iscertainly one of the best of the year and I really liked how it couldbe dramatic one moment, sad the next and then funny all in the matterof seconds. I think this is why it rings true to real life and it alsodoesn't help that you get so many memorable performances. The threeleads are certainly terrific with Watson coming off the best as thecharmer. A lot of credit also has to go to Lerman for being able tohandle such a wide range of emotions. Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, KateWalsh and Joan Cusack all do great in their smaller roles as well.Horror fans will also get a kick out of seeing Tom Savini in his roleas a shop teacher. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is certainly aclever, smart and well rounded picture that works on many levels. Ican't say if it's better or worse than the book since I haven't read itbut this film is clearly a winner.
