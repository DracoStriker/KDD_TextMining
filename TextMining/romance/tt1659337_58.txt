This should be a drama about young people lost in loneliness, theirroles as outsiders & how they handle their difficult situation. But itturns out that the movie is actually about some spoiled kids born intowealth, feeling absolutely confident & comfortable in their dandy-role,doing cool stuff all the time, partying hard & even win the hearts ofthe ones they want to. I expected a little bit more than a 90min storywithout ANY problems & aggravated circumstances. The story has noclimax & no turning point at all which makes it absolutely redundanttelling it in movie-length. you might get bored after 30min, expectinga sweeping change in their lives & relationships but you are definitelydisappointed after 90min when nothing of that happened. I have to ask:where is the drama & why these kids have no problems to speak about?American drama? American irrelevance.
