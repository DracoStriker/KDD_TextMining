I hate to see a movie like this. I really, really do. "Perks of Being AWallflower" tries oh so hard to make itself emotionally relevant, butultimately fails in that regard because it has no "base" to fall backon.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Charlie (LoganLerman), a new high school freshman who epitomizes the word"wallflower". Soon upon his arrival into high school, however, Charlieis taken under the wings of Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (EmmaWatson), who show him how to live it up and let go of some of hisinhibitions.The main trouble with this movie (minor spoilers ahead) is that I feelthe storytelling is backwards and thus the narrative never really playsout in any meaningful way. It's almost like the character developmentcomes at the very end of the movie, when the characters have alreadybeen on screen for a long, long time. Thus, when the "big emotionalpayoff" actually comes to fruition, it really doesn't because for solong the characters were just kind of floating along without a solidbase.This whole experience strikes me as a prime example of "the book beingbetter than the movie". I haven't read the book, but I'd almost betmoney that it does a much better job of conveying the adolescentmessage than this movie does. This is even despite the fact that Ithought the acting was actually pretty good. That wasn't theproblem....the problem was the overall tone and plot devices.Thus, I couldn't get into "Perks of Being A Wallflower" whatsoeverbecause I didn't feel for the characters until the very end, and bythen it was just too late. My exact star rating would be more like 1.5,but I bump it up a little because I think there was a sincere efforthere to create a good movie. It just didn't work for me.
