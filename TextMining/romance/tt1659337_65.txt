I think this movie resonates with a lot of people for a lot of reasons.I think everyone relates to these moments, in one way or another. Maybewe see ourselves in these characters, maybe we relate to the importanceof friendship and being loved at this time in our lives. I don't knowif everyone feels the way I do about it, but I know that the movie hasthe ability to elicit strong emotions, good or bad.I love how the author of the book adapted it for the screen. It feelsmore authentic,a true vision. He's able to craft a handful of reallybeautiful moments, and wrap them in a story that I find emotional andcomforting. I love the actors in all the roles, they really broughtthese characters to life.The final moments are just gorgeous, and it's the main reason for myDavid Bowie avatar.
