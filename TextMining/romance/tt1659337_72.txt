This is my all time favorite movie!! The plot is so relatable and Irespect that. I have watched this so many times and every time I watchit I get the same enjoyable experience as the first time I watched it:) I cannot rave about how much I love this enough!! It is an emotionalroller coaster and it is like you are going through it along withCharlie. I always recommend it to my friends if they have not seen itand make them watch it with me so I can experience it with them. It isvery similar to the book and I enjoy that because a lot of movies inthe past have ruined the books. This movie kept me captivated andinterested the entire time. Best 102 minutes of my life and for that Igive it a 10/10!!
