One of the very few movies I have given a 10 score.. this one trulydeserved it.I must admit this is the only movie ever made tears drip on my cheeks;especially in the end.All characters played their part perfectly; and Emma's Sam characterwas well played.. she did a good acting in the portrayal of a girlwho's heart is open to someone who really needs it.Charlie's character of someone gone through his best friend's suicidewas intense... and the whole movie plot of these 2 siblings openingtheir hearts to someone who really needed someone to be with.. it wasvery touching; and when they had to leave end of the year it was veryupsetting.Overall, the move director knew exactly how to direct this movie.
