I got this movie recommended by a girl in my media class and afterseeing that it got a pretty good rating i decided to give it a chance.The movie takes on some pretty big issues/themes as sexual abuse, drugand how tough it is to be a teenager, but i feel like we don't get toreach through the surface and are only briefly introduced to thesethings which makes it kinda "meh" And i love "me and earl and the dyinggirl" but this movie just didn't get the same emotions through, it hadgreat potential to be one of my all time favorites but it kinda slipsseveral times. 6/10 because i liked the theme and it was slightly aboveaverage
