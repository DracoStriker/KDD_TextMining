To be honest, I initially didn't expect much from this film - I hadjust finished watching the Harry Potter movies and I was just cravingsome extra Watson so I picked up this film and I absolutely loved it.And while I am being honest, there is something missing from the film,I don't know what exactly it is, maybe it was a second too long orneeded a bit more music, maybe the plot was just a tiny bit thin, Idon't know. All I know is, if it did have that extra bit, it would beextremely difficult not to give it a 10/10. All the actors wereextremely solid especially the two leads - Watson did exceptionallywell in my opinion. You always fear when a actor you have known to playone character acts in something different, you will always see them asthe old character - but that didn't happen here at all. She perfectlyslipped into this new role and does a great American accent. It isgreat to see her playing other roles and being able to act in otherroles without playing a character with the same personality as your oldcharacter like other actors do. Overall this is a solid movie and iwould recommend it to anyone looking for a high school romantic comedytype movie.
