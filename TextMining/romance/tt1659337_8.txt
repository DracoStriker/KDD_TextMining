I just saw the movie at the Pgh premiere and it was amazing. I washoping I wouldn't be disappointed because I loved the book so much. Themovie is very true to the book. A few things have been omitted orchanged but it doesn't change the mood of the story. I think thecasting choices were spot on. Emma Watson has a scene in which shetears up and cries and it was amazing. I also appreciate how Chboskymade the parents thoughtful people, unlike most teen comedies. I amdefinitely going to see this movie again because there was so much totake in. Very well done.It's also lovely to see my hometown as the backdrop. Pgh is a beautifulcity and coming out of the Fort Pitt tunnels into the city is anexperience that isn't quite captured well enough in the film. It'sstill a powerful scene and I teared up watching it.
