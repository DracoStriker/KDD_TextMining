I won't be saying much about this film I just want to recommend it, I'ma film student and I'm recently writing a screenplay about people thatwe think they don't exist but have much to tell.the character development is pretty well made, directing, and actingare OK, even though i wasn't pleased with Emma Watson's accent, EzraMiller proves he can be a great actor cause his character is verydifferent from "We need to talk about Kevin", the Photography was tooglossy for my taste, not a perfect choice, soundtrack is amazing.in general if you are looking for a film about characters and emotiondevelopment this is your type of movie, a comedy drama that developsquite nice, a very good effort for a second time director.
