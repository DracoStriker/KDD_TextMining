I originally heard about the existence of "Perks" from news articlesstating that Emma Watson would be in the movie (I'm a huge Harry Potterfan!) I read some of the book summaries and thought it soundedinteresting, so I decided to read the book. I absolutely fell in lovewith it! Ever since, I had been wanting to see the movie, and had beenupset at finding out it wasn't coming out near me in September.Finally, this past Friday it came out by me, so on Saturday a couplefriends and I went to go see it. Overall, it was an incredible movie.They did leave out certain aspects from the book, but they were mostlyparts that I could take or leave anyway. They kept the main parts in,as well as all of the best lines, which I greatly appreciated. Theending almost made me cry; it's just so powerful seeing these thingsI've read about come to life. Logan, Emma, and Ezra were amazing, aswell as the supporting cast. Emma's accent was somewhat detectable incertain parts, but even so she portrayed Sam so well. And Ezra was byfar the perfect Patrick, flamboyant, loud, and proud of it. Logan putso much emotion and heart into Charlie that I just wanted to reachthrough the screen and hug him. He truly was great. Anyone who lovesthe book as much as me will not be disappointed with the movie. Infact, if you're like me, you will want to see it again the second thecredits roll! I know one thing's for sure, as soon as "Perks" comes onDVD, this girl is snatching a copy quicker than you can say "Slut andthe Falcon"!
