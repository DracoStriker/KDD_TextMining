The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the best contemporary teen movieI've seen. The fact that it's about teens who overcome hard times inlife makes the plot's drama universal ? in Charlie's case, dealing withsexual abuse and depression. All of these issues surround us, but weregularly don't give a damn about it, and that's why this movie is soimportant. In the book, it is really explicit that Charlie was abusedwhen he was a kid and that was his trauma, but in the movie, this isonly a subtle reference. Since my mom works with children who werevictims of abuse and we watched it together, she pointed that out forme, because I didn't get it at first. Maybe that's the only flaw of themovie: not being so clear about that. Charlie also has a thing for this girl, Sam, and as their relationshipevolves we can see how young romance is just awful and difficult.That's a good thing as well, it's not one of those perfect high schoolromances that we're used to watching in movies. Oh, Emma Watson playsSam and she did great as an American girl.The soundtrack is fabulous, impeccable, brilliant! Couldn't love more.OK, not to drop spoilers, but in the end, when they're riding Patrick'svan with Heroes by David Bowie on the radio, all the lines and thedialogue are perfect ? everything works. Probably one of the best movieendings that I've ever seen. Just amazing.
