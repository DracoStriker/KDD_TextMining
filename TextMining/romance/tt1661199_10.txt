I'm not sure if I'm bias towards Disney films, but I personally thoughtthis movie was incredible. I could connect with Cinderella and thedesign was absolutely stunning. The dress was beautiful and I loved howCinderella changed from the beginning to the end but still held on toher values as a person. I also loved how I could understand theStepmother and why she does what she does. When I finished this moviethe message stayed with me. I don't usually like movies with "truelove" but this movie made it work. I would definitely recommend thismovie to anyone. Cinderella's motives were very clear and I was rootingfor her the entire movie
