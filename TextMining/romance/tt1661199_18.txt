Disappointing. A forgettable musical score. Even the oddly cast Disneymulti-cultural video is superior. As much as I like that production, Ibelieve that "Cinderella" has to be a fair-haired blue-eyed blonde!Other actors can be anything they wish! Good performances by all inthis 2015 "remake" so I can't quite figure out just what's missinghere. Walt Disney used to call it "heart". As a "film" collector, Ihave both versions of "R&H Cinderella" (which are both videos),Disney's animated classic, and "Ever After" with Drew Barrymore. Plus,I have seen "The Slipper and the Rose" as well. (It's also excellent,but it's a bit too operatic, with ballet dancing, for kids.) Here, bothher mom and dad die, mercifully, "off camera". The most redeemingquality is the great over-the-top Fairy Godmother pumpkin coach andanimal transformations (and after Midnight un-transformation). Where ismy "Bibbity-Bobity-Boo" song? Yes, the chattering mice, lizards andgoose are too cute and very well done. There is just not as muchsurprise here, as the Prince remembers meeting her in the forest andtherefore shouldn't have had that much trouble finding her? The newBeauty and the Beast movie (2016) is just so much more captivating and"alive". At least there is no "chunky" Fairy Godmother here. WhitneyHuston could barely squeeze into her costume, so many years ago!
