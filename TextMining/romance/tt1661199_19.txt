Kenneth Branagh did convinced us with a fresh retelling of thisDisney's 1950 masterpiece with a heart and soul.Lily James did a good job of portraying Cinderella, best part is CateBlanchett in which she delivered a stunning performance and at the sametime, can do scene stealing too.Still, there are flaws within this movie, they still need to conveymore depth as there are things in the movie, it get too cartoon.
