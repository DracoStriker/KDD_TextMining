Cinderella's Walt Disney Company version by Kenneth Branagh mightsuffer from the very rooted "heterossexualization" in stories, which Imust confess upsets me a little: there could be more diversity in thesematters, no matter the character's genders. However considering thewhole thing, when it comes to make a good work, I cannot deny itsexquisiteness. The cast is excellent, Cate Blanchett (the stepmother)never ceases to amaze me and this young lady Lily James surely knowshow to get the best of her natural glow: beautiful, charming andcharismatic, her talent grows beyond measure. As for the rest of thecast they are obviously just as great: Ben Chaplin (Ella's father) inspite of his little presence in the film totally strengthens the storywith his powerful voice and presence, Sophie McShera and HollidayGrainger (the evil stepsisters) sure know how to wear evilmagnificently, Richard Madden (the Prince) is more than just a prettyface in a hot body, showing his brains in his craft, and Nonso Anozie(the Captain), proving again his talent and energy, giving the film afresh sense of good and loyalty with his calm attitude and bad-assappearance. These to name a few.Other than that, the whole production work was just phenomenal:starting by the mind- blowing scenarios, fabulous props, make-up adhaircuts all the way to the deepening soundtrack and the smart choiceson the camera angles. As for the script, screenplay Chris Weitzbrutally shows his Trinity College, Cambridge English degree influenceby conferring the language a certain accuracy very to the taste of thetime that the story depicts.Some movies move you deeply, make you smile and cry and scream. Othersare mere entertainment. Very few manage to combine both.
