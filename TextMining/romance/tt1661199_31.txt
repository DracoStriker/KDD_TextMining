This story is veryinteresting, about Ella dropping the glass slippers and the ending ofthe story. This story is very well-known and popular until nowadays. Iseriously hate the stepmother and stepsisters so much because they liketo forces Ella to do the work, locks her in the room and gettingjealous on Ella. Anyways, this is the best story ever that i have seen.
