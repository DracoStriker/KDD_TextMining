Wow, I mean wow! How can a CARTOON be better, more EXCITING, ANDrelate-able than a live action re-telling?They took out the BEST elements of the cartoon, and REPLACED what wasleft with boring stuff. No more lovely music. No more actual talkinganimals. No more people existing that are not young models.....Brings me to my next point, no offense but Cinderella is ugly in thismovie. Her step sisters look better than her, hell her STEP motherlooks better. The woman prince Charming was supposed to marry lookedbetter. I mean is Disney trying to make a statement? It's what's on theinside that counts? Well, then why did they keep saying in the moviethat Cinderella was so beautiful?When they make actors say something that FORCED it's sad. Bad writingand casting. Did the costume department do the casting? Did they hirethis actress since her waist fit the dress? Did they hire the princesince he had thunder thighs? None of the main actors looked good. I'msorry they looked deformed....maybe I am so used to flawless moviestars....BUT if you are going to hire homely actors don't have peoplein the movie constantly pointing out how "handsome/beautiful" theyare.....Oh the rest.....well it was really boring. I doubt a 5 yo child wouldfind this entertaining. It was just so sad. Drek all the way as well.Disney is so desperate making this movie. I mean after they startedmaking Cinderealla 2, 3 etc...and other Disney movie sequels it was badenough. This is really bad a pointless WORSE remake.
