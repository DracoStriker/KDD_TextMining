I was disgusted by the disparaging portrayal of Cinderella in thisfilm, and the weak role model she represents to children. Throughoutthe film there were frequent times when Cinderella could have stood upto her step-sisters and step-mother who bullied her. But instead shetakes the rather dubious moral high-ground of "I must be kind andcourageous". Since when did being 'kind' equate to being a dupe and apush over? Of course it all works out well for Cinderella who isrescued by her fairy god mother and prince - a great lesson to teachour children...not. With her continual chatting to animals andair-headed behaviour I was inclined to believe that her step-sisterswere correct - Cinderella was a simpleton. At which point I lost allinterest and rather hoped the prince would marry the wicked step-mother, who at least had a backbone. The film ended with the surmisethat Cinderella was courageous (in case you had any doubts) as shefaced the prince without makeup and a flouncy dress on - well doneCinderella. I too can't bear to face a man without looking my utmostprettiest and best. Oh, one last thing Cinderella - if you had reallywanted to wear your dead mothers 'pink' dress to the ball, what wereyou thinking when you let the fairy godmother turn it into a bluemeringue? Oh sorry I forgot...you have to be "kind".
