I felt the story of Cinderella was was beautifully done. The acting wasjust as it should be for a fairy tale. The colours and the magicvibrant. The actors and actresses played their parts wonderfully.Taking a story and making it into a movie most times is difficult. Howwe have interpreted the story can be very different from what thedirector envisioned. As a lover of all fairy tales I enjoyed the movie. I believe all littlegirls and even grown ups like me can appreciate how well they did withthe movie.All in all it was well done.
