This film is quite simply awful. I cannot think of a single redeemingcharacteristic. The lead actress is terrible, I don't actually have thewords to describe her and the other characters are just as bad. How acompany like Disney who have made such masterpieces in the past couldget it so wrong and make this travesty is completely beyond me. I havealso never been a fan of Helena Bonham Carter, and her role in thisfilm completely justifies my feeling, she is an absolute freak. Do notwaste your time of your money on this rubbish! Young girls nowadaysneed positive empowering role models, they also need to believe thatthey can make their own dreams come true without the aid of idiotic,air headed notions and this film is about as backwards as you can get
