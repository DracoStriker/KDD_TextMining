After reading some of the other reviews and giving the film a chance tobe able to be rent-able, I picked it up last weekend to give it a shot.I do enjoy how Disney is re-working their animated classics and I forone am thrilled that they are doing so! I have been a fan of theanimated classics for years and years and am looking forward to seeingmany more re-makes. This film was light heart-ed, whimsical, fun,entertaining and mimicked the original feature, which is great.Everything about it was a joy to see. Would recommend it to those whoalready know that they do enjoy the Disney animated feature. Everythingin it was lovely, bright, and themed well.
