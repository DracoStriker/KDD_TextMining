The message from Cinderella is so so out-dated and dangerous. "Kind"doesn't mean "Weak". "Taking care of the house" is a very lame excuse.Cinderella was basically trapped in that house and abused by her stepmother without any resistance and fight. She has a horse and she can escape. I know it is a fair tale, but please make it logical and sends out thecorrect message to kids around the world about how to fight back thebully and abuse.If you want to make a NEW movie, make it New with new messages and newplots, otherwise leave it be.It is such a boring and uninteresting movie with nothing new. Pleasesave your money and time.
