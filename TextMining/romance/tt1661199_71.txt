I went into this, hoping for something more...grown-up in the way of aremake-retelling. Sort of how Maleficent was a remake-retelling ofSleeping Beauty; which I enjoyed a lot. BUT that is not what this was,to my great disappointment. I actually almost hated this movie afterwatching it the first time, because of that great disappointment, but Iknew better than that, and after waiting a while, letting it sit and"digest", I decided it was time to re-watch it and give it anotherchance with zero expectations. I wanted to give it a fair start, to tryand give it a more fair review. Still was not that all into it and somemy original thoughts in regards to certain things were still there. Itwasn't in the more serious and "realistic" vein of Ever After (starringDrew Barrymore, 1998) nor the cutesy, silly Ella Enchanted (starringAnne Hathaway, 2004). Ever After I have a fond spot in my heart for andstill pull the DVD out once in a blue moon to watch. Ella Enchanted, Icould at least mildly enjoy by getting a laugh at the humor sometimesand how it didn't take itself too seriously. At times, Cinderella didseem to try to be those movies here and there. The way her fatherpassed and his love was just for Ella and not the step-mother, wantingto go to the ball in her mother's gown, as well as a snide remark fromone the step-sisters to the other about being at the buffet table, werealmost straight from Ever After. There were cutesy, tongue-in-cheekmoments a couples times that were reminiscent of Ella Enchanted. Thismovie was neither of those.Full article will not fitArticle by: PyroluxAemilius of WoodBangers Entertainment
