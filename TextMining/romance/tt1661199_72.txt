First the good: Kenneth Branagh does it again, diversity in Hollywood.I loved seeing all of the people of non white heritage spattered aboutthe landscape as if they all belonged there. Coodles to Mr. Branagh foralways thinking outside the white box. Now the bad: The movie itself.This was the most boring thing I ever sat through and I think thateveryone in the small audience I was in (on discount day) thought thesame. Anytime people leave a theater without saying a word it's bad.The dialog was the worst I've ever heard, Lily James is also the worstactress I've ever seen. The saving grace was Derek Jacobi as the King.His relationship with his son was far more interesting thanCinderella's relationship with her entire family. Then there was theendless narration; doesn't Branagh know that the first rule ofstorytelling is "Show me, don't tell me". I guess he forgot in thisfilm. The landscapes were pretty but I got tired of the endless streamof colorful gowns that were way too big on the bottom. Then there wasthe endless "message" of the film. Yes it's a good message but a goodmessage doesn't make up for a bad film. As I quoted skip this and seeEver After is was so much better at telling the Cinderella story.
