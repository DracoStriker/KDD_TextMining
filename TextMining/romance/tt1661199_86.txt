In the 50s, Disney made an animated Cinderella who was painfully bland,a cardboard princess who meets a cardboard prince. But they havefinally made up for it with this live action version, which features acharming and fiercely sweet young lady played to the perfection by thepreternaturally glowing Lily James.The movie starts with Ella in happier days, and the early part of themovie involves seeing those happy days slip away. While I appreciatethe use of giving some context, I found these early scenes a bit slow.The movie picked up with the entry of evil stepmother Cate Blanchettand her odious daughters, but in spite of some lovely scenes, like thefirst appearance of the prince, I didn't really get drawn into themovie until the entry - heralding a stream of resplendent specialeffects, of Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother.Once the fantasy really gets going, though, the film becomes utterlyentrancing. The special effects are a small part of the movie but arebeautifully done. The ball is beautiful, the young couple in love areboth just so darn nice, the stepmother continually reaches for newlevels of awfulness, and I became deeply invested in the story.James makes a perfect modern-day Disney Princess, with typicalsweetness goosed with feistiness, and Carter makes a breezily quirkyfairy godmother. There's a little palace intrigue to round things out,along with a lot of pretty scenery.You should watch this movie.
