Cinderella is my favorite fairytale, so I had high hopes for this filmwhen I heard about it back in 2013 and after I saw the trailer I washyped and the film didn't disappoint.The things that make it stand out to the animated are you know aboutCinderella's childhood and her mother because in the original all youknow about her childhood is that her parents loved her, after hermother dies her father remarries another woman that has two daughters,but here you see Cinderella and her mother and fathers relationship,you know when they die and you see the stepmother and stepsisters walkin to Cinderella's life and ruin it after her father dies and the houseservants are laid off, the prince has a stronger character than in theoriginal and has a better relationship with Cinderella.Most of the performances are pitch perfect, Lily James as Cinderellawas likable, sweet and she had that angelic smile, Cate Blanchett asthe stepmother was devious and threatening, Richard Madden as theprince was likable and strong willing, Holiday Granger and SophiaMcshera as the stepsisters were also devious but funny especially whenDrizella tried to sing I laughed out loud in the theater the only onethat felt forced was Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother I meanshe did well for the part she played but she kinda acted like she wason a Tim Burton movie, being crazy and kooky but anyone could've beencast for this film and they had to choose this famous actress eventhough the parts she's played in other films have been good because I'msure no one knew about Lily James and she did great as the mainprotagonist, so they could've chosen anyone unknown and they had tochoose someone famous.Even though I loved this film, I had a few problems with it like whenCinderella's mothers pink dress is ripped apart it's just a rip fromone of the sleeves, a rip on the top fringe part of the dress and asmall rip from the skirt I mean she could've sewn it back in 20 minutesand have her fairy godmother make her stepmother and stepsisters notrecognize her at the palace because if you look at the animated DisneyCinderella her dress is completely ripped apart and she's wearing apiece of cloth just tattered around her, another problem I had with itwas when she's locked in the attic bedroom she doesn't care whathappens to her and starts singing and dancing, even though it was niceto have Lily James sing in an adaptation of Cinderella that wasn't amusical, but again in the original when she's locked in the bedroom shestarts banging on the door and tells her mouse friends to quickly getthe key before the duke leaves and the final problem I had with thisfilm is the representation of mice I mean they don't make them talk sowhen Cinderella is talking to these mice that don't talk I didn't knowif it was cute or creepy and made it look like her stepmother was goingto put her in insane asylum because again in the original film the micetalked and it kinda made sense for Cinderella to talk to the mice.So beside those small problems this has been my favorite film of 2015and is just as good as the original Disney Cinderella. So I recommendall Cinderella fans to see this adaptation of the Disney animated one.score 9/10
