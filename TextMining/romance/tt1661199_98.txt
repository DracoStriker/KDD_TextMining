I personally think it's unfair to bash on this film for being a"Cinderella" adaptation. Although a LOT of people know about thisclassic fairytale, they did a really good job of making a live actionversion of it. Now I personally like the Disney cartoon version better,but maybe that is due to the talking mouse and because of what I grewup watching. I will admit the first hour is very straight forward likethe fairytale book and the animated movies. But after the first hour orso, it does give a bit more insight on the mindset of certaincharacters. And delves more into the emotional and heart elements, likewhat makes the character tick and such. Which I thought wasinteresting, since this is one of my childhood fairy tales I grew upreading and listening to when I was a kid. This is a movie where theytried to make the Cinderella story come to life and I could tell theyput quite a lot of effort to make it the best adaptation possible. Soyeah, this might be boring for people that already know the completestory. But even if that is the case, it's still a movie that is worth awatch with the family.7.1/10
