I went to an awards screening of Les Miserables and left the cinemaspeechless. Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography, costumes,art design and editing are nothing short of genius.Hooper's idea to have the actors sing live really brings a deeperemotion to the film not seen in other movie musicals. Hugh Jackman isabsolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film withspectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role asFantine - the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral isone of the it's best moments, and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELTrendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.Also, a great supporting turn from newcomer Samantha Barks as theheartbroken Eponine (look out for her waist - it's absolutely tiny!),who is sure to be shot into stardom. Eddie Redmayne, Russell Crowe andAaron Tveit are also good, and there's some great comedy relief fromHelena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.It will leave you laughing, crying, and feeling inspired. A greatwatch, sure to win some major awards this year! 10/10!
