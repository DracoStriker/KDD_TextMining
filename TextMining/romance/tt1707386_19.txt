When so many people love this movie I get to thinking why am I so offtrack with my feelings about this musical. Maybe I just don't get it,maybe it's because I wasn't that familiar with the Broadway production,maybe it's because I went to this movie to be entertained....bigmistake. Now don't get me wrong, the production sets, acting, costumes,and big screen epic stature are all there, but what was missing was theemotional story and connection to the audience. I guess I knew thiswasn't for me about 10 minutes into this seemingly long slow movingmovie when I found I was already wondering how long until it would beover. Now I'll admit the only song I really knew going into this moviewas " I dreamed a dream" however, the endless non melodic off keyvocalization by the entire cast with the exception of Anne Hathaway inmy humble opinion simply ruined any chance this production would workfor me and those movie goers who were seeking a memorable story put tomusic. I like the 1998 movie production staring Liam Neesom so muchmore than this miserable attempt. Simply put this movie was a hugedisappointment, no in truth it STUNK...sorry but I call them as I seethem.
