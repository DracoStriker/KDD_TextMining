When I was a teenager, Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables" was the mostimpressive tale of injustice that I have ever read, with theheartbreaking story of Jean Valjean, a man arrested for stealing apiece of bread and haunted by the persistent and merciless InspectorJavert. Then I saw at least two great versions of this novel in the cinema, the1935 with Fredric March and Charles Laughton, and the 1998 with LiamNeeson and Geoffrey Rush in the roles of Valjean and Javert.I had the highest expectations with this musical, awarded with severalwins and nominations. Unfortunately this version does not develop thecharacter Jean Valjean and shows him after many years in forced laboras a thief, omitting the whole beginning of the injustice in the story.It is impossible to feel sympathy and pain for his suffering.There is more emphasis to the story of Fantine in the beginning andAnne Hathaway is excellent. However, Russell Crowe singing isunbearable; Hugh Jackman singing is boring and the songs are terribleand I stop watching the DVD of this pretentious version with 45 minutesrunning time. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): "Os Miseráveis" ("The Miserables")
