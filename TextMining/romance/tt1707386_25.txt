I must be getting old & cynical or both. I saw the actors listed andthought this has to be a great movie. It wasn't. I couldn't endure morethan 30 minutes, so perhaps it got better after I left. (I doubt it). Ilove a good musical. I also like it to have some dialogue mixed in aswell. When I realised the whole movie was going to be sung I started tocringe, no amount of delicious hot popcorn and gallons of coke wasgoing to keep me stuck in the seat. It's the WORST movie I have seen ina long long time and I have seen some shockers lately (WRONG as anexample). As I said in the header, Les Miserable is exactly how I feltwhen I walked out of the cinema after spending good money on utterrubbish. After I walked out I noticed many others quietly exiting thecinema.
