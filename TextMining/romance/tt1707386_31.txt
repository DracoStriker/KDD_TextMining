Epic, limb-numbing musical-infused version could possibly be thebiggest turkey I've seen this side of Christmas (it opened here onBoxing day so the analogy is relevant). Hugh Jackman seems like a tremendous stage actor, full of theexuberance and intensity needed for that medium, but for film, he'sconsistently over-wrought (in my opinion). Often his portrayal fails toconvince me, his expression becomes 'comfortable' looking, failing toexude that sense of despondency that Jean Valjean experiencesthroughout his life, the subject of the ruthless tyrant Javert's(Crowe) relentless pursuit and character assassination.Big Russ actually seems restrained, almost pensive in some respects andI was glad to see the make-up crew didn't give him a Bonaparte hair-do;Helena Bonham-Carter's, on the other hand, has the look of anelectrified troll doll - not to take away from her talents as athespian, but the look was truly maniacal.I reserve my most ardent criticism for Anne Hathaway. "The Devil WearsPrada" suited her style, whereas she doesn't seem "mature" enough forthis role, she always looks adolescent, her porcelain skin defying therigours of her character's desperate predicament.If perchance you're a fan of the epic film-musical set to battle hymns,then this version of "Les Mis" might pique your interest once more. Forme, I'm content to stick with Richard Jordan's more inspired JeanValjean from the seventies.
