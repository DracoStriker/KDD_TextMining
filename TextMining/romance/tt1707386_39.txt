Dear Mr Hooper, First of all, thank you for a near-perfect film.However, if you want to be all trendy and not use tripods then that'sup to you of course, but having the cinematographer shake the cameraabout ON PURPOSE is distracting, over-rated and looks amateur. Actuallyperhaps I'm being too harsh here...on amateurs. No amateur cameramanthat I've seen, jostles his instrument about deliberately, to furtherexaggerate the "hand-heldness" of the camera! Why would he? He knowsit'll be annoying and possibly nauseating to his viewers. So he trieshis best to keep it still...but we can still tell it's hand-held. Andwe can tell this very easily because we are NOT COMPLETELY STUPID.You wanted a live feel and so you mic'ed up the actors on set andfilmed and used long takes. Brilliant. Awesome. I have never seen orheard better singing performances on the silver screen. Like I saidinitially, this movie was near-perfection for me. I've been to thecinema twice to see your film, (though the second time I sat way back,)and I shed a tear in the same places both times.You wanted a live feel so you had your cinematographer man-handle thecamera into the faces of the actors. Commendable. It's okay not to usetripods. But having the camera bouncing around even more, not onlydraws attention to the cinematographic hardware, but also to the factit's being deliberately mishandled. That detracts from the subjectmatter, and we don't need it thanks. We're trying to look through thiswindow into the world you've created, so stop flipping-well shaking thewindow about!Yours sincerely, Regular Movie-goer.
