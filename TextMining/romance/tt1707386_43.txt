This film is stunning! As one who cried through most of the stage show,I wondered if this would have the same effect. It did! Anne Hathaway's'I Dreamed a Dream' is heartbreaking, she did it beautifully, and HughJackman's voice is fabulous. Amanda Seyfried has the sweetest, purestvoice and Eddie Redmayne played a dashing Marius. People had mentionedin reviews that the camera work was a little odd but I thought itconveyed the feeling of being on the stage, where we tend to lookdirectly at the person singing, so I had no problem with it at all. Theweakest link, for me, was Mr Crowe whose voice was poor next to theothers. Had he not been alongside so many fantastically strong singersit may not have been so noticeable but, sadly, he fell a little flat incomparison. This is my first review as I felt so strongly about it Ijust HAD to write one! GO AND SEE IT! IT'S AMAZING!
