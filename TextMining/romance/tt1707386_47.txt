Les Miserables is possibly one of the best musicals ever written and upon the silver screen kids of every age can enjoy it! Of course thereare certain critiques; The beginning feels kind of rushed, Valjean'searly life kind of just flies by. The characters Fantine and Eponine'sstories are a bit rushed as well and they each lose pieces if notentire songs but the point they are supposed to make is still relayed.The music is just as powerful as it was in the play or the concerts,and the acting was phenomenal. Anne Hathaway is a shoo in for victorywhen the Oscars role around. These new takes on the characters are asrefreshing as a cool drink of water on a hot summer's day; They let yousee different and new characteristics of their personalities (such asFantine's hate or Cosette's resentment.) You cry at every turn withthis movie, ten minutes in your tears are prickling your eyes and halfan hour in you've completely succumb to the suffering and anguish ofthese wonderful characters. If you are watching this in the comfort ofyour home you cannot help but start to sing along to all of yourfavorite tunes. (I know I was having trouble remaining silent in thetheater.) The costume designs were gorgeous (even though some might saythat some of the female characters were heavily under-dressed for thetimes) as the red, blue and even grays of the movie catch your eye andyou find yourself sitting back trying to take it all in, wanting everylittle detail to remain safe in your memory. This movie was well puttogether and very well casted as none of the cast disappoints in theirportrayal of these infamously famous characters. Special props go tothe newcomers to the silver screen Samantha Barks, Isabelle Allen andDanielle Huttlestone who definitely held their own with the seasonedactors of Hollywood. This movie gets nine stars out of ten because theyleft out some catchy songs, it could have been twenty minutes longerand because no movie is perfect.
