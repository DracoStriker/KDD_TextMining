I've never written a review here, and I may never again. I felt theneed to make my disappointment known, however, so here I am now.Rather than write something new, I'm simply going to copy/paste what Iwrote on a social site, bad grammar and all:I saw this movie today and it's probably the largest disappointmentI've experienced. Ever. Well, in the realm of "Cool-things-I'm-looking-forward-to", that is. I didn't even make it through the entire film,walking out after an hour or so.I never had the chance to see the Broadway play, but was introduced tothe music by my parents years ago when they brought home the castrecording after attending a performance during a vacation trip. Formany reasons, I fell in love with it. Needless to say, with theannouncement of the upcoming movie, I was excited to see this greatmusical come to life for me.Sadly, though, there was nothing musical about it. The wonderful, andpowerful, music by Schonberg and Boublil was utterly decimated by thedirector and cast. The majority of the blame, though, has to go to thedirector. His choice of a "raw" and live approach to the singing was amistake and I don't know what the hell he was thinking. I could hearsome talent from some of the cast, no doubt, but no where near thelevel needed to pull off the approach taken by Tom Hooper. Not evenclose. And, the poor singing was all I could hear: the score itself wasso poorly mixed that the music was completely lost to the singing.Our dear director gave us the emotion, tragedy and insight expectedfrom Les Miserables, but he forgot the music.Horrible. 0 out of 10. Everything else accomplished by this film isentirely wiped out and made irrelevant by the inexcusably poor musicand vocal performances.What a let down...
