I don't regret much in my life. I've done lots of things I would rathernot have done but at least can say it was an experience and I'velearned something. Last night I watched Les Miserables and it was a dire experience fromopening ridiculously over the top scene to the drawn out (for god'ssake just die!!) scene at the end. I came out thinking "i've just losttwo hours of my life that I'll never get back.If just one of the actors could sing it would have been some blessedrelief but apart from he chorus there wasn't a single a singleredeeming voice in the cast. Where is Susan Boyle when you need her ?From Hugh Jackmans wondering accents to the little boy on thebarricades doing his artful dodger impression and Amanda Sefreidwarbling like an anaemic canary this "musical" was a travesty.Surely when you are casting a musical the requisite should be forsingers who can maybe act and not actors who think they have a bit of asinging voice in the shower.Les Mis is my favourite all time musical but no-one in there wildestdreams would consider buying the sound track to this hack job.To be fair my wife said it was OK but even she got bored towards theend and there were a few boxes of hankies being used around me but itwouldn't do if we were all the same , would it.
