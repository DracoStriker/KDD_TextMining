Truly awful, poorly paced, film adaptation of a musical. Bad direction,cinematography, sets, costumes. The miniatures of Paris lookedhorrible. The sets looked cheap. No wonder the entire thing was shot ina series of nauseating close-ups. I like Hugh Jackman but If this isthe performance of a lifetime he may need a couple more lifetimes tomake up for it. He suffered from frame one to the dismal end and so didthe audience. Worse was Russell Crowe who managed to look constipatedfor the entire film. And newsflash: He can't sing! Anne Hathaway cansing but she can't act. Why did they bother hiring Helena Bonham Carterand Sacha Baron Cohen? They did nothing but mug in ugly costumes andwigs. Maybe the director thought it was a remake of Sweeney Todd? Threeperfumers stood out: Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Samantha Barks asEponine and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. Poor Amanda Seyfried. She isthe best part of two of the worst musicals of all time - this one andMama Mia!
