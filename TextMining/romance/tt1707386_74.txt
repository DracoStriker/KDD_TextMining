I've never been a big fan of musicals. I was recently introduced tothis story via some earlier movie versions and began reading the book.Regardless of adaptation, the story is a great one. It is a critique ofman's ways and a story of redemption(s).I found this adaptation to be very "human". Actors are shown with allflaws showing, and many added for the roles being played. The singingwas great at times, flawed at others, but a good mix of the two. Againit was nice to keep the human aspect intact with the singing. It waseasy to connect with the characters due to the visual and audiblehumanness about them.I found Eddie Redmayne's performance to be one of the best - heportrayed his characters emotion on his face and in his voice - and inhis eyes - nicely. I'm surprised to not hear more about hisperformance.Most of all, Les Miserables is a great story! It is food for thought, asocial commentary, and at the same time entertaining. If you are notfamiliar with it as i was until recently, i highly recommend checkingit out - again, for the amazing story on it's own.
