I am quite frankly flabbergasted at the amount of positive reviews byviewers and professional critics given to this movie. I do not rememberthe last time that an audio-visual experience inflicted me with so muchpain, both mentally and physically. I think my theatre seat still hasindentations from me clutching the chair frantically throughout themovie. I felt like the Clockwork Orange protagonist when he's tied downto a chair and fed those nauseating stimuli (the main difference beingthat he got to listen to some quality music in the process). It isprobably the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot ofhubris in my time.The review by MouthyMatthew summarises it the best. Over the top.Chords and themes excruciatingly repetitive (How possibly wouldn't theybe? I mean, every line in a 159 minute movie has been "sung", down tothe most banal mundane statement you can imagine.). The moviesuccessfully drains your life energy as it progresses, since you haveto employ a supernatural effort to stick with the characters' lines. What would be a series of seemingly important storyline details ends upreceiving a very cursory treatment. For instance, Fantine's tragic lifetrajectory. Furthermore, why on earth would they hire Hollywoodbigshots with a singing talent of a sexually frustrated walrus to playthese parts?? And the accents, oh, for the love of god. What the hell?Overall impression: laughably sappy (yet unconvincing) and above allinsufferable.In my humble opinion, I think people should not see this movie if theyhave not been exposed to the story earlier, by reading the book orseeing a good musical production of it. I truly hate that this will bemy first impression of both the story and the characters, the one thatI will always be stuck with.
