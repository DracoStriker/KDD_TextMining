The very start of the movie intrigued me, the care taken into thedetail from costume to language was picture perfect, and being a hugefan of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, this was a treat for me. A musical is not what i usually prefer but i would have kicked myselffor the rest of my life if i had missed this on the big screen. thismovie brought out the rawest emotions of men, and why we end up doingthings we aren't proud of. the voice score was shocking,Anne Hathawayshook me up. The words were simple yet used to deliver the perfectemotion.On the whole, i'm still in trance after watching the movie, and notmany movies bring a tear to my eyes. this one had me fighting themback. loved it.
