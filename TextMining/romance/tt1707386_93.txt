As a man, I most certainly did NOT cry through the whole of LesMiserables because that would be weak and unmanly. Ahem. This is a filmdeserving every nomination and win it is receiving. It is a nearperfect blend of the musical, and the book. I think its a blazingexample of how to turn a musical into an emotionally charged film thatdelivers sterling performances from all the actors involved, withoutbeing limited by the strict confines of music. It goes beyond anymusical I have seen as a movie, virtually creating a genre in itself.Hugh Jackman's voice strongly contrasts against the traditional ColmWilkinson - but his acting is fantastic, and I got used to his voice. Ithought that Russel Crowe did a far better job than critics have beenattempting to persuade me. Naturally Anne Hathaway's performance isheart-rending, and equalled by Samantha Barks.I highly recommend seeing this - if you are a fan of the book ormusical you will enjoy everything that film brings to an adaptation,and if you have never heard of either - then this an easily accessibleway of seeing one of the greatest tales in literature, and in music.
