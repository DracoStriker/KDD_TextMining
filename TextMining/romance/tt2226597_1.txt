This ridiculous film was unmistakingly one of the worst films i've seenin 30 years! Kate Winslett needs to return to acting school, she justisn't very convincing. Here are these two souls who end up in thesnowy, blizzard mountains due to a plane crash and never once did ihear either of them say "I'm cold". They prance thru the snow so easilyand of course as time goes on they began to give each other goo goo gahgah looks like teenage heart throbs. It appears it's extremely cold yetthey can hardly wait to jump in the sack. I could hardly wait for thisClunker to be finished. PLease do not waste your time on thisfilm....it's absolutely horrible!
