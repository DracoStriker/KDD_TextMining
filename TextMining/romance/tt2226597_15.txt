I suppose one goes to the cinema with the anticipation that onesdisbelief will need to be switched off, at least for some aspects ofthe story. But here we asked to believe that two people and a dogsurvive a major air crash in the Rocky Mountains in January. The crashis graphic in its detail that, somehow, first the tail is knocked off,then a wing, before the remains slide to a halt on a convenientplateau, with petrol dripping from somewhere. I'm afraid that lazydirection pervades the film throughout, with countless more examples atevery feeble plot twist. Nothing is too difficult, everything easilyachieved, we are left wondering why we should bother watching to theend as, clearly, the three will make it home, overcoming the slight andpredictable odds against them on the way. There was one dismallyartificial twist just before redemption, involving a bear-trap, thathighlighted the desperation of the writers and director to inject alittle tension. The only actor that was not sleepwalking through thefilm was the dog(s), Beau Bridges cameo at the start was just bad, andit went downhill from there. There was no tension or chemistry betweenIdris Elba and Kate Winslet, the script and direction gave them noleads as to how to ramp up their dynamic. They might just as well havebeen cardboard cut-outs set up in front of the truly magnificentscenery. I went hoping to have an evening's entertainment in thecompany of two great actors, sadly they were on part throttle and thedirector had his foot firmly on the brake.
