Other than the scenery and the dog this movie is horrible, almostunbearable. The plot is so far-fetched it's silly. It's one of thosemovies that you know how it will end 5 minutes into it. I left thinkingI'd wasted $23.00. Like another reviewer posted the river scene couldhave never happened. The sex scene in the cabin (the two hadn't had abath or running water in how many days) almost sickening. Other thanthe dog and the scenery this movie doesn't have one redeeming quality.
