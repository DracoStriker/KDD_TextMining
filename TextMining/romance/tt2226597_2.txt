Not a totally horrible movie, but not great. I can't say much more thanhas already been said, but there were some errors the size of a Macktruck in this movie that have not been pointed out.1. There is a storm severe enough to cause commercial airplanes to begrounded, yet a small private plane can fly.2. Alex is getting married the next day, Ben is doing surgery the nextday, yet they are both across the country.3. Conveniently for the plot, the pilot doesn't file a flight plan.4. The plane crashes in the mountains, yet the passengers survive withminor injuries. I'll forgive this one, only because without it, themovie would be ten minutes long.5. The damsel in distress injures her leg, and conveniently, Ben is asurgeon.6. They crash in the Rocky Mountains at an altitude that's abovetimberline, at the end of December, without proper clothing and food,and don't die of hypothermia.7. Alex tells Ben to use her camera with a telephoto lens to get aclose up view around them. It is a rangefinder camera, and thus theviewfinder doesn't enlarge the view.8. Ben slides several hundred feet down a snow slope, and is stopped byhitting a conveniently placed low rock ridge which stops him from goingover a cliff, yet doesn't break both his legs.9. Alex falls through ice into a stream, yet is not carried downstreamso that Ben can fish her out.10. They finally find a cabin, which was built and furnished (includinga piano) with no road near it.11. Ben steps in a bear trap. It's possible that a trapper neglected topick up the trap, but not likely. Bears are hibernating that time ofthe year.On the plus side, there is adventure, romance, and some fantasticscenery. And a dog that steals the show.
