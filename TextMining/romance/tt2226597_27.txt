Whilst most of us are fortunate enough to have not experienced a planecrashMany of us have been camping and general living out doors. So we know,in a relatively short time, without washing amenities etc, you get abit grubby. So by the time Elba & Winslet are getting all amourous after 3 weeksliving in the wreckage it is truly remarkable how clean and hygienicthey were Another wonder was the amazing mountain views and Elba's perfectlychoiffered beard. Truly remarkable beard, always perfect in everyscene, it must be guaranteed plane crash proof Another, in a long list of recent films, illustrating how stunningviews and cinematography are not a substitute for a good script. Would I watch it again? Naa ! 5/10
