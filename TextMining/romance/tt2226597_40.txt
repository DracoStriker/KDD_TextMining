What can I say? I really liked this movie of two disparate strangerssuddenly cast into a crisis where they are entirely dependent on oneanother for survival and to get to safety. Elba and Winslet performedmagnificently in this movie about the rigors of surviving in themountainous winter wilds when their pilot has the poor manners to dieof a heart attack and crash their plane. It was really tacky of him.The dog, unnamed throughout, really deserves an Academy Award too. Idon't want to give away spoilers, so I won't, but it's not only a movieabout them surviving, but a movie about what these two find insidethemselves to hold onto. Wonderfully done, but (I know the movie ran abit long by today's standards) they really should've fleshed out morethan they did in the last half-hour of this one. It's well worth thetime to see it!PTH
