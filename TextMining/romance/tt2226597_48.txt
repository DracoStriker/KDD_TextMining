In "The Mountain Between Us," two attractive strangers played by IdrisElba and Kate Winslet agree to split the cost of a charter when theirairline transportation is cancelled due to an impending storm. Aftertheir pilot suffers a fatal stroke and the plane crashes in Utah'smountaintop wilderness, the two travelers despite sustaining seriouswounds must rely on instinct, determination, and each other to survivethe environment and find their way back to civilization."The Mountain Between Us" begins to lose any sense of credibilityshortly following its horrendously realistic plane crash?after buryingthe pilot in the mountain's permafrost and still using the destroyedplane's fuselage for shelter against the deadly wintertime elements,Winslet at one point deploys subterfuge to send Elba outside while shebrushes her teeth and primps. It's then that the watchful viewerrealizes the picture is less "Man in the Wilderness" than "A Man and aWoman."Based on a novel by Charles Martin and adapted to the screen by ChrisWeitz and J. Mills Goodloe, "The Mountain Between Us" is being billedas "a romance-survival-adventure film." But the picture might be moreaccurately described as a melodrama, and later even something close toa soap opera, particularly as the two actors descend below themountain's tree-line and the scenery transforms almost instantly frombleak arctic wilderness to an idyllic, Eden-like Thomas Kinkadepainting.Still, in spite of predictability and a number of continuity issues?Winslet's wounds in particular seem to wax and wane in severity?"TheMountain Between Us" ultimately becomes both an effective source ofentertainment and a fairly engrossing two-hour journey. Directed byHany Abu-Assad and filmed on spectacular locations in British Columbiaand Alberta, Canada, the picture succeeds on the strength of theperformances of Kate Winslet and Idris Elba.The actors invest so much personality into their characters that beforelong it becomes unthinkable to the audience that either of them mightnot survive their ordeal. And when it seems apparent that the two willbe able to overcome their predicament and rejoin civilization, itbecomes equally unthinkable that they won't eventually fall into eachother's arms.But although "The Mountain Between Us" might actually be too accurateto the Charles Martin source material and therefore continue too longafter the plot's nominal resolution, Winslet and Elba are talented,charismatic, and attractive enough to make us want to accompany them tothe end of their journey?even after we know where they're going.
