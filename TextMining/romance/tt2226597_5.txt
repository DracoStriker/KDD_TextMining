Rarely do I find myself so moved by a movie. So I was pleasantlysurprised. This movie offered a lot for adults that enjoy great acting,amazing cinematography, and scripts that make us think about what itmeans to live, love, fear, and overcome the seemingly impossible. Ifound myself mesmerized by the chemistry between the two maincharacters and how they experienced different feelings while beingpresent in the exact same circumstance. It's an incredibly compellingstory. I don't think a love story of this kind has ever been made. Asfar as the bad reviews go, I'm convinced that most of the peoplewriting bad reviews and giving low ratings, NEVER saw the movie andhave an agenda. Do you remember how people reacted to the infamousinterracial Cheerios commercial? Well the same thing is happening here.The truth is that the movie is excellent and should be nominated forBest Picture. I'd even see it again. The ending is one of the best Ihave seen.
