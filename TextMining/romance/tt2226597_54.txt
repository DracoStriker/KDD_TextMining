I'll start by saying I'm huge Idris fan. I never got into The Wire butI'm die-hard when it comes to Luther. I believe he's truly one of themost gifted actors working right now. Never been a huge Winslet fan. Iwas too young to care when Titanic came out and even when I gotolder..the super sappy never appealed to me. However I really enjoyedher in this.Now I've scene at least two butt hurt baby d**k white boys on herecomplaining about how they don't want to see an Interracialrelationship. My guess is they're Russian hackers who have never seenthis film and are only trying to stoke some racial arguments. A trueracist wouldn't have seen this film in the first place and moreoverwouldn't come on here to comment.Now back to the review: I loved Idris and Kate together and theirchemistry was clear as day. BUT--the script did them a true disservice.It was weak and generic. This is now the second time i feel Elba hasbeen shortchanged by the material. The Dark Tower was worse than awfuland I can;t believe his reps read this and convinced him to do it.Seriously man, fire your team! You deserve better pal.I give this a 10 because im a huge fan of actors that can elevate crapmaterial.
