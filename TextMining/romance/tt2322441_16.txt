One must ask, how is it possible that a movie company would bother toadvertise such a disgusting movie. I consider myself fairlysophisticated, however this is not entertainment .This is not a sign ofbeing in with the times. This is not art or a venue for good acting.This is pure filth, violence and an offense to women. This movie and Iuse the term loosely is worse than porn ,as it advertises itself as amain stream movie. At least with porn you know what your getting. Thisis the worst I've seen, because former sex torture movies, remainedwith the horror genre ,where they belonged. Disgusted is how I feltabout this movie, and ashamed at the hype given it.
