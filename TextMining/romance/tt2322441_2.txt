Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with oneof my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she hadenjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number ofyears ago. We paid our money and we took our seats. The film began; and I have tosay that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue,the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all justTOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear tittersfrom the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within thestory that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us Ihasten to add)...We gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said"Do you think there's any chance they will give us our money back??What do you think to it?" -- and thank God she replied, "Oh thankHeavens you said that; I can't stand it another minute! Lets just getoutta here!!!!!!! It's just terrible".We got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book andthat we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie,and hey presto they refunded my credit card! No questions asked! I give this rubbish 1 star; and that was for the pretty outdoorscenery! Don't waste your time with it -- it is Hollywood at it's worst.
