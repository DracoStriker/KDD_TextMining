First of all this is just an upgrade of the awful 70's soft porn RainMac brigade. Why they would want to make a film with this crassmaterial is beyond me. I suppose when so many sexually insecure peopleare buying the stupid not very well written book or reading it, thiswas bound to happen. This film is lame from start to finish, patheticscript. Why these actors got involved in this is a mystery , as it willnot enhance their career one bit. It's a cheap version of 9 1/2 weekswhich in itself tells you all you need to know , and all you sexuallyfrustrated people do not waste your money on this rubbish. As I onlywent to see what all the fuss was about and in my mind it was worstthan I expected a lot worst. Funny how people are like lemmings andjump on band wagons with all the hype. This film as been promoted tothe hilt and because of the pre sales are high. As soon as those presales have gone to watch it this movie will be put on to DVD's and endup in the bargain basement of the pound shop
