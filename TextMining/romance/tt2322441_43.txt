I sit here with my head in my hands, as i now have to relive the twohours of my life that i wasted on watching this 'film'. I don't quiteknow how i can put across how bad this film is. My most accuratesynopsis is that if you've ever watched a porn film, there will usuallybe (so I'm told ;-)) a terrible ten minute build up containing terribleacting, cheesy lines, and non believable attraction between thecharacters...imagine that for two hours and you have Fifty Shades ofGrey in a nutshell. The whole affair just seems to fade into one longboring series of encounters, with very little substance to the story,and the supposedly 'steamy' scenes are about as arousing as a flash ofyour school dinner ladies drawers. The lad can act but his Americanaccent is terrible and much like the book, the script is horrendous, heshould sack his agent. the female lead is attractive but again i justdon't buy that she would be attracted to the male, and if the film isbased upon their fascination with each other, then it leaves youwondering why the hell you're sat there...you actually don't care ifthey get together.Its one of those films that just doesn't grab you from the start and itultimately fails to pick up throughout, make no mistake, had it been atall possible, i would have left after 10 minutes, but i think mygirlfriend (who also found it appalling), would maybe have scowled atwasting the money.Ill sign off with this: WOMEN: wait for the DVD, spend the admissionmoney on a steak for your man, he will appreciate it more. MEN: At any cost, fake illness ,death,self inflicted loss of limb, getyourself out of watching this absolute dross!
