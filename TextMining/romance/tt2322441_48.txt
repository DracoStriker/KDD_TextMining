Let's say you did something wrong with your wife and she's reallyupset. Now you have to make it up to her, so she wants you to eitherspend a lot of money buying her a huge bunch of red roses.... or, shewants you to "suffer" for an evening.If you go for the first one, you'll just spend some money and your lifewill be back to normal within five minutes.If you choose the second option, you'll sit for two hours at the cinemawatching this movie. It's the first time in my life that someone wokeme up at the cinema. Now, about the move:- the main actors are just wrong for the character the play. He can'tplay a dominant role; maybe in a gay relationship in a comedy. Andher!!! Why on Earth would they pick a woman with no sex appeal at all.She's plain flat (in terms of personality). The Chemistry between thesetwo might be the same one as between myself and the bus driver from anyrandom route in any city around the world.- the story: I haven't read the books, but if it's based on them, I'dthink that the writers should have an easy enough job. So, maybe theyjust used Kelly Marcel's name but she actually didn't do any work? Iknow that she's a real professional, so I don't understand how she gotherself involved with a movie with basically no story. Really, nothinghappens. We could do a 10 minutes version and nothing important wouldstay out of it.- action (that is "sex"): well, let's say that we (men) come to seethis movie with our wives/girlfriends thinking that at least we'll getto see some sex on a main theater. That'll be the case only if you'reinto sex with very young women, so young that you'd need to ask for anID to make sure you don't get into any trouble. What you find is a manwith lots of sexual experience and a woman with zero experience and abody that looks more like that of a 15 years old girl than a woman inher 20s.So, big NO NO NO NO.Even my wife was disappointed with the movie.Guys around the world: go and buy 50 red roses and no cinema ticket!!!
