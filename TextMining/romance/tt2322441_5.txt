You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The book wasunquestionably the worst piece of writing I'd ever encountered, so whatthe hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from thetedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together withhollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and cliché,a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictablescenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout thefilm that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home(but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation witha stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book.Woeful film. Don't waste your money on this drivel. There are FiftyReasons to STAY AWAY.
