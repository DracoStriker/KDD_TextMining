I read the book two days before the release of the film as the hype wasquite huge. After reading the book I had no desire to watch the film.I've read far better executed fan fictions with more passion andemotions than this essentially 'GREY' book. But still went and watched the film and honestly out of all the FiftyShades of Grey franchise the trailer was the best. The film isessentially awkward and cringe worthy throughout it and it isn't aromance novel/film. It's a very disturbing film of a naive young womenfalling for a "control freak". Nothings screams passion in either thebook or the film!!
