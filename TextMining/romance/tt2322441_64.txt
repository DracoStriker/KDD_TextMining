As a woman who is not rarely into this kind of movie genre. I decidedto just go and watch he movie with higher expectations though, butafter watching it, i couldn't even go through the movie for 30 minute,I started getting bored and sleepy. In my opinion, from the beginningof the movie to the end, there was lack of chemistry between both theactors.though the music was good, but the the acting was like moreamateur style. the whole domination thing was beyond a joke....notkidding, as i know how BDSM works, wanted to see a little bit of strongchill than just a whipping. ...anyway. Would ever watch this movieagain, sorry no, but i will never forget for wasting my hard workedmoney to the cinema. oh, well...gotta read the book, maybe it's muchbetter.
