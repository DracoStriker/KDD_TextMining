What is going to be next? a movie about pedophilia, that make suchpractice cool, I feel that what now is in fashion is to make any bookseries into a movie, does not matter how good the book is, HarryPotter, Divergent, etc. I remember a lot of movies that depicted thiskind of sexual practice, comedies an horror movies. What really worriesme is that there is going to be a 2nd, and a 3d movie about thistrash,are we a society that only cares about having sex and gettinghigh?,this kind of movies make me think about converting to Islam. Notall book series should be transformed into a movie, or at least not acommercial ones, make no sense. (SPOILER ALERT!!!!)This movie is plainstupid.
