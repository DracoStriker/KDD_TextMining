First off the leads are just terrible. Worst picks possible. Plain asday and THE worst actors. No wonder wring leads were chosen. Look atthe sorry excuse for "producers" chosen, the author became anegotistical sellout and director and screenwriter don't know what theyare doing. Luke Grimes as Elliott & Rita Ora as Mia were also horriblymiscast. The two "leads" acting are so atrocious it turned this into acomedy. They have no sex appeal and zero chemistry. It's like seeingtwo dry pieces of wood put together and forced to be romantic. Dornan'sacting and delivery of lines is so horrid it makes me cringe. Dakota'sattempts at trying to be sexy and vulnerable fall way flat. This neededto be put into better hands. People who could have taken a poorlywritten book and actually made something better out if it. Even thoughbook is just corny erotic Twilight fan fiction, i mean, the "author"did not even bother to hide it. Each character is a clear and directrip off if every Twilight character. Terrible in every way. Thesoundtrack is only good thing about this and you don't even have tolike books or crap film to love it. I recommend buy the soundtrack anddon't waste your money on this waste of film. The only ones who willwatch and only ones who will give thumbs down are psycho cult fans.Ones who still live in parent's basements. And would not know goodliterature or a good love story if it were in their face. Books arecrap and world don't need sequels. One turd is enough.
