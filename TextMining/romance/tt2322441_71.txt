I saw a lot of bad reviews of this movie and of course that i didn'tthought it will impress me too much...i even had a few doubts anddidn'tknew if to go or wait too see it home..this afternoon i went to see itwith my husband and a girlfriend which read the book recently. First ofall i must say that i liked very much the actors , and the storyimpressed me very much,i heard the book is most beautiful than themovie,but i think all the books are like that..is very hard totransform a book into a movie,very hard to find the actors who suitsvery well and i appreciate very much the effort of the entireteam,especially the effort of the actors which tried to play verywell...i think the other 2 parts will be more beautiful and i can'twait to see them..congratulation,i think it is a successful movie andvery interesting,at least for me!
