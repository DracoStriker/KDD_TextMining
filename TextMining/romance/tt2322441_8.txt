"Fifty Shades of Grey" is based on a badly written book, so why someonethought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. ActuallyI don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, theproducers just wanted the money that would come in from all people whofor reasons known only to themselves read the book.I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it.Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We nolonger know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but inThe Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocritybeing considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands toreason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sadlevel. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there arepeople complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have cometo accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, onehad to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in thefantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just aboutanything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn'tfulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has awild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast youcan get out of the theater.There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, andfrom what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got theirmoney back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie inthe middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've beengoing to movies longer than a lot of you.I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for thebest. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker.What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first gradelevel and the resulting bad movie.
