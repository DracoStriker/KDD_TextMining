I normally start my reviews by naming the cast, the characters theyplay and the plot, but this "movie" doesn't deserve even that, so let'sjust jump into it all at the same time.Dakota Johnson plays Anastasia Steele, a young English LiteratureStudent who's incredibly superficial, self-loathing, insecure, hatesherself, and is a unrealistically to the point of ridicule.Anyhow, she meets Christian Grey, a 27 year old incredibly handsome CEOwith a defined six-pack and an athlete's body who's also a genius, ahumanitarian, and a helicopter pilot (the only thing he doesn't do isfly like a Superhero or they're keeping that for the sequel, I don'tknow), but he has a very dark side to him that comes from a place ofpain.Anastasia immediately falls in love with Christian in 5 seconds fromthe moment she meets him and apparently so does he, but like thetypical "dark but handsome, half good-half bad" cliché he tells her to"stay away from him, that he's bad for her." Yet the very next day hesends her first editions of an English novel, and then he rescues herfrom a creepy friend of hers that wants to be more than friends cliché.A character that like many others serve a 2 minute purpose for the"story" (and I'm using the term loosely), and then disappear for therest of the film, no development and no real purpose to even exist inthe "story" but put there just to fill time slots.As the ridiculous plot moves along, they grow closer together but hesays they can't have sex until she signs a binding contractsurrendering her will to him, because his "dark secret" is that he is aBDSM fanatic, a control freak in the bedroom, but he disobeys his ownrule when she reveals she's a virgin (this is when it turns evencampier and even more cheesy, if that's humanly possible), and when hetells her that many men might have wanted her in the past, she respondsin typical cheesy matter that "she has never desired anyone before".And so they have traditional sex. So we're now led to believe that thisyoung and attractive woman (despise the best effort of the writers tomake her look sloppy) has remained a virgin all these years, but within2 weeks of meeting this guy she just has sex with him, like that.After that, he gives her the contract she has to sign, and they try toloosely explain some sexual acts and toys and artifacts. Anyone whoknows the slightest thing of BDSM (Bondage and Discipline, Sadism andMasochism) know that this is a consensual form of role play that isbased on trust and bonding, and respect for one another, while thismovie shows BDSM as a form of consensual torture, since it is not basedon respect but on getting off on making people suffer and cause thempain. Besides of his redundant efforts for her to sign the "contract" (thatis mentioned every 5 minutes of the second half), she decides she needsmore time to think about it but they have sex regularly and even trysome BDSM scenarios that he specifically said would not happen unlessshe signed the contract.In typical clichés he tries to justify his sickness on a horriblechildhood and despite the fact they are too different they madly fallin love with each other as they try to find a middle ground, this iswhen the romance is exaggerated even by fairy tale standards.He says that she wouldn't understand his darkest side and she demandshe showed her, and when he accepts his big secret is that he gets offon making other suffer excruciating pain, not causing any form ofpleasure but pain (something that was obvious from the beginning). Uponseeing he is a sicko she leaves him, the end. This movie is astoundingly bad, in poor taste, with no characterdevelopment, with cartoon characters that in no way show real people,with no knowledge of actual BDSM practices, filled with clichés fromthe beginning to the very end.This is easily one of the worst movies ever made, the fact that it wasmade can kill the love of movies. It almost odes that to me.
