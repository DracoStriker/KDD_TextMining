Once again, Emilia Clarke does not disappoint. The acting truly wasbrilliant. Both on her part and on Sam Claflins part. The film remindedme of The Untouchables a bit. It was a very pleasant sight to the eyeto see the bond forming between Will and Lou. Decent amount of humor aswell, found myself laughing quite often in fact. It is nice tosometimes be able to empathize with the characters as well. I can'treally think of anything negative at this point either. Maybe that mostof the movie was kind of predictable. The ending, however, might nothave been as predictable. I didn't want to go to this movie myself, butwas asked to see it. In hindsight I'm glad I tagged along, because Idid really enjoy watching it.
