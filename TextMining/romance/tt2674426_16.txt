Don't get me wrong. I like a weepy, romantic chick-flick as much as thenext guy. But this one is so manipulative and over-the-top that I feltmyself getting hostile about a third the way through. It tookself-control not to make rude comments at the screen.Part of the problem is Emilia Clarke. He character is modeled after theBrigit Jones style of self-consciously, klutzy, heart on her sleeveheroine that holds appeal to many viewers. Clarke's acting is filledwith so many facial tics it almost becomes unintentionally comic. Ifyou shaved Ms. Clarke's eyebrows, she'd convey no emotional range. Butwith them, she'd be a natural silent movie actress. Her eyebrowsliterally stole every scene they were in.The music, especially the segments used between scenes goes beyondintrusive. It is downright offensive. If a character is about to dieand is falling in love, do we really need an overwrought vocalistsinging "Oh poor me, I'm falling in love, yet I'm about to die." Thisis like a Greek chorus with one eye on the AM playlist. I'mexaggerating here, but the point is real. We don't need treacly vocalmusic to mimic what we've just seen. Most of us got it the first time.You need a break between scenes? Instrumental segues would work justfine, thank you.I've given this a "2" out of 10. In every way this big budget filmdeserves a rock bottom "1" for its manipulative and overdone approach.I've given it the extra point for the lovely location shooting. Atleast the castles don't have eyebrows.
