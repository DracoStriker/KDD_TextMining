All movies can be scrutinized for faults, as some reviewers have done,but if the movie makes a mark, then those faults really don't matter,do they? I found the "angry" Will Traynor not completely believable,not like the anti-social Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets, but SamClafin did well with his transformation. Emilia Clarke was absolutelywonderful and I will be on the lookout for other roles she has takenand will undertake in the future. Kudos also to the characters whoplayed Will's parents, Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. Two thumbs upfor the movie. Am seriously considering whether the movie ought to bumpanother movie off my favorite 50 relationship movie list.
