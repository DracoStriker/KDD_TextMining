I enjoy a good romantic comedy or 'chick flick' that tells a tale ofcomplicated people falling in love in even more complicatedcircumstances... when those people are actually decent people. That isnot the case here. Lou is in a relationship with Patrick, a seeminglynice and decent guy. He's active, fun, appropriately funny, ambitious,sweet, and he truly cares for her. They've been together 7 years! Thenshe meets Will. Will is a complete asshole. No really... there is not 1redeeming quality about him as a person. He's dull... he speaks in acompletely monotone voice the entire movie... he's not funny, not evena little bit... he's insulting... he's selfish... he's suicidal... hedoes nothing to even attempt to make anyone elses life around himbetter. The only thing that this man has going for him is that he isRICH AND HANDSOME. He even admits that he would want nothing to do withher if he was still able to walk, and this doesn't phase her one bit.We're supposed to give him a pass on all of those things just becausehe's in a wheelchair? No... sorry... just no. She falls for this guyand you could say "oh, but he was sweet and he gave her compliments"but NO. She clearly falls for him well before that. Everything shefalls for is superficial. She loves the adventure... she loves themoney... she loves the feeling that she gets from taking care of him asit makes her feel needed. There is nothing about him as a person thatshe falls for! So she throws away 7 years with a great guy for a flingwith a rich and handsome asshole. WOW! And this was the movie thatsomebody decided to make. WOW!!! This woman deserves to end up aloneand the only redeeming quality about this movie is that she is alone inthe end and I can at least imagine that this fling that she threw awayeverything for will torture her for the rest of her life as she triesto find another rich and handsome man that can fill Will's shoes, whichin reality she never will. This movie is a tragedy, not a love story.
