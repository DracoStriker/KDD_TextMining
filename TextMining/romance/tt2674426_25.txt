You know when you actually feel GRATITUDE to Hollywood and incredibletalent? This is it. After laughing and crying, this film left me feeling like I'd actuallyexperienced something for a change. Emilia Clark is an absolutedelight! Sam Claflin was perfect. I can't remember the last time I'veseen such a movie that left me feeling so emotionally drained - in agood way. Emilia is so animated and she is now one of my favourites.The script is amazingly well written -- one of those that makes youforget there even IS one, the actors deliver the story so well. Fromthe production to the directing to the editing - I can't see how theycould've done a better job. A must-see for sure.
