This film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A verybittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the sametime. I never read the book that which this film is based on. Butsometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are basedon.A beautifully well made story, it about Louisa(Emilia Clarke) a 26 yearold who finds a job taking care of Will(Sam Claflin) a youngbillionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after anaccident two years earlier, the use of his arms and legs are gone. Atfirst Will does not want Louisia there, and she does her best to put upwith him. But soon the form quite a friendship, she teaches him toenjoy life again, and he shows her to be adventurous in life. But thequestion is will this last? I like the chemistry between Claflin and Clarke, at no point it feelsforced. I really bought the affection they feel for one another. Attimes Clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish, but still good inmost of it. Claflin is believable, and the question is how would youfeel if you where in his shoes. I don't care what the critics say, thiswas a perfectly well made bittersweet film.
