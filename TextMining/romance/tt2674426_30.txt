This movie should have been called, "Mad Weak". What a terrible conceptfor a movie, a strong, privileged man turns into a huge crybaby. Hisparents characters should worn big, pink shirts with pictures ofvaginas on them throughout the movie, because they were such giantp**sies for supporting his decision to end it all. What a joke. Hisgirlfriend is a true disappointment for not tough-loving him intowaking up from his ego-induced, selfish ego maniac pathetic world-viewtrance. Terrible movie, even worse message to send younger viewers.
