Me Before You, is a romantic drama that paves a light-heartednessthroughout a confronting, profound context. Luisa (Emilia Clarke) isbreathtakingly charming as caretaker for a recently-paralyzed, Will(Sam Claflin). While the story has its predictability's, it alsosurprises within them. Notable nuances by Clarke, and Claflin shiftthis film from tolerable to pleasurable.The stand-out performance would go to Clark, with her vulnerabilitypalpable, due almost exclusively to her extensive, engaging facialexpressions, and mannerisms.While some are calling this film controversial, in regards to theunder-laying topic of euthanasia, I simply see it is as an account, aversion of a story, of a characters mindset, and their decisionregarding their own life.In a society so quick to take offence, while being so offensive ?? Iconclude that it depends on your intent as a movie-goer.If you're open to characters making their own decisions in a film, I'msure you'll find that Me Before You, puts you first.By Rocio Belinda Mendez***/5
