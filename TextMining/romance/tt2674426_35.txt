First time I have written a review but just too say a movie has nevermade me cry so much that I started to laugh and every time I keptlooking at the screen I would start balling again,I'm a 47 year oldmale who loves action movies and yet this film hit me like a grenade. Igave the film a 10 purely on how the movie made me feel. Emilia Clarkwas a joy to watch throughout the film,you were so believable to thepoint that when you cried I couldn't stop myself...if a movie can makesomeone react in this way,the film has done its job with entertainingan audience. I never read the book as I don't read books,so I saw thismovie without any knowledge on what to expect.:)
