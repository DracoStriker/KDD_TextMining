I have read the book and I will be interested to talk to my friend whohasn't. My only criticism is could you not have used one of our greatkiwi actors - seriously you had to use an Australian pretending to be akiwi badly. However the movie is lovely. I don't think I have seen atheatre in Masterton New Zealand as full as the one tonight and everyone of us was thrilled to see it. They have kept the movie pretty muchto the book which was great although I treat a movie as different fromthe book. Well done Sam Claflin I didn't see a single movement out ofcharacter. That must have been a tough thing to do so an impressiveeffort. I don't watch GOT so I had no preconceived ideas about EmiliaClarke and I thought she was great.A difficult subject and one that we have had several notable kiwi's gothrough. Well done Jojo Moyes.
