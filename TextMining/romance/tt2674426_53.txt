This is a really sweet movie, i already fell in love with Lou Clark in30 min of this movie. I haven't watched Games of Throne, not a big fan.but i really loved Emilia Clarke in this movie, she is the mostbeautiful girl with very original acting. I love the way Hollywoodmakes very original movies, not like Bollywood movie. In which Herocould have saved himself miraculously. I loved the way writer kept itreal in everything from showing emotions to showing anger. Trust me,this movie gave me chills, having someone who loves you this much isnot more than a miracle today. Really a nice piece of movie. Keep it upEmilia Clarke, we love you.
