A question that often goes around is "What is art?". And looking,throughout history, what was considered "art" it seems we are far awayfrom the consensus on this question. But most people would agree arounda general notion that art is something that makes you feel, that makesyou think, that sparks a fire inside you, that transforms you. And thismovie, in my humble opinion, does all of that, therefore deserving tobe called "a piece of art". In the age of information overload where weusually forget what we had for lunch two days ago, this movie will staywith you for a long time after you leave the cinema. And that's thebest recommendation I can give.
