At times I feel that humanity has forgotten, or never really knew, whatit is to really love someone. Jojo Moyes obviously isn't one of thosepeople. Love isn't the lust we feel at the beginning of a relationship.It's not the thoughtful vision we compile of what the future could belike or how compatible we are. It's not about how financiallysuccessful a prospective partner is. It's certainly not all about sex,although it would be hard to come to this conclusion when the mediagenerally plays strongly to that idea. It's the undeniable,overwhelming pull from our hearts that grows only when we really letourselves care about someone unselfishly. Thank you Jojo for playing this out so beautifully. Thank you Emeliaand Sam for either knowing this experience or fabulously, convincinglyportraying it on screen. This movie is a treat to watch and a glimpseof what it feels like to be a person who lives their life with a moralconscience, an open mind, a respect for beliefs that are different thanyours and a desire to see the best in the world. I feel absolutely cleansed of negativity after watching this and myhope for the world is renewed. A glorious experience!
