Me before you is the best movie of 2016, I'm not kidding!!! I've waitedso long for this movie after the trailer was out and I'm glad to saythat it was way high up my expectations!!! I've watched this movie 2times in the cinema first time with my friend, second time with myfamily and they all loved it. Not a single dry eye out from the cinemaI swear. It's so touching, funny and all in all it was awesome and thebest movie I've seen in 2016, no, best movie in terms of romance,touching-ness after The Fault In Our Stars. Seriously, this moviereached the deepest place in my heart.The cast, the sceneries and also the storyline just blew my mind. Thereare beyond words on how great the performance of Sam and Emilia was,really. If you haven't watched it, I strongly recommend you bring your loveones (and also a box of tissues) to the cinema and watch it, it won'tdisappoint I swear!!!
