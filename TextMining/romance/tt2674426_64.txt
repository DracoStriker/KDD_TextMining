I have never read the book so did not know the ending of this story(which I will not give away). I suggest however, that nobody watch thisfilm without at least reading the synopsis so they know how it ends -it may change your mind about watching it in the first place or atleast prepare you for one of the most tasteless endings in a film ever.The problem is that the movie is so sweet and monotoned that thedepressing ending both assaults you and offends. It is not givinganything away to say that the male character is contemplating Dignatas'services. With no judgement whatsoever on this it is important to notethat this is a compassionate organisation, but according to all mediafar from luxurious. The book may have dealt in detail with the realtyof disability so deadly or degrading that the sufferer feels deeplythey need release. However, this movie treats the illnesses associatedwith the male character's disability as intermittent blips in anotherwise improving quality of life. It leaves such a bitter taste inthe mouth because the conclusion is that a valuable life must beexpansive and in an able body! Being close to parents, lovingunconditionally, life unexpected are failures. It is a shame as theperformances are great - if the movie was a real romcom with a joyfulending or a serious drama with a tragic twist this story could haveworked - unfortunately, it was neither; rather it was an amusing filmthat meandered off the side of a cliff with a thud...
