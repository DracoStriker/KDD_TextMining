Schlocky, sappy romantic dramas are a dime a dozen nowadays, and mostof them follow a similar story line, just swapping out a few elements,circumstances and characters. In 'Me Before You,' we get to know thestory of a young man named Will Trainer who loses his sense of freedomdue to an accident that leaves him paralyzed (Sam Claflin), and a youngunemployed woman named Lou who gets a job as his caretaker (EmiliaClarke).As expected, 'You' is as formulaic as they come. At the outset, Willand Lou are at odds with each other, but they soon begin to tolerateand then love each other, and then a wrench gets thrown into thingsbefore everything ends melodramatically. While that is the general flowof events, there is a hope that something about the film isdifferentiated from the rest of what we've seen before. Unfortunately,that is not the case.As solid as Claflin and Clarke have been in other work, they comeacross as hollow, wooden and appear to be less skilled actors than weall know they are. There are some supporting performances from JanetMcTeer and Charles Dance that are okay, but they are nothing to reallywrite home about. So, when the plot is below average and the acting isforgettable, it's hard for a film to be enjoyable unless there is areamazing visual effects, soundtrack, etc. While the best element of'You' is its soundtrack, this is not enough to carry the film.If you like film adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels (and this is notone of those, but it sure feels like one), then you will probably enjoy'Me Before You.' If not, resist the temptation to give it a chance.
