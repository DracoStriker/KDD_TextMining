Yep. I hated it. I didn't find the girl super likable or welldeveloped, the fashion was so far out there it was awful. It felt likethere was very little character development there, we are meant to takeher as a "chatty Cathy" but it doesn't seem that way. She's not thatquick of a talker or that much of one. Likewise there is little reasonto believe she hated the guy- he wasn't super developed either. Seemedlike they hated / endured each other and then it switched all of thesudden. The male character had a chance to grow but didn't. It couldhave foreshadowed the ending better, (Scenes where she walks in and heIS in pain and hides it after he notices her, or times when he's alittle crabby to other people and she brushes it off) I didn't find hisdecision that inline with the man that was portrayed, making him ahypocrite when he tells Clark to go on and live her life to thefullest.There are several themes made by the ending that I fully disagree with.1. If you're in enough pain, it's OK to kill yourself. 2. Its better todie than to be a burden. 3. You can choose to die, it's not selfish,and after a month, the girl you had WATCH your death will be totally OKand without grief. 4. If all else fails, give said girl a trust fundand you can buy her happiness, and she won't grieve anymore. 5. Deathis romantic.Yes, you can say it's up to the viewer to decide to take out of it, butthese themes were implied by Clark's lack of remorse or sadness at theend. There are reviewers that say it highlights the joy of living andit is only the male that goes against them, but the happy way the endwas portrayed discredits the highlights given.The few things I did like: The castle and rich people house and qualityof film was OK.
