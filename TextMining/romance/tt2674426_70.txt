The weepy "Me Before You" stars Sam Clafin, an actor so photogenic hadmovies not been invented before his birth, they surely would havedeveloped once he hit puberty just so he had some way of sharing howhandsome he is. Thewestchestarian wonders how he didn't get the "50Shades of Grey" lead ahead of dead-on-the-inside Jamie Dornan. Sam alsobrings a delightful "English-ness" to the role overshadowing theCampbell Scott original "Dying Young". Despite her London upbringingEmilia Clarke (please consider that final "e" when pronouncing hersurname Americans) doesn't bring that same underlying seriousness andgravitas that English actors contribute. The two work well togetheralthough you can see Clafin dictating the relationship and Clarkereacting to him more than acting. The story they act in is a bit whatyou would expect. Will's life basically went from the top of humanexperience to some area below average although he remains very wealthyand can afford every accommodation a quadriplegic could ask for. Hedeals with justifiable anger and suicidal thoughts which "Lou" holdseases but ultimately doesn't relieve. Any interesting aspect of thestory is the personal growth Lou undergoes through her association withWill and, perhaps to a greater degree, his upper crust wealthy family.The movie doesn't shy away from the obvious class differences inEnglish society. In short, you largely know where the story is headedand much of the direction is aimed at jerking forth tears but it isworth the ride.
