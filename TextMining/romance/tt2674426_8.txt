Emelia Clarke's work on Game of Thrones is the only reason I watchedthis movie in the first place. She is occasionally transcendent in thatrole, where she must keep her eyebrows restrained, and I wanted to seewhat would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free ... freeas her dragons.There are a lot of solid things about this movie. The story (of a youngwoman who cares for a quadriplegic young man) is strong, the directionand cinematography good though not exceptional, the screen writing alsogood-not-exceptional, the supporting cast (especially Janet McTeer andCharles Dance)and leading man (Sam C.) quite good, and the emotionalnotes it hits, though all predictable and often a bit overwrought (cueswelling, heartwarming music...), ring true enough for an unabashedromance.So, not really my type of movie. But I am happy to say that I was(almost) completely taken by Clarke's performance. Her character hereis nothing like her GoT role, but is in many ways an equallyfantasy-based role (but with clumsy shyness and striped leggingsinstead of fireproof skin and dragons) -- and Clarke manages to pullthis character out of romantic fantasy into believability aseffectively as she brings to life her role as Mother of Dragons. Shehas the combination of charisma, physical beauty, character-actingchops, and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice, 7-of-10 heartwarmerup to a 9-of-10 charmer.
