Sorry, there are a lot of bad choices made about this movie which makesme regret the decision to watch it.The story is pretty straightforward - a guessable romantic stereotypecreated by undeveloped characters.The action is moving in an unpredictable manner, jumping from one stageof development to five stages later in a matter of seconds.On top of that, the awful pop music between the scenes affectsunpleasantly my mood and makes the experience even worse.I'm voting with 4 stars only because of the acting, which is the onlygood thing about this movie. I will leave the work of the directorwithout a comment.
