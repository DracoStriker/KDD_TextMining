23 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Me BeforeYou. When quirky Lou Clark loses her job in a tea shop she is leftdesperate to get a new one to help support her family. Along comes theTraynor family. Will Traynor, a quadriplegic needs a carer although hedoesn't think he wants one, at this point Lou comes into his world andturns it upside down. Will is set on ending his life, Lou discoversthis and embarks on a scheme to make him change his mind. Adapted froma book (which I haven't read yet) we are introduced to two verydifferent kinds of people, Will who yearns for the old life he lost andsees every day as an empty glass, and Lou who's bubbly personality andinfectious smile lead her glass to not only be full, but positivelyoverflowing. This is a story of hardship, and of hope and alsointroduces us to the ethical and very personal struggles of people notonly considering assisted suicide but also the family and friends whohave no say in the matter but want very much to get involved. It was avery emotional journey, there were many light hearted moments and avery fitting soundtrack. One more point, I noticed I the credits thatthe producers assistant was Peregrine Kitchener-Fellowes, son ofDownton Abbey Writer, Julian Fellows.
