I have already read the book, so I decided to most definitely see themovie. I think that they did very well on a book to movie adaptation,because they didn't change too much from the book. The movie wasbeautifully made, and fit just what I and others who have read it in mycity had pictured for the movie.The casting was brilliant, as with the portrayal of Louisa and Will.Both characters were charismatic, and enjoyable, and matched thedialogue of the book, which I thought was great.The movie itself was heartbreaking, hilarious at points, and just andlovable. The story itself is well thought out and great. One of thebest things about this, is it is not just your usual love story. Thereal love doesn't take over the whole plot. It isn't fully made to feelintimate, but just to feel real.So I say: Go see it. If you are a boy or girl, it doesn't matter. Thismovie is memorable for everyone.
