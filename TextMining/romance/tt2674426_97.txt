At the heart of this movie is an emotional political issue, but firstlet me say something about how well done the movie is.Of course Emilia Clarke does a wonderful job and is quite lovable inLou's quirky way. Sam Claflin has a difficult part and does it wellalso. Janet McTeer and Charles Dance, as Will's parents, also playdifficult roles and help us get drawn into the emotion of the story. Iam a Jenna Coleman fan and had to wonder what she would have been likeas Lou.It becomes clear about half way in that this is not going to be ahappily ever after story no matter what happens in the end.As to the politics, I am against any kind of suicide for moral reasons.I don't believe that the choice of when a person dies lies with mortalman. More importantly, I am concerned that in a society where assistedsuicide becomes at all common, it also becomes very easy for variousforces to take away the choices of those who want to live. Insurancecompanies already are very close to taking away that choice in somecases. Will and his family did not seem to have the financial pressure.For people with a family that already lives on the edge financially, amedical condition like Will's could threaten to destroy it foreveryone.On the other hand, I can sympathize with the way Will felt. While Idon't condone the result, I can see how the hopelessness, especiallythe day to day hopelessness, can lead a person to think that Will'schoice is the better one.I thought this story dealt with the issue respectfully and gives plentyof reason for thought and discussion.
