The movie from the first scene up to the end was emotionless andspiritless. I do appreciate that they didn't want to change the storymuch and keep the classic version for the most. Even when the movie wasslightly tweaked, it was in the wrong dull way. Some tweaks don'treally make sense and don't add up.I don't know whom should be blamed for the 'emotion delivery failure'is it the cast or the director? Emma Watson is good actress for somecertain roles, but certainly not this one. She was very stiff. Wecouldn't differentiate her surprise from anger or love from sadness. Inmany scenes Belle and the Beast were talking so fast with no emotions,soul or spirit. It was as if they were rehearsing on a play by readingout loud from their scripts and the director was simply not there.Cinematography had a problem too. Too many close ups. The originalcartoon had some close ups too, but Do they really have to copyeverything as-is? The couple dancing scene cinematography could havebeen better.I really don't advise anyone to see this movie. Disney failed thistime. It happens, though!. Hopefully we'll know what really happened.
