I had the opportunity to watch this movie today and man it wasdisappointing. It was boring. reason being perhaps that it felt likethe copy of the original. These were the great cartoons which we grewup watching. But why would the same songs, characters, story beentertaining for us, we could just watch the cartoons again, why botherto remake. It might have been entertaining if characters were a littlebelievable at least. The beast lack any emotion. Emma Watson (though Ilove her) was just trying to copy belle from the cartoons. She wasn'teven given a chance to try to portray the character of belle and notthe 'acting' of cartoon belle (she wasn't even successful in that). Theonly person I liked in the movie was Gaston. The rest of the characterswere soooo animated that it stole the real feel of the movie whichshould really be the purpose of remaking a movie after all. A few newsongs were added which were quite boring. The village of belle wasaweeeefuulllll. Why Why Why would they make a village which just looklike a ground full of hideous people. Why not put a little more moneyin that part. The reason of the movie should be to give a real lifefeeling to fairy tales ( which jungle book and Cinderella gave), not tojust make it more cartoonish.stay away from this one and save your money
