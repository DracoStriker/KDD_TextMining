Like all Disney fans from the 80's to present, I found myself excitedto see this live action adaptation once I saw the teaser poster! Idecided to ignore the naysaying that followed with the trailers, andthe wave of immoral rhetoric being associated with the sexuality ofLeFou. (Rolls eyes) Ignoring all of this I decided to make a judgement call after seeingthe movie. I've came to the conclusion that this movie is to Disneymovies what the original Blair witch was to the horror genre. Thismovie apparently cost $160,000,000 which begs to question: Where didthey spend all this money? The sets designs and props were hastily puttogether. The village at the opening looks like the village Dorothylands in, at the beginning of the wizard of oz. Next is the CGI! Thebudget and expertise behind Disney should not have been lacking. Thismovie could've been a cash cow. But the sad fact is, Disney let finedetails and lackadaisical work ethic be passed off as a masterpiece. Emma Watson is a tremendous actress, and this is evident in her abilityto phone in a wonderful performance to a imaginary beast. Disneyplease, please... please heed this. When the Gorilla from 'Mighty JoeYoung' a movie from 1998 looks more realistic than your beast in 2017you must realize you've made a mistake. Disney used to be the go to foramazing movies that left you with spirit and wonder. What they'veproved with their latest live action movies Is the realization, thatthey just crank out regurgitated movies with less effort just to cashin on nostalgia. From now on we will be renting Disney movies fromredbox instead of seeing them in theaters.
