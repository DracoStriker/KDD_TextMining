I think the problem with Disney live-action remakes, is that there'ssuch awkwardness in the layout, I personally felt that in the case ofBeauty and the Beast, the live-action version can't "perform" the storyvery well, it appears to me that they are trying to tell the story witha fusion that combines animation, movie and musical, a bit ofeverything in everywhere, however I don't really enjoy this experience.The actors and actresses were fine considering the demands andpreference of the audiences (consumers), some of them did very well,Like Gaston and LeFou. I think that Emma Watson looks very pretty onscreen as Belle, and her singing is okay, but I personally felt thather acting is very stiff, her singing skills is very much not enoughfor a musical. She is a very successful and smart celebrity, I thinkshe is a very good fashion and makeup model too, but her performances(including Harry Potter, etc) on screen I've seen so far, haven'tappear to me as a professional/convincing actress at all, I never seenher looking like she is doing (performing, acting) something shebelieves. As Belle Emma Watson sometimes looks miserable, like she isforcing her face to hold on expression(disgusted, love, sad, etc.) thatshe was told to. I felt that my money spent on the movie ticket wasburned watching her performance, and this isn't the first time at allwhen it comes to movies that has her in the cast, I remember feelingreally angry last time when I saw her performance in Harry Potter- TheGoblet of Fire, because I can't believe I spent money to get to watchsuch unprofessional performance of a pretty "actress" like her on amainstream movie, and now in B&TB she hasn't improve at all. Overall I think everything on the screen appears to be pretty but alsoboring (awkward). I personally much prefer the 1991 version, for me itis one of the best from Disney. I kind of wish they didn't do theremake.
