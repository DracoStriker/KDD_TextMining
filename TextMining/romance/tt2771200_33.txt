Skip this movie. You won't miss anything. Except perhaps the goodperformance by Luke Evans as Gaston. But still, the bad aspects of thisfilm just overrides any good ones.There were too many distractions in the film that it does not evolveinto a movie experience. There are lots of propaganda in this film. Ifyou would like to put racial minority actors, you don't pick 18thcentury France as your setting. I am a racial minority so I can saythis. They also depict that gays as mostly men in drag, weak and the socalled gay scenes are not empowering at all but rather tacky. I am gay,so I have a right to say this.The worst distraction and aspect of this film is Emma Watson. Shedoesn't give justice to the role of Belle. You can see it in her eyes.This actress grew up with everything, having played Hermione. Belle isa sweet, innocent provincial lass. Every time I look at Emma Watson, itseems like I am waiting for her to roll her eyeballs or take out acellphone and tweet.Dan Stevens looked effeminate and his beast form should have been abird and not a mammal. Josh Gad looked mechanical, uninspired andunconvincing as gay LeFou. I watched this film because I was afraid I would miss out on somethinghistoric or a good film sequence. But sadly there was none. I shouldhave skipped this.
