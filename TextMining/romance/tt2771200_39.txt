This had all the hallmarks of a great live action fantasy epic.Brilliant visuals and great effects, a half decent story with someinteresting characters, and of course, it's Disney. What could possiblygo wrong?2 words, Emma Watson.I know Ms Watson has legions of fans who'll watch anything she is injust because of her Harry Potter connections but almost everything Isee her in, she ruins. She has the acting range of a wooden block, herdelivery is so stilted here, that it completely takes you out of thefilm and her facial expressions never seem to change. Seriously, shecould have been wearing a mask in this and you wouldn't have been ableto tell any difference, she just stares blankly and looks disinterestedfor the whole film. She's awful as Belle and her dialogue delivery iscringe inducing. I lost count of the amount of times I rolled my eyeswhen she tried to convey any emotion, it was embarrassing.Now, I'm not trying to simply beat up Emma Watson because I dislikeher, it isn't that at all, but when someone in a film is so bad theymake the film almost impossible to enjoy, it really needs to be pointedout.This could have been a great fantasy epic but I myself couldn't waitfor it to end. Shame really, had they have cast an actress with amorsal of talent or acting skill, this could have been really good.Stick to the original animated film, it's far better.No doubt it will still make tons of cash though.
