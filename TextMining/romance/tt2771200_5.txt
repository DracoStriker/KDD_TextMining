This adaptation is a disgrace to the original. Watson's voice is auto-tuned to death and the Beast CGI wasn't good. Each time the Beastpopped up, he was very off putting. Watson's line deliveries are poorand doesn't do the animated princess justice. She also seems a bit tooyoung for the role. She is a total miscast. Despite the Beast's CGI, atleast his performance was very good as both the Beast and Princecompared to Watson. Emma Thompson's rendition of Tale as Old as Timedoes not beat the animated tea cup, but at least she was not auto tunedto death. There are very few moments of originality as it is a frame byframe copy to the animated film. It's very uninspiring and unnecessary.0/10.
