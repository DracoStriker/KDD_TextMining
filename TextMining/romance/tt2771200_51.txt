I'm not a fan of remakes and to me, a Disney "classic" is extremelyhard to recreate. Maleficent doesn't count as a "remake" ... which wasstill entertaining! However, I was dissuaded to watch this version intheaters because of all the bad reviews. So the only caveat I leavehere is that I had lower expectations than normal when I watched.Beauty and the Beast has been retold several times (since 1740!) andthe Disney cartoon is not the one and only version to compare thismovie to. I heard the songs prior to the movie and I wasn't in love.BUT -- once in context ... it all made sense. The acting seemed "flat"only because the people were showing true human (non- cartoon) emotion.Singing of a poor, provincial town would not be a HAPPY song for Belle... but Emma Watson executed the mood perfectly. The chatter about theopenly gay character was a terrible shadow on the movie and was #1) notthe focus and #2) NATURAL in again, human life. ***SPOILERS AHEAD***The adaptations, side stories and little facts were placed for verygood reason. The audience sees a deeper story behind The Beast. Infact, the very reason why Maurice is imprisoned was taken from theoriginal story written in 1740. The story comes full circle when theBeast takes Belle to Paris and sees where she came from and WHY takinga rose was so important. I really liked the relationships shown and howthis movie stayed as true to the cartoon "classic" as possible with anadded flair appropriate for 2017 and humanized the characters evenmore.Give the movie a chance -- and remember, it's a FAIRY TALE. Not aplatform that should reflect any position on anything social, economicor political. The added songs are not bad and I actually really likethe Beast's solo. Remember, it's a movie meant to entertain audiences... not prove abilities to critics.
