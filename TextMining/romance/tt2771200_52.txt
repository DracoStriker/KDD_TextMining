I am going to say it. For all Disney's recent "updates" they have notquite figured how to actually write a feminist love story. The olderones were better, and the strength of their females was allowed tospeed for itself. The old 1991 film is much better in this area. In this one, it is stated that Belle will need to marry a man who canprovide for her when her father dies, something that is not in theoriginal film. This actually happened to female intellectuals of thatera. They could be smart, but could never use their intelligence tohelp provide for their family. Nannerl Mozart was supposedly astalented as her brother Wolfgang, but had to quit performing once shemarried. So, Belle still has to marry a rich man to help her. There was that Maleficent film several years ago,where the three strongfemale characters, the fairies, where transformed into bumbling idiots.And in the original film, aurora's parents showed true love by sendingher away for 16 years, and not see her for her own safety. Which wasprobably extra difficult for them since she lived just outside thevillage.in the "feminist" one, her mom dies and dad is a villain. Somehow, the newer "feminist" updated films have seemed to make theirfemale characters weaker. They can include songs in their films pokingfun at true loves kiss and love at first sight and keep the princesssingle all they want to, but it means nothing's if they can't actuallyfigure out how to make the princess wife, mom, provider, Queen, etc. And don't get me started on how mean he is to bell up until she isattacked by the wolves. And none of the castle servants family can helpthem break the curse? Please! And be our guest was not nearly flashyenough. Gastons character seemed inconsistent, and monsieur d arquewasn't creepy enough.The old songs felt crammed in there too. I have seen the Broadway show3 times.
