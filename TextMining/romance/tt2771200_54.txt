Beauty and the Beast is by far one of my most favourite movies. Thestory it portrays, the music and magic and morals knowing that loveheals all, unfortunately, I only saw and felt all that from theanimated version and not this one. This movie lacked the good old "warmand fuzzy" feeling you get from Disney's animated movies, it lacked"heart." It just seemed a little emotionless and forced, some bits evenseem rushed, other parts had nothing to do with the original at all. Iwas looking forward to see how Beast would be as a "realistic" versionbut they didn't capture Beast's imagery or personality at all and Ifeel the same way about Emma Watson playing "Belle" I like Emma Watson,she is a great actress but she is no "Belle." I wanted to like thismovie and I was hoping for the same satisfaction as I got from theanimation, but I couldn't. I have been a Disney fan all my life but Ithink Disney should have left this one alone, sorry but the animationwas better.
