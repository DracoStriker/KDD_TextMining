THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS It is really simple. If they wanted to make a good movie, a really good movie they wouldtake care of two things. 1. Belle. They would cast an actor who canactually ...act.(After watching the movie it is pretty obvious that the only reasonWatson landed the role is her pretty big fan base of teenagers from herHarry Potter films)What we needed for Belle's role? Fresh, energetic, with a smile that lights her face actress. What we got? The twin sister of Bella Swan that landed herself in medieval France.Seriously I was waiting for Edward Cullen to do a cameo from time totime. Haven't watched miss Watson in Harry Potter films but this was just adisaster. 2. The Beast. It was so.... distressing to watch a soulless face throughout the movietalking. Even at the peak of the Beast's story when he lets Belle go,and we suppose to see the agony, the pain, all I get is.... nothing.Soulless. Flat. Disappointing.I am confused. Should the actor still work harder and deliver his roleas a beast better or it is due that horrible CGI head that we can'tappreciate his performance? Either way, again, they could do a lot better. To sum this up, soulless Beast x miscast Belle leads to this awfulremake to a classic animated film that we all grew up to love. Save your money and go watch something else.
