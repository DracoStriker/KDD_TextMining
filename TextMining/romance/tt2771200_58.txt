The Plot. If you don't know the plot, you have been living under a rockfor 40 years. So the direction is good. The look of the movie is good. The expositionis good. The special effects are good. The acting is decent. But thereis something missing. You'll leave the movie feeling empty. There is noheart to this movie.It's mechanical.And then there is the pandering like I've never seen. Over the topflaming gay characters abound and every person of color is partneredwith a white person. What? They couldn't find one set of blacks to bepartnered?It's really offensive to our sensibilities because movies now have beenreduced to identity politics and quotas instead of making good movies.Disney must be spinning in his grave.
