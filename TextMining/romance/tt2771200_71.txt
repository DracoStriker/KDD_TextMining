This review will be spoiler free, so you don't have to be afraid ofspoilers and can read on if you like^^Story line: Of course, this movie follows the story line of the Disneymovie version, but what I really like is that they changed some thingswhich didn't make sense in the original animated movie. They also givemore information on the background of the characters and theirfamilies. Due to that I felt more into the movie and the story. Theyalso added some hilarious joke lines between the romantic and seriousmoments of the movie.Camera: The camera work was alright. Most of the time satisfying, butat some points, I would have wished a different perspective.Transition: The transition therefore were great, awesome! Betweensummer and winter, day and night, it was just beautiful.Setting: Of course the setting was also great. The village looked tinyand cute, the castle astonishing, scary, but beautiful at the sametime. Characters: A lot of people even complained about the actor for theprince before. But I thought, he was alright. I really liked hissinging voice though. The other cast members were really good. EmmaWatson was a perfect Belle and Luke Evans as Gaston was amazing! Eventhe side characters were well portrait.Music: The music was of course wonderful. But for some people, whodon't like singing in a movie...You shouldn't watch this one then.There were a lot of songs and even more than in the animated version.But they were all very well composed and beautifully sung.Conclusion: I really liked the movie in a lot of aspects. What I haveto complain about a little bit is the camera work and the cast for theprince. (Sorry...) All in all it's a really great movie which I wouldlike to watch again any time.
