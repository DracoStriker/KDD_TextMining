By this way, I was easy to understand what character is ortheir situation very much. These songs are fun and attract us. Next, Iwas moved by Bell. I think that she is pure and an upright woman. Ithink that she show us importance of honesty. Next, I think that thisfilm expresses the strong of woman because Bell faces adversity withcourage.
