A beautiful film crucially inspired with artistic perspective andmultifarious virtuosity of solid directorial pulse by Bill Condon inhis cinematic canvass, also including sequences of tribute to the greattradition of classic musicals, with the potentiality of establishingthe film as a future classic itself. Emma Watson is wonderful, DanStevens is superb, Ewan McGregor is amazing, Emma Thompson isexcellent, the great gentleman of acting Sir Ian McKellen iseuphorically enjoyable as always delivering his touch of gem, whileexquisite performances are also offered at any rate by a brilliant castin every role of actors such as Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Kevin Kline,Audra McDonald, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Stanley Tucci, Haydn Gwynne, HattieMorahan, Ray Fearon, etc. Delight of a fine cinematic tale.
