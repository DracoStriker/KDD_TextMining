I am not a fan of musicals but I went to watch this one out ofnostalgia. I like the fact that they kept the original songs. Unlike aLOT of people in here, I did not mind the autotune because I didn'twant to hear the voices of the actors if they were bad. Now people willcomplain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, endof story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am reallyglad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is aremake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin theoriginal. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one isdefinitely coming, you'll get your different story. The visuals were OKbut could have been better especially Belle's village.
