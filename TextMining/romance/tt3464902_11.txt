I think we're supposed to get a point about the importance of humanfeelings. So we get a stupidly enforced scenario, where you see nocorrelation between act and react. If somebody is to be evil and kicksomebody to death or disfigure somebody, I'd like some grasp as to why.Hell, maybe it's based on some personal loss. Or it's some peculiarfable over the current European refugee crisis or something. Admirable,in such case. Don't get me wrong. I'm fine with fables, it has its ownbeautiful tradition and storytelling raison d'être. But you need to atleast believe in the scenario for the duration. If you fail at that,your point is lost to people. There's no discernible reason as to whyit's so life-or-death important, that people of this civilization hasto be paired, otherwise they get killed because they're "loners." Orwhy pairs has to share interests, otherwise they have to split up andthen they get killed. It's a completely bizarre construct, you can onlyimagine came up during a talentless script session. "This is how wemake something, that'll stand out. 'Cause we're artists, we are, weare!"Sometimes a crappy film is worth the time just for the laugh. Not here,you just feel sad for people acting in it. No actor should be subjectedto such a naked emperor. If it didn't have another chap's name on it,you'd think it was a Lars Trier pile of poo. This is the kind of stuffMonty Python justly mocked. Not even unsolicited graphic sex scenes cansave this junk. I smell razzies so much it hurts. I smell an A listactor quickly going B or worse.
