What a God Awful film this is. The only thing worth looking is theperformance of Colin Farrell. Thats it.The rest of the film is so boring, the title of the movie couldactually be "The Boring Movie". Nothing really happens in the entirefilm so it may easily carry this title.Artsy fartsy is the common description here, including direction,acting, casting....you name it, it's horrible, cheap and uninspiring inany way possible. They probably thought the audience would find this idea surrounded bywaves of boredom interesting. In some sort of weird way. Unfortunatelythis is not film making, it's called sleeping in our chairs while thisfilm plays on.If this didn't have Colin Farrell in it, you would probably never havewatched it anyways. Farrell gives a solid performance I really likedit, but he looked totally out of place, given the terrible soundtrackand co-casting. I recommend this film to be made again from scratchwith Farrell and a much better crew, it could be made much much better.NEXT !!!
