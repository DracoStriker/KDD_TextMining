As credits were running and Lobster viewers were exiting the theater,an attendant was standing by the door. He asked the exiting audiencehow the movie was. This proved to be the most beneficial moment in thelast 2 hours; as a collective we were able to vent our disgust.Indeed,the film served to bind us as an audience with the commondenominator being our shared theatrical abuse.This is more than a poor movie, it is an in-your-face, full frontalassault to any sense of moral and intellectual value. No compasswhatever. In a poor movie I can find redeeming value --- a comfortableseat, some popcorn and maybe a little sleep. This was too terrible tonap although I've never wanted to close my eyes so hard.Gratuitous violence with un-deeming value includes (CAUTION HERE):Donkey getting shot. Dog kicked to death with image of dog's intestineson floor. Person bound and dropped into open grave with dogs to devourface (dogs have collars on?). Hand forced into toaster. Lips gettingsliced with razor blade. Forced (and optional?) blindness.A unique movie but only by way of its horrorableness.In the imagined words of Nurse Ratched this is "The perfect movie forthe cinemaly insane."
