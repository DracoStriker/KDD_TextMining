The high praise for this movie on Rotten Tomatoes and also on IMDb mademe make an account here. I have never disagreed more and quite franklydo not understand at all why the critics do not see how pretentious andawful this movie is. The actors are OK, but the film is a disaster. Itstarts out looking very art-house, with very slow story line andeverybody looking artsy, but as it goes along the story becomes soutterly ridiculous and sickening without any purpose other than to beridiculous and sickening that the movie really just turns into an emptyshell, a pretentious 'how weird and shocking can we be' sort of thing.It wants to be art-house so bad it screams it at you. Overkill. Theentire movie I wondered who had managed to convince the actors this wasa good job to take on. Maybe I am looking at this from a Europeanperspective? Maybe American cinema is lost in between Hollywood and aplace they don't know where it is anymore. Art for art's sake can begood, but you can really fail if you overdo it. Maybe we can invent anew term for it: desperate cinema. Desperate to be special.
