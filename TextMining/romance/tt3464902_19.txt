We went into this movie with high hopes for some sort of absurdistblack comedy, as it's being billed - and as many reviewers havedescribed it. Instead, we were treated to an overlong, pretentious artproject that felt more like an undergraduate student film created by anemotionally stunted sophomore. All the actor's lines are delivereddeadpan, with no emotion, regardless of the situation. There is are afew (very minor) chuckles to be sure, but they hardly compensate forthe overall deadly serious tone. It's dreary, poorly edited, andcontains some revolting scenes involving violent death and extremeanimal cruelty. Truly terrible and a waste of a great cast.Spoiler: The ending is.
