The Lobster is a curious film with shades of the Coen Brothers or GrandHotel Budapest (the fact that so much is set in a hotel is incidental,or hotels in movies are places to be avoided). Dysfunctional charactersdrift through, delivering their lines with humorous lack of awarenessand emotion, strange rituals are performed to bond the guests, and allthe time the clock is ticking - find a partner, become a couple, within45 days or be turned into an animal of your choice.The first part of the film is amusing, quirky and entertaining. Thestyle is pleasant and interesting, despite some nasty moments. Some ofthe shots drag a little, but it adds to the curious atmosphere. Thedry, deadpan dialogue is perfectly delivered, Colin Farrell as the mainprotagonist shows he really is a fine actor.Then the film changes. New characters are introduced and the moodbecomes much bleaker. No longer is this humorous, the stakes havechanged. It is hard to identify with the new characters as we hadalready invested emotion in the earlier ones. And it gets worse,leading to en ending that is as unclear as it is unpleasant.The Lobster cannot seem to make up its mind what kind of a film it is,is it simply saying that we are all venal and craven in the end? If so,why the humour at the beginning? And if we are capable of love, is itreally so shallow as to be broken by people saying things?I loved the beginning, I didn't like the end. This was one fish dishthat left a bad taste.
