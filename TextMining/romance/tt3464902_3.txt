"The Lobster" takes the tropes and expectations of modern-dayrelationships and satirises them almost out of existence. The farcical"Hotel" aims to partner 'loner' humans with each other (based on 1characteristic) in a stress-inducing timeframe of 45 days, oftenresulting in deception and the suppression of true feelings in order togarner a relationship as a means of escape. The other side of the coinis the outcast tribe living a meagre existence in the woods, where evenflirting is punished with physical mutilation. The cold mechanicaldelivery of every single character's lines emphasises the absurdity ofthe situation, and bizarrely makes the jokes even funnier. Not sinceRichard Ayoade's "The Double" has cripplingly awkward humour been soeffective. This film has a lot to say about the fickle nature ofrelationships, set against the background of a dystopian society. Thecinematography is as flat as the actors' delivery; this contributes tothe emotionally-stunted, often silent world that the charactersinhabit. The ending is beautifully ambiguous and surprisingly tense forsuch an understated scene. A score which fluctuates from terse, roughstring melodies to Italian opera heightens the sense of weird-art-filmwhich pervades "The Lobster": definitely a film which requires fullattention, reflection, and a mind open to arty weirdness, "The Lobster"is a remarkable oddity.
