If a movie viewer has occasional thoughts of suicide or selfmutilation, do not, I repeat, do not see this movie - you willcertainly be driven to act on your impulses. And if, kind reader, youare free of such maladies, do not, I repeat, do not see this movie. Ifviewed in its entirety, you will certainly join the ranks of thosementioned at the beginning of this comment. The only redeemingqualities of this film stem from the filming location - the gorgeousParknasilla Resort in Sneem - which derives its name from the OldEnglish word "sneem" - "the knot". And that is how my brain felt at theend of this travesty - as if it was tied in a painful, hideous knot.
