I honestly don't even know where to start with this review. I supposeI'll start with the plot, which has something to do with single peoplebeing sent away to a hotel where they're given a certain amount of timeto fall in love, or they are turned into an animal of their choice. Thepremise seemed somewhat interesting to me, but having just finished thefilm, I can honestly say that was the biggest waste of 110 minutes inmy life. The dialog in this film and the way the characters behave areabsolutely ridiculous, not to mention a score that I can't even beginto describe how strange and annoying it was. The camera lingers for anuncomfortable amount of time frequently, and the beginning scene tohook the viewer is never visited again. The few redeeming qualities themovie had were completely overshadowed by the ridiculousness, and themore I think of the events in the movie, the more angry I feel ofhaving wasted my time. When rating a film, I try to be as fair as I possibly can, and if thereare some redeeming qualities I will recognize and account for them inmy review. Unfortunately for The Lobster, I cannot be honest withmyself and give this more than 1 star; that's how appalling I found thefilm. I almost gave this an additional star for the couple moments thatmade me chuckle, or the satisfaction of certain characters dying, butthe last shot made me just stare blindly at the screen with disbelief.Not a shocked disbelief, but the disbelief that I did not turn the filmoff and do something constructive with my time (as I almost did morethan once). It is for this reason that I cannot give the film more than1 star. Some will see The Lobster and consider it an extraordinarily accuratesatire of our society, and point out the metaphors in the film. Whilethat may be true, great metaphors don't always make great movies. Suchis the case for The Lobster, and I feel that if you do spend timewatching this, you will either love it for what it is, or hate yourselffor watching it.
