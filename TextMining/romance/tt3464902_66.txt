Okay, I'll say it. I agree with the reviewers here who thought thismovie was rubbish and I think those who say it was great are in the'emperor's new clothes' arena (If you fail to 'get it' then you areintellectually inferior). In science fiction you can go anywhere and doanything (that's the beauty of the genre) as long as you stay withinthe confines of the premise, the 'logic' of the premise driving thestory, and the 'rules' set down. This movie stayed in the premise butthe audience was never told why the premise existed in the first place,why certain "rules" were instigated and why most of the things thathappened happened. Much of what turned up on the screen seems to havecome from the writer's random thoughts with no real chance for theaudience to get involved in the story and therefore to feel any empathyfor the characters. Makes for very poor story telling. I was bored anddisappointed. And I've seen Colin Farrell do much better than this (Ihope he takes the weight off ? the few extra pounds have made him lookvery ordinary). 2 out of 10 for me.
