One of the top ten 2015 IMDb movies and its just plain awful. I neverwrite reviews but I was shocked the caliber of actors involved in thismovie and what bad roles they accepted. This reminded me of a societyof mental handicapped people with no emotions or expressions trying tofunction and its just not amusing at all and 2 dimensional. How wasthis a comedy in anyway did I miss the jokes? I'm shocked the actorsread this script and thought it was a good idea even for a futuristicindie art house movie. I wish the actors had to payback people's moneyand 2 hours of their life they would rethink garbage like this. Movieslike this are when actors are starting to jump the shark and goingnowhere fast. Movies like ex machina are movies worth praise not thisdull dribble of a movie. In response as to how this was some kind ofstatement of society and relationships in what way? All people look forcompanionship and to trivialize people struggles to connect with oneanother and find love to a simplistic moronic view really insults theviewer and life in general. Even a day after watching this movie I'mjust shaking my head thinking how bad it was and how it was even made.
