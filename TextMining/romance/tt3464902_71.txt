Lobster fails as a film because it is burdened with far too manyincredible features to make the viewer accept the reality of thebizarro world it exists in. It begins with the totally unexplainedpremise that an alternative universe exists in which single people arerequired to find a mate within 45 days or face being turned into ananimal and goes down from there. For example, the primary means ofattracting a mate in this alternate universe is to have some sort ofdefect shared by a potential lover such as nose bleeding or theinability to feel compassion. Nor is it clear why virtually everycharacter speaks in the same stilted pseudo-Stalinist manner, or whythe hotel in which they must search for a mate seems to be liftedstraight from 1930s Soviet Union . In short, all credibility seems tobeen jettisoned in an efforts to create some kind of black humor. Butthe artists seem to have forgotten the humor is only funny if it isfound in a credible context. There is nothing credible about any ofthese robotic characters nor the weird illogical world in which theylive. Therefore when the film reached its final idiotic and yetrepulsive conclusion I felt nothing but relief that the torture wasfinally over.
