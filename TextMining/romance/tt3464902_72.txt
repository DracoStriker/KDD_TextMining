This movie was not good. I was very eager to like it, but could not. Itwas flimsy, weak, and felt as though it was made by a 12 year old kidwho inherited enough money to make a big budget film. I got the "socialcommentary" - so don't try to "educate" me. It was just a poor effort.They (film-makers) just figured that a little bit of awkward sex &violence would make an amazing statement. Fail. Good cast/good originalidea/horrible execution. For me, the most satisfying moment of themovie came at the end, when I entered the men's room, dropped mytrousers, sat down on the bowl, and cranked out a steaming turd thatwas almost as rotten as this film. Done.
