Senseless, not funny and worse than mean and sadistic. It wasfrightening listening to the audience laughing at scenes from arealistically depicted suicide's bloody body after it fell to anequally realistic dead and beaten up bloody dog. As a critique of current romance one wonders what kind of personalhells the people who wrote this monstrous movie have gone through. Theywould have been far better going through psychotherapy than writingthis adolescent crap.Even more frightening than the bloodied dead dog and suicide's bloodybody were the high ratings this movie received. What are critics andpeople thinking? The movie and the audiences reaction to it were so upsetting we walkedout.Good lord, where have we come?
