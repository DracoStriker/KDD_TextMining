This movie is so freaking bad that I am compelled to write the firstreview of my life. The only thing that made me watch this movie was therating (don't know if the raters were hallucinating). I thought maybethere will be a point in the movie that will justify the ratings. Butnope. The movie is full of garbage, stupidity and weirdness from thebeginning to the end. It seems as if the makers of the movie were shorton budget. They have tried to think of some new concept but I am afraidthe plot as a whole is bleak. The acting was not that bad but the moviein itself was awfully horrible. I was hoping to have an enjoyable timebut rather I am hating myself for watching this crap and wasting mytime. My suggestion - Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!
