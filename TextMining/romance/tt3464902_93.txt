I struggle with the favorable reviews for this film. To call this aweird film does not do justice to weirdness. Do not waste your timewatching this disgusting film. It over uses pseudo intellectualpsychobabble to disguise pointless animal cruelty and an empty sterileplot. I anticipated a dry comedy and a creative tale aboutrelationships. Being an animal lover, I was looking forward to a filmthat explored the depth of relations a human can have with theunconditional love an animal has with its owner. Instead, the filmlacked any depth regarding relationships at any level, human or animal.Film critics may like it. I cannot fathom viewers liking it. The ideaof the film was very catchy. I believe the writers got lost along theway. I certainly did.
