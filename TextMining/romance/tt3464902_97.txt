I ordered two DVDs this week: "High Rise" and "The Lobster." In amiracle coincidence, they both ended up (it was a tie) as the worstmovies I have ever seen. I have seen thousands of movies over my longlife and these two movies challenge my brain to find the most fair butcritical terms I could use: "awful" is true; "stupid" is true; but"insipid" and "pretentious" are the most specific and accurate.No amount of money should have been enough for Farrell and Hiddlelstonto do these movies. (Although Hiddleston has done some cheesy stuff,e.g., "The Avengers." Colin gave some ridiculous testimonial about theuniqueness of the script and the directors' genius.Both movies stink. You've been warned.
