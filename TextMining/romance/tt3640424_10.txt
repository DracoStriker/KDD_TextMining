My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. It had been a while since wehad seen Brad Pitt in a movie and he is an accomplished actor. Hiscostar was beautiful and talented. They made for good eye candy as acouple. There was plenty of action across two different settings andtimes. It was not predictable or spelt out for you which is often thecase with American movies, The English seem to do a better job ofallowing the audience to fill in some gaps and silences. It kept usinterested and entertained throughout. Cinemaphotography was good withcolours and weather helping with the mood and atmosphere. For people who favour the spy genre set in wartime it is worth a fewhours of your time. It is a serious film that shows that lovetranscends everything!
