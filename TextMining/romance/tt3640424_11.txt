This is the kind of film I go in to with a very forgiving attitude.Historical dramas are among my top choices and it was fantasticwatching two of my all-time favorite stars trying to play multi-layeredcharacters and doing pretty good. Then Zemeckis decided to add cokeheads and other modern Hollywood projections in scenes of WW2 Britain.Not only was the language, behavior and attitude not historicallyaccurate, it was so distracting and unnecessary in a period piece.Beautiful cinematography and set pieces and a good story all ruined bya need to desecrate old, traditional behavior and values. And by theway, people in the 40's rarely said F but here it was in everysentence. Sad and disappointing.
