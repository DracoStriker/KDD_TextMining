There was no plot twist although there were several places for a plottwist. If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie. Also, the break fromthe period setting to give modern values with no point. Theintroduction of a sister to Brad Pitt's character, who is openly alesbian. This would NEVER happen in the 1940s as homosexuality wasagainst the law and they were greatly disdained by the public. It is acompletely pointless distraction from the period setting. Another goof,German Army officers wearing Nazi armbands. I was beginning to thinkQuinton Tarantino made this movie. Another example of how Hollywoodcannot make a period movie without sabotaging their own production.
