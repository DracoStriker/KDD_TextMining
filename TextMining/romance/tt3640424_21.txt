The film started off well.....even though I knew there would be a plotdevelopment coming later regarding the possibility of the wife being aspy for the Nazis. I didn't mind the story of how the two leads gottogether and ended up in Hampstead in the middle of the war. I didn'tmind waiting for the crisis to come up where Brad Pitt doesn't know ifhis wife is a spy or not. But once it does come up, Brad undertakessome pretty far fetched ventures that could undermine the Allies'security even in order to find out. I was even overlooking that. Whatfinally tore it was the way Brad's wife played by Marion Cotillardhandles her own dilemma and crisis. She could have sought help orguidance from Brad OR his superiors, totally versed in the very areasshe was struggling with. It indicates that she did not trust herhusband in spite of the lovey dovey marriage portrayed. Either that, orshe was simply a wimp and a wuss. This made the whole movie ratherunbelievable. As for the ending of the film with the letter to herdaughter especially, that was superfluous and heavy on the treacle, avery obvious attempt to tug at heartstrings in case the audiencedoesn't already GET that she really loved her daughter. Last straw, bythis time I really didn't care for the film.
