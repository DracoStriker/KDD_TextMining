Just like Fury, Allied is another Pitt Special - a war comic that wantsto be taken seriously.Apart from the wooden acting and the extremely long scenes of justtalking, this slow moving script that was probably written by a tenyear old is just so unbelievable.Please note that lots of spoilers follow.Why did Mr Pitt have to parachute into Casablanca? As a spy, he couldhave been much less conspicuous and caught the train.If his wife to be is such a careful and clever spy - as we are led tobelieve, why did she put Pitt's character on the spot by saying he wasa poker specialist?We then have the spectacle of Pitt's character cutting the cards like aprofessional magician (yawn), and off course being able to write downcomplex chemical compounds - in line with his cover. It appears thatfor a one minute assassination job, he has had around five yearstraining. Is there anything he can't do?If the British secret service think his wife is a spy, why tell him?Why not just bait the trap anyway!.The German soldiers are all presented as being zombie like gun fodder,when they actually were one of the most disciplined and efficientarmies. In real life, Mr Pitt's character wouldn't have got very farafter attacking the Germans in the town. Reinforcements would haveflooded the area.The anti aircraft fire over London was obviously taken from the bombingof Bagdahd in the 21st century. If you watch YouTube clips of WW2London AA fire it looked nothing like that.Why would you have a picnic next to a plane crash? Apart from the smellof aviation fuel, there would have been dead bodies in the wreckage.There are so many more stupid things in this movie, but I will justpresent my favourite for last.Mr Pitt turns into a Jedi near the end when entering the airfield withhis wife and child. The guard commander comes to the car window, I canimagine Brad waving his hand, and the Commander then says words to theeffect "They can pass."If you are thinking of paying to watch this movie, I would pass too.
