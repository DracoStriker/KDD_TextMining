This movie has it's entertaining moments but is generally pretty bad.Totally lacking any tension the scenes are predictable and don'tconnect well to each other. The script is awful, almost laughable. Thestereotypical British characters are embarrassing in a 4 weddings +funeral kinda way. The lesbian couple are pointless and seem to bethrown in there for PC reasons. Why does Brad Pitt turn into amannequin every time he is introduced to people? The plot is full ofholes...why did the German officer rush off to make a phone callinstead of arresting Max Vatan?...why would 2 dynamic and ruthlesskillers be allowed to lounge around London for a couple of years?Surely they could have been useful in North Africa or Italy!...How wasBeausejour allowed enter Britain, only for the British to laterdiscover she was dead? So much for their Gibraltar station!...why, upondiscovery, was she not used as a double agent, bearing in mind it was 2months before D- Day? Now that could have been interesting!
