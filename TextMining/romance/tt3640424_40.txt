Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard had zero chemistry together. Notkidding, I couldn't have been more uninterested in what might happen tothem. If Cotillard hadn't shot herself in the head in the end, I mighthave done it myself after a while.An openly lesbian relationship tolerated in Great Britain during the40's? When even Turing was prosecuted for homosexuality after he hashelped to crack the German Enigma machines? What kind of retarded PCthinking is this? What next? Napoleon explaining to his army that thereare more than two genders or Douglas MacArthur speaking out againstfat-shaming?Why did the British intelligence involve Brad Pitt in an exercise whichaimed to find out whether or not his wife is leaking secrets to theGermans? Couldn't they just phoned him him fake news anyway or was ittotally necessary to make things more complicated since an armydepartment sometimes likes to spice things up?If Brad Pitt managed to get a plane without anybody asking about itbefore the findings of the report on his wife, then why didn't he justput his entire family on a plane right then and flew away to a neutralterritory? Why wait for stuff to go dark since there was a genuinepossibility of that happening?Too many Casablanca references.
