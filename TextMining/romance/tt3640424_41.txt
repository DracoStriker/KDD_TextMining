Reading other reviews I wonder if we all watched the same movie. Fromthe very beginning movie felt like a total disaster. With Brad and themaker of brilliant " Forrest Gump"you will assume that you are in for atreat . How wrong was I. Absolutely wooden performance by all actors,terrible pacing, ridiculous decorations and laughable story that justdoes not make any sense. This movie does not deserve 1/10 rating.Whoever made this so-called movie should be really ashamed for makingsuch a turd.
