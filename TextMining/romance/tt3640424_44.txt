I saw this film on TV. I liked it but never thought it was a classic.Afterwards, I gave the plot some thought. It did not quite add-up. Theproblems begin when the British discover that there is a spy in theirmidst. The spy is female and married to Brad Pitt's character who is apatriotic, Canadian underground agent. When the spy is discovered, Pittis directed to kill his wife or it will be assumed that Pitt himselfmust be a spy.This puts the characters in an interesting no-good-way-out dilemma, butalas, it is a scenario that doesn't make a lot of sense. Does the actof Pitt's character killing his wife really prove that he too isn't aspy? But the thing I wondered about was: why shouldn't the British usethe Nazi spy to their own advantage by peddling false information tothe Nazis? Maybe that will be in a sequel. Sure, that's it.
