The Pitt - Cotillard duo works well and shows considerable chemistry.Cotillard, one of the most beautiful women in movies, lights up thescreen with enough charm and sensuality to tempt an eremite saint,aided and abetted by one of the most exquisite wardrobes seen theselast years. (I do hope that someone got an Oscar for the costumes. Thewedding dress alone deserves a place in a museum.)However, it might have been better if some of the imagination and carelavished on the costumes had been spared for other aspects. The movie,for all its burning airplanes and multicolored explosions, isn't allthat gripping, thrilling or moving. It isn't even all that convincing.For instance : try wrapping your head around the idea of seasonedintelligence and counterintelligence officers going on about top secretmatters while surrounded by a loud and chaotic party of the morebohemian kind. Who discusses capital secrets within possible earshot ofunsuccessful young poets trying to pour cheap sherry down your neck ? Moreover, it's a pretty good bet that such people didn't discusscrucial safety matters with their sisters, however sensible or brave orpatriotic these sisters may have been. Still, we should all be thankful that the depiction of intelligencework isn't all that realistic : if the various Allied espionage andcounterespionage services had thought and behaved like that in reallife, then the swastika flag would be flying in every country fromArctica to Antarctica... Fun note : the linguists among you can enjoy a wide range of accentsand pseudo-accents, some of which are so unhinged that they belong in apsychiatric ward. Sadly this fact doesn't count towards an extra star,although the line about "Your French is good, but your accent isn'tParisian enough" is comedy gold.
