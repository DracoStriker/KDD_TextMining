Watching this with someone who was of age during this time period wasextremely enlightening.The use of all the F-bombs was unwarranted and not common at the time.The public cameo of the lesbian sister was typical of progressiveintervention in all things Hollywood, but also, not common at the time,even in Europe. Some older English viewers will also have a problemwith the portrayals.Overall watchable but slow.
