Overall, my general opinion for this film was very positive. I went inexpecting nothing, and walked out feeling very satisfied. Sure the CGIand kinda slow first act took away from the overall experience, buteven I didn't notice one of the two until someone pointed it out to me.The real star of the show was the acting and story, and In the end Idecided to give Allied a "Very Good" on theVade Review Bar or a 9 outof 10. This is probably one of the best films I've seen all year, and Ihonestly considered giving it a Golden V or a 10 out of 10. Definitelygo out and see it if you haven't, as Allied will definitely be a film Iwill enjoy watching again and again.Read more at theVade.
