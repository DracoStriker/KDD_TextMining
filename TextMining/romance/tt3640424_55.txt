Really excellent film. Loved this from start to finish.The tension is at times almost unbearable - up there with BryanCranston in The Infiltrator.Brad Pitt & Marion Cotillard were really good. I'm not a Brad Pitt fanbut he really was top notch in this. The scenes in London's blitz werehighlights too. They looked spectacular.This really is a good World War II film and I can't recommend it highlyenough. Very solid 9 out of 10 for me
