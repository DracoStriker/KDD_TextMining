Casablanca, Germans, spies, La Resistance... how can you fail withthat? Well, something about Allied was off, whether it was thechemistry between the actors or the long setup before anything actuallyhappens or simply the bleak and understated finale. I don't know what Ididn't like, I just know that it was a movie I expected more of untilit ended and left me disappointed.Now, I can't say Brad Pitt didn't act well, but I am so used with hissmiling persona that I felt the icy spy role didn't fit him, made himlook old and sick. Marion Cotillard was OK, but something in her actingthrew me off at almost every scene. Jared Harris was awesome as always,but didn't have much of a role.The only thing remaining to discuss is the story, and I can't spoil ithere. It's intriguing and I believe it could have been developed intosomething more intense and interesting. As such, it was a movie withmostly exposition and very little character development.
