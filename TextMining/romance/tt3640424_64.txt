Here he meets French resistancefighter Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) working undercover inthe German embassy. She poses as his wife as they get close. After asuccessful mission, they go to London, get married and have a child.Later, as D-Day approaches, security and secrecy becomes an issue thateffects their life.Yes, I agree Angelina would have been better in the female lead, if notmore interesting. Max has a lesbian sister, also working in London. Itdidn't add anything to the film, but for some reason Hollywood feltthey needed to add it. The acting was top notch. The ending I didn'tsee coming, nor was it on my short list. The sadness of the film oflove, life, sacrifice, and the greater good perhaps plays into theaudience partial rejection as it leaves a bitter taste in their mouths.Guide: F-word, sex, brief side breast nudity.
