Robert Zemeckis plunges us into the set of WWII in a very Casablancastyle. Many scenes make you think of the Hollywood Golden-Age classic,although Allied is a much more dramatic movie that pictures the Frenchcollaborative Regime, Nazi Germany but also Canada, which is not acountry that is usually represented in WWII pictures. Actually I thinkit's the first movie that I've seen that puts the Canadian side asprotagonist. The photography is also very good. The shots that takeplace in the Moroccan desert, and in Morocco in a more general way, areprecious. They have very refined aesthetics and a subtle symbolism. Butthe big problem of this movie is the chemistry between the two leadactors. Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt may be great actors themselvesbut when both are together the chemistry just doesn't spark. Theromantic scenes they share are just missing a "je ne sais quoi" thathas a terrible impact on the movie. In my opinion it's what makes it agood movie but not a great one. It's really disappointing that solittle impacts so much.
