I have always felt that any movie with a love story set in Casablancahas an uphill battle to avoid being compared to Bogart and Bergman'sall time classic. I have to admit that was my first take, but kudos toPitt and Cotillard for drawing me in with compelling performances andwhen the plot turned to the the spy vs spy intrigue in London I wastotally into this flick. To say more is to give away a poignant plottwist that makes ALLIED a must see.
