Cotillard shines in every scene, but she alone cannot elevate thisfilm. This could have been a great film, but the direction must befaulted for the slogging pace. The biggest problem here is Brad Pitt.Even though I'm a big fan of his films, he acts half asleep in everyscene with no charisma at all. His portrayal ruins the film. Best topass on this.
