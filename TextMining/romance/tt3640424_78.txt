Please don't let those that KNOW History stop you from watching thismovie. There most definitely is a plot and many twists. It was a Hellof a lot better than Mr & Mrs Smith. I watched it twice to make sure Iunderstood everything and it will stay with you for a long time. Thereis a fine line between realism, art and reality, this movie has it all.The story is engrossing from the beginning to the end and it will stopyou in your tracks. Again, don't go for historical facts, go for theentertainment and an insight into the fear that captured everyone atthat time. It was real, it was scary and it really happened. Brad hasall that it takes to be the great Actor that he is.
