We watched this at home on BD from a Redbox rental. My wife actuallysaw it in the theater with her sisters.This is a very well made and interesting story. It is fiction but wasinspired by a real story during WW2 where a soldier got a womanpregnant and later found out she was a spy for the enemy.This movie never drags, is interesting all the way. The extras on thedisk are worthwhile, they reveal a lot about how the movie was made, acombination of real action shot against blue screen andcomputer-generated images, so well executed that it is difficult totell when it is being done.Brad Pitt is Canadian Max Vatan working with a British agency for theAllies during the middle of WW2. As the movie begins we see a missionhe is on to execute a group of Nazi officers in Casablanca. He isjoined by a French operative, Marion Cotillard as Marianne Beauséjour.The two represent themselves as a married couple from Paris.After that sets up the premise and the characters we move to Londonwhere the couple really do fall in love, get married, and have adaughter. It become a love story in the middle of espionage.SPOILERS: His superiors approach Max with the suspicion that his wifeis really an operative for the enemy, that she has taken the identityof a dead woman. They suspect her of sending messages to the enemy. Maxhas to cooperate to set her up, they will call with fake plans, he isto write the message on paper, and on Monday if the fake message hasbeen transmitted then they know it was her. In the end she is shown tobe the operative, but Max still loves her. His orders are to executeher but instead she uses a handgun to take her own life at the airfieldwhere Max was trying to steal a plane for the two of them to fly off tosafety. The official report was to state that Max had killed her so hewould not be executed also. At the end we see Max and his teenagedaughter walking in a field. Life and love are seldom simple.
