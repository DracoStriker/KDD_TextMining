This is a good film with a good second world war history reconstructionshowing the cities of Casablanca and London. The french actressprovides us a great interpretation of a double agent working forGermany and ally countries. The problem is with Brad Pitt that seems toperform himself not the British secret agent working to destabilizeGermany forces in north Africa. He seems he is not there. Maybe all ofus who love his intense actor's performance since the first movies wereexpecting more empathy with the Allies' main character. In short, thisis a very good story that needs a more intense actor to work it tobecome a romance. A perfect set was created but the actor did notprovide us his expected best.
