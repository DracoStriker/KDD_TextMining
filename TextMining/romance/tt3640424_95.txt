Stylish, sumptuous & steered by its reliable stars, Allied is a typicalRobert Zemeckis film. Packing lots of promise, exhibiting a verypolished surface, and keeping the interest alive for the most part yetin the end when the credits start rolling, there's nothing to take awayfrom it, the whole journey feels rather generic, and only thing thatleaves its trace is how beautiful its images looked.Set in 1940s during the World War II, the story of Allied follows aCanadian intelligence officer who teams up with an enigmatic Frenchresistance fighter for a suicide mission in Casablanca and pull it offsuccessfully. Starting a family together after reuniting in London,their relationship is put to the ultimate test when the husband isinformed by his superiors that his wife may be a German spy.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Flight, The Walk), the filmis gorgeous to look at and makes fab use of its refined sets & alluringcostumes from start to finish but the route it follows is a predictableone. It does get interesting when the element of doubt & suspicion isintroduced but the moment of revelation & its aftermath are so poorlyhandled that it nearly ruined the whole film.Although cleverly integrated, Visual effects play a major role innearly every Robert Zemeckis film and Allied is no exception.Cinematography enhances the images with its sharp focus & controlledmovements, Editing provides a steady pace but overly stretches itsending, Alan Silvestri chips in with a fitting score yet it looks as ifmajority of the film's budget was spent on its lavish costumes.Coming to the performances, Allied features an attractive cast in BradPitt & Marion Cotillard with Jared Harris, Simon McBurney & LizzyCaplan in supporting roles. The characters Pitt & Cotillard play aren'tas fleshed out as required but both actors play their partconvincingly, with the former bringing his natural charm into playwhile the latter dazzles with her sensual & mystifying quality.On an overall scale, Allied is highly sophisticated in the technicaldepartment and is suspenseful at times but still fails to leave alasting impression when it's all over. The charismatic leads do manageto overshadow few of its shortcomings & they both look really goodtogether but their relationship is never entirely convincing. Full ofcheesy moments & following a clichéd path, Robert Zemeckis' latest isentertaining for sure but nothing about it is new.
