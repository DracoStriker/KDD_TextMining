... and no I am not talking about the characters in the film, I amtalking about what happens when an A-list director "falls in love" withthe idea of doing a sexually explicit film.I want to be clear about this and I think the data will bear me out.Make a list of all the films in the last 100 years by A-list directorswho felt confident they could infringe on territory formerly occupiedonly by the porn industry and still prevail with a hit film...? Are youdone? I will save you time. I did the list myself. And the answer isnone, zero, zip, nada.Just like there are in the porn industry a handful of directors whoconstantly try to push the boundaries of their craft into themainstream (which almost always means soft light and lots of whitesheets, films that most resemble a commercial for TIDE) Noe, abrilliant artiste (Irreversible and Enter the Void were both brilliant)tried to push the envelope .. and ended up with junk mail.Sure, if you are determined to see a silk purse where others are seeinga sow's ear, you could pretend that this film has a great deal to sayabout men's expectations about love and marriage.But this is a review just between the writer and the reader, and werespect each other too much to lie. So I will be clear -- Noe wentwhere angels fear to tread. And ended up with a film that, forposterity, is simply not going to make his A-reel.
