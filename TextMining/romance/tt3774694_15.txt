Let's face it. Somehow this thing got legitimized by using moreexpensive film and hi tech movie equipment. I can just see the guyssitting there drooling because this is somehow a mainstream movie."Look, dear. This is an art film like the ones you are always talkingabout. I really don't see anything more than a bunch of explicit sexwhich I could pick up at any adult movie outlet if I wanted to. Ofcourse, it could have been redeemed if there had been something newabout it. The problem is that it is just plain boring. The charactersare tiresome and unappealing. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Yes,there is a bit of decent cinematography, but even that is pretentiousand "artsy." It takes away the simple presentation of the story (suchas it is), and when these flashy scenes show up, they are just suchobvious eye candy. Don't bother.
