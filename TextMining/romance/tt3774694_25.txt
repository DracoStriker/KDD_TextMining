I can not believe, I am going to be the first review of this film onIMDb. Cool! OK, to the review...I saw this film at the Cannes FilmFestival (Loved the festival and Cannes!) So, I and many others waitedfor at least an hour to watch this last showing at the festival. Themovie starts off with a bang - two people pleasuring each other! Andintermixed with the pleasuring there's arguing and lots of it. Thismovie is sex scene after sex scene with a little bit of plot inbetween. This film was also in 3D, so the "moneyshot" was a bit tooreal. The characters are somewhat interesting, but the motive behindthe relationships are very fragile. And I am not quite sure about theend. It is rather ambiguous. For the longest time, you have no idea howanyone is affording to live in Paris and what they do besides have lotsand lots of sex. After a while, it's not even sexy sex. And, to mysurprise, plenty of people walked out of the film well before it ended.I am glad I saw it. It was an experience, but "Porn"...I mean "Love"wasn't exactly a good movie. Also, I can't see this film playing inAmerican theaters. Even with strong editing, it'd be extremely graphic.
