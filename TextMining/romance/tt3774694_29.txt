I know I only rated it a seven out of ten but that's because I admitthis film's faults. It certainly isn't near perfect but I felt verymoved by the characters and their story. Lots of people may not be ableto relate to this film however those of us that do can say thateverything about this depiction of love has been experienced and isreal. As a grown single adult living in today's dating world I canattest that the relationship between Murphy and Electra exists. Theirobsession with each other and with sex that led them into a deep andpossibly unreal infatuation was honest and thought provoking. Lovesometimes doesn't make sense and can't be described or made logical.Their connection was what drove them into darkness, madness anddespair. Love is completely all consuming on any level it's representedon. So many times have I given myself up for something that a yearlater I looked back on and couldn't reconcile my behavior, and so manytimes have I given myself up to something to only sabotage it before itcompletely devoured me. I don't know if I have been in love, but I havefelt what these characters are going through and I wouldn't know whatelse to call it. In the vein of Harmony Korine and Lars von Trier Ithink Gasper Noe is a genius. Yes this movie is uncomfortable, yes theacting isn't great and yes the story is dry, but it's a genuine take onwhat relationships look like for some people in their mid twenties toearly thirties and I loved every second of it.
