The movie keeps repeating scenes and scenes of rumination and sex, asif the director was trying to fill up two hours, or thought he hadcreated some new pure cinema art form. It really gets tiring andsickening. Like the repeated shots of male ejaculation, one gets the feeling thatthe director was too cocksure of what he thought he was achieving, thusoverindulging it to the extreme.
