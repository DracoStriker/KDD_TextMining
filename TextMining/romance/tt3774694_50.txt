are these people crazy or what i mean what in the blue hell is this howis this even called a film & how did it get released i like eroticfilms but this is just pure garbage.love 2015 is a desperate attempt by the makers to sell porn in the nameof art sadly it fails.love is a wrong title this film should have been called lust,films likethese that justify wrong things in society should be banned.this is some sick fantasy or a pervert thats it there is no story inthis film just sex and vulgarity what can you say about a film thatopens with a hand job scene that lasts for 5 minutes.after watching this filth my reaction was crazy i wondered for a longtime about what was the reaction of people who saw this in thetheaters,can you imagine only.the main characters are biggest cheats ever the whole 2 hours they arehaving sex,clubbing & then more sex.the camera-work is lousy,music sucks & acting oh please don't ask allof the actors were terrible.i am believing for once second that someone actually wrote a script forthis nonsense.if you want a better film try some of those Shannon Tweed soft coremovies from 90s decade or if you want hardcore simply buy porn but stayaway from this stupidity.Love 2015 has nothing to see if you enjoy crass cheap cinema then thisis for you my rating is 1/10,its a waste of time and money.Skipp it
