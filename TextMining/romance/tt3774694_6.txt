Contains some of the hottest sex scenes ever filmed, thanks to thecombination of plausible courtship scenes, character development, andgraphic (at least partially non-simulated) sex. Many of the sex scenesare beautiful to the point you become aware of the cinematography,though I did not feel aware of the acting at any point. A lot of the melodrama could have been edited out without impacting theplot whatsoever, not to mention some parts that are downright abusiveto the viewer with blinding flashing lights, and, I suspect, some cheapabuse of 3D effects (I saw it in 2D), but then again this movieprobably couldn't exist without giving the director a ton of editorialfreedom. IMHO this is a must-see if you care at all about eroticism in film.
