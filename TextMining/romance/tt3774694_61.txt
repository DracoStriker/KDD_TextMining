Set in France, 'Love' is one of those arty films that features explicitsexual activity. Director Gaspar Noé reportedly said he wanted tocreate a film featuring a 'love story seen from a sexual point ofview'; did he succeed?The film opens with American student Murphy getting a handjob fromFrench girl Electra while he in turn fingers her - um - front bottom.This all seems very nice, but flash forward a few years and we seeMurphy living unhappily with a different Frenchwoman (Omi), the motherof his young child. How he got from pleasant afternoon handjobs todissatisfied (though responsible) domesticity forms the narrative ofthe film.There's a heavily improvised feel - and not just in the sex scenes: themore routine conversations are well played, but the frequentarguments/shouting matches are unfocused and boringly repetitive. Leadactors Karl Glusman, Aomi Muyock and Klara Kristin - the latter twoapparently never having acted before being cast in this film - arecompetent (when they're not shouting). Muyock, especially, does acreditable job in showing Electra's rapid descent from wholesomestudent to attention-seeking slapper. The sex scenes are not the coldaffairs some reviewers report them to be: true, they're not the heightof eroticism, but they're enjoyable enough, with all three leadslooking attractive sans clothes.And although the film being shot in 3D didn't add anything for me, Ihave to admit it made for an unusual money shot...
