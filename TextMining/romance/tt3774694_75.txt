Love hits you straight out of the box with the first scene. The sex wasreally, really graphic. I saw this movie in 2D and I can only imagine.I could not before, thinking to myself why would they make a romancemovie in 3D?, but now I don't need to imagine, I can never get thoseimages out of my head. They really went extreme.But I will say that I thought the sex scenes got me more emotionallywrapped up in the movie than the actual acting. I did like how a lot ofthe movie was about what is being shown and the action taking place,but I did not like the actors too much as they read their dialog, whichsucks for them considering what they had to do on screen.Overall, I did find the the movie appealing. It reminds me of anothermovie with hardcore sex scenes, 9 songs, but instead this story aboutthe run of a relationship is not linear, which is what made this movieinteresting.It was a little hard for me to watch at times but I thought it was welldone.
