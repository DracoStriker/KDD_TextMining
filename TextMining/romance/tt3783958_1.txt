The last time, I felt like this, in a cinema, I was six years old and Iwas watching Star Wars. I never imagined, I would ever find thatfeeling again in a cinema. That sense of being transported to anotherworld. The opening sequence took my breath away and I never got it back. Noteven at the end - which left my head spinning. It is a beautiful filmwith soul, wit, charm, style and love. It is simply outrageous! Boldand fantastic and fantastical. I am a straight man but my love for Ryan Gosling could change all that.He's a melancholy genius and Emma Stone is our muse. This film defies genre. It is a masterpiece. I urge you to see it. Iwas lucky enough to see it at the BFI London Film Festvial. It has been five days since I saw La La Land and I am still thinkingabout it and singing the haunting refrain that plays with your soul. Imean it gets in there - that music - the music of the firmament. Flyingstill, dreaming still... thank you Damien.
