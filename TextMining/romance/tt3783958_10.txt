This film will disappoint you. Here are the reasons why:1. Its apparently supposed to be a movie musical, yet BOTH RYAN GOSLINGAND EMMA STONE ARE BELOW AVERAGE SINGERS. I couldn't quite get pastthis point. It is astonishing that two below par singers could becasted in a movie musical? It is a heavy contradiction to the genre offilm it attempts to portray.2. Both RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE ARE BELOW AVERAGE DANCERS. Similarto the singing complaint, i was unable to be captivated and fullyimmerse myself in the movie/musical 'magic' because i was too busycringing at their dance performance.3. The STORYLINE WAS NOT CAPTIVATING. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy,because of respective careers they don't end up together? Fin4. THE STORYLINE WENT FLAT IN THE MIDDLE. The middle of the filmdragged, for obvious reasons which is that the story line was to weakto maintain the intensity.5. RYAN GOSLING'S CHARACTER IS ACTUALLY VERY ANNOYING A jazz fanaticthat forces it down everybody's throat, including the girl he isdating. He was superior to others because of his love for jazz. Hethrust jazz upon her, and because of that i never really for oncebelieved in the film that she had organically grown to love jazz as herlove for him also developed. Instead it seemed as if she had to pretendto like jazz as a pre- condition to their relationship.6. The HYPE AROUND THIS FILM DOES NOT MATCH THE QUALITY OF THE FILM Theexpectations were simply way to high for this average film. I mean, ithas 8.6 on IMDb for goodness sake!!Although it is subjective, in my opinion, this film comes nowhere closeto a great film or musical. In conclusion, shame on 'Hollywood' and somany once respected critics endorsing this film as one of, if not the'greatest musicals' of all time. Furthermore, shame on movie lovers andsociety in general not having the balls to suggest the clear truthwhich is that this is clearly a very average film at best. Big Shame!
