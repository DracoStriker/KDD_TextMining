Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, fromFederico Fellini to Jacques Demy. Hallellujah! Ryan Gosling and EmmaStone go back to inspire us forward. What's more surprising thananything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in thesinging. So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience. DamianChazelle' Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions.I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something likeShadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story likeMidnight Lace. That's what happens when we discover a new and startlingtalent. You want to see him do everything. I have a feeling this youngartist will.
