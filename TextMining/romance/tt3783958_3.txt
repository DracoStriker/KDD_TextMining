I was greatly looking forward to this movie.I had read many reviews and they all seemed very positive.In fact when I read my newspaper's critique is was given 4/4 which is unusual. How let down I am. This was the worst movie I have seen this year.And we saw it in a VIP theatre.It was so slow moving that I felt myself falling asleep. I kept looking at my watch saying "only another 1/2 hour." Ryan Gosling cannot really sing & dance.And Emma Stone may be very photogenic & a good actress but she also is not much of a singer/dancer.There are wonderful musicals such as The amazing "West Side Story",the wonderful "Grease' Chicago was terrific to watch also as well as "Hairspray" with Jennifer Hudson & 'Mama Mia" with Meryl Streep.But this mess was a dud. The plot was simple but its execution was a dismal failure.I cannot figure out all the accolades this movie is getting from the Golden Globes,critics,& user reviews. A few hours after this film,I cant really remember anything worthwhile.Do not waste your money on this film whatever the critics say.It is boring,non believable,& you wont really care about the characters.
