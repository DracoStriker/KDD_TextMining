I saw this movie because of all the Oscar hype (how can a movie havemore Oscar nominations than The Godfather?). I read the negativereviews and wanted to make up my own mind. The negative reviewers wereabsolutely right. In time, movie reviewers will look back on this movieas a 2017 aberration and wonder- what were they thinking? Did someoneput something in the water? The plot is juvenile, cliché Hollywoodstruggles, about making it 'big'. Grow up! The plot reinforces racialstereotypes about the white guy being the purist and the black guyswork for him. What the! The main characters can't sing or dance (I hadto stop myself from laughing- what an insult to the greatness of pastmusical performers) Needs extensive editing. So many unnecessary longpensive moments. Filler shots. The special effects were so lame. (Egyou could see Emma Stones harness bulking up her waistline). Couldn'tmake out the lyrics in the jumbled mess of the opening number.Contrived pause to allow the audience to applaud. Unrealistic coybehaviour of the two leads as they fall in love- what the! (Are theytweennies? Is this set in current times or not?). Throughly,absolutely, forgettable.
