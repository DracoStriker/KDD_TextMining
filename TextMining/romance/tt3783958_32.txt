So first of all, if there weren't this much marketing about the movie,if the movie hadn't won 6 Oscars and if people around me didn't thinkso high of it, I would have been fair and given La La Land a 3 or a 4.But when raising expectations this much, it is just impossible to givea better grade than 1!The movie is one of the most boring I've seen in the past years. thefirst scene is sooo embarrassing I was so close to leave the theatre. Ishould have. The story line is flat. It can be summarized in two lines.La la land is cheesy and unlyrical. If you want to produce a musical,teach your actors how to dance. I mean an average dancer could probablydo better.The cinematography is supposed to be wow, but to my eye they completelyoveruse the use of colours. For me a good mise en place in a good movieis the one that your eyes like without you realizing which elementsmake it this way until you stare for a moment. La La land was tooobvious to me. The use of widescreen is hollow. The whole thing isgimmickry.While adding an old Hollywood look to a modern day movie is original,it just isn't my thing. What's the purpose? to connect to the oldmusicals? he wishes...Also a small detail, why the hell is Mia's dressing so ugly?????
