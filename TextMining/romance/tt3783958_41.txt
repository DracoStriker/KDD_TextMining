This movie is not good. The high reviews are probably studio people orfriends and family of all the cast & crew involved in this film! Ireally like both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, but neither can carry atune in this movie! I'm not saying these two needed to be Shirley Jonesand Frank Sinatra, but at least find 2 people that can sing!! We knowEmmy Rossum can sing and they could have cast Patrick Wilson. For amusical, it's not just star power, the leads have to be able to sing!(or at least dub some beautiful voice in, like they did for NatalieWood in West Side Story).Plus, the story is quite boring and very slow. Girl meets boy, girlgets boy. Girl loses boy. (Yawn!!) Then there's the issue of maybe onlyone semi-catchy tune, add that to the boring story and you've gotyourself a snooze-fest. Which no self respecting "musical" should everbe. JK Simmons is really good in the 2-3 minutes he's in the movie, but noone else is even remotely memorable. In a role any male actor couldhave played, they waste Tom Everett Scott. By the way, the openingproduction number is very clever, but the song is not good by anymeans. I've already forgotten the tune or even the name of the song!The story isn't worth summarizing here as it's too boring to repeat.Very, very disappointing! Don't waste your money and wait for it to hitcable.
