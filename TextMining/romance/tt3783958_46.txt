very mediocre and totally unforgettable songs sung by actors notsingers. Not good dancers trying hard, with bad choreography,the storyis pitifully bland with no real credible plot and an even worse ending.I know many people have rated this highly, far too highly in myopinion, but to balance that I have heard from many people who were sovery disappointed and some even left during the film.. The 1/10 isbecause of the very high mark it has, maybe I should have given a morereasonable mark 2/10 no more, just over 2 hours of my life lost that Icannot ever get back.... I think maybe it is a "Kings new clothes"where people just follow the bandwagon frightened to say LA LA Land themovie was and still is pretty bad...
