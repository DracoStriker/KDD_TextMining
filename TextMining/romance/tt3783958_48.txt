We left in the middle. I personally hate musicals. It look stupid forme to see people singing to each other . Why not talking ? Purestupidity. Can't understand the high rating for that silly film. I hearit is nominated for some Oscars ???? How come ? Evan for musicallovers, there is nothing special in that movie.
