It seems not too many know the French director Jacques Demy's films,especially his musicals like 'The young girls of Rochefort' or 'Theumbrellas of Cherbourg' or 'Donkey Skin' - nor Michel Legrand, whoscored these as well as many other films. Those were made in the late60ies and 70ies. They are available on Netflix - highly recommended!Obviously the director of LaLaLand watched them over and over again buthe failed totally in recreating them and transporting them into ourtimes. I find the music of LaLaLand with the exception of its main song ratherforgettable, the same with most of the choreography. The lead actorsare OK, but I don't see any depth. The story line is rather thin, verycookie cutter and weighed down by too much sentimentality.
