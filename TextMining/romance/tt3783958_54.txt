Given my love of both movies and musicals, I had such high hopes for LaLa Land.But alas, it was not to be.The good news is that the cast and production values are excellent.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are as likable as can be, and the stagingof the production numbers is amazing.Ah, but there's bad news. There's just no chemistry between Gosling andStone, and since their relationship drives the movie, this is a seriousproblem. Another problem is that neither of them are very good singers.And then there's the musical numbers, which just feel amateurish. ("Mymom can make the costumes, we'll use your dad's garage, and we'll writethe musical numbers!")Last but not least, at 2:18, it goes on forever.There's no good reason to see this movie at all. If you're curious,wait for the DVD / streaming, and then watch it with the sound off asyou read a good book.
