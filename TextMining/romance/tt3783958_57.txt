I love musicals, but I must have missed the stand in the theater wherethey were handing our the cool-aid for this one. Sorry, but I grew upmusicals entertaining life and work, but this is corns. None of the"stars" are the expected style or quality. The story is grotesquelypoor and without logic. Gosling is pathetic, I was left with the desireof someone who closes the keyboard cover in their hands, the voice ofthe stones allow you to pray for a good dose of pharyngitis. In shortsinging or even dancing the promotional machine Hollywood continues totell us how great it is and people believe it. In short I lost 2 hours,7 minutes and 3 seconds of my life. For our summer trips to Australia,it is almost as bad as the passengers.I think it must be an exercise in navel-gazing, as the awards bodiessee themselves in these two characters. Haven't they all struggled toget auditions? Haven't they all had screen tests? Haven't they alltried to "make it" in Hollywood? of course they have. The awards giverslike looking at themselves in the mirror. Personally I do not like whatthey see. Don't bother wasting your energy, or you will quit halfwaythrough, as I did. 0 out of 10.
