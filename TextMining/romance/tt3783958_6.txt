Sorry but I grew up living and loving musicals but this is tripe. Noneof the "stars" are of the expected style or standard. The story isgrotesquely poor and without logic. Gosling is pathetic, I kept wantingsomeone to slam the keyboard cover down on his hands, Stones voice leftme praying for a good dose of pharyngitis. In short neither can sing ordance yet the Hollywood promo machine keep telling us how great it isand people believe it. In short i wasted 2 hours, 7 minutes and 3seconds of my life. For our Australian summer releases it rates nearlyas bad as Passengers.Don't bother wasting the ticket money.
