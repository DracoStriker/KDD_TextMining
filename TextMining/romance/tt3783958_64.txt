It is flashy and colorful and the acting is good - the dancing andsinging not so much, some of the music is really well placed ifforgettable. But it is a movie that pretends for 128 minutes to besomething it is not. It is not a musical. It tries to be. But it forgets 20 minutes in andthen remembers in the end for one wonderful classical musical scenethat would be brilliant if it was all that La La Land was. But therest, is not really a musical. Mostly because while it doesn't lackmusic it lacks music numbers. And the ones it has feel mostly out ofplace and there only so a bland love story can be called something moreinteresting. It is a movie with music. Not particularly good musiceither. There are two numbers that stuck with me for longer then thelength of the movie. The rest might work within the story but doesn'tmanage to stand on its own.The movie also pretends to be original. Which it is not. There has beenstories like that. And better ones. The characters are not sympathetic either. He is snobbish andself-centered and even in his growth remains a jerk. She has no ideawhat she wants and while she pretends to grow she remains a child. Ifthe actors were any less charming and worked less well together I wouldbe rooting for them to get slapped for half the movie. It made caringif they stay together or not and watching their struggles and theirhappy moments much less involved. And uninvolved audience is notsomething you are striving for as a story teller. And the ending of the movie, don't even let me start on that. I wassomewhat looking forward to it despite the movie's flaws and then themovie slapped me in the face and spit on itself and me as well. I endedup feeling lied to and took for a fool. I have seen two wonderful movies that same week and going out of La LaLand it was everything a movie should not make you feel. Disappointed.Mislead. Empty. Just like the movie is.
