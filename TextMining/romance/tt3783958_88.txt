This has to be the most overrated movie of all time and it nowhere neardeserves this attention and surely none of the hyped awards. La La Land is a cute story, mediocre movie and has some nice dance andmusic scenes, but THAT IS ABOUT IT! The singing of Emma Stone and Ryan Gossling is absolutely a joke andfalls flat entirely. It does not reach the quality of Moulin Rouge orother film musicals like Dream Girls. Well, maybe it isn't even amusical at all and they happen to just sing a bit. I can not understand the hype and accolades this movie gets!Most overrated and boring movie of all time!
