This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I cannotunderstand people who are raving about this film saying it's one ofbest! Ever heard of Shawhsank Redmemption, LA Confidential,Godfather??? And don't get me wrong I like musicals. Mary Poppins,Sound of Music are terrific. But this?! I wanted to run out after halfan hour. Whiplash was OK and far better than this nonsense. Don't wasteyour time. I am a jazz musician so naturally I'm critical of the music.There was nothing memorable about any of the tunes. I am also a hugeRyan Gosling fan but he was totally wasted in this part. We went tothis film with a few other couples and the the best review one of usgave was that it was "OK".
