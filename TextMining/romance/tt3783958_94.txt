I've read 8 great reviews on this film. I went and saw the movie lastnight, and I'm usually a very positive person, but was verydisappointed. The highly ranked reviews must be from Sunshine Pumperswho are desperate for a comeback of a 1940's musical, or don't have aclue about a great musical:("Chicago", "West Side Story", "MoulinRouge", "Grease", "Singing in the Rain", "Cabaret", "Oklahoma", "Kingand I" etc. etc. etc.) None of the songs were catchy or memorable. Thegood: Emma Stone did some very good acting. Also the sets werecreative, and colorful. Miscast: Ryan Gosling, he can't sing. (think ofa 25 year old stoic Kevin Costner) He would have been better type castin a sports, western, buddy movie, mystery, gangster, or in a drama.Most likely cast as eye candy for the 18 to 24 year old gals. Theopening scene is a hot, sweaty LA traffic jam on the freeway, where 50or more people jump out of their cars, and start dancing and singing.It's a long non-stop shot that is VERY difficult to film. (think ofOrson Welles: "Touch of Evil") but we have all been there, no fun,brought back bad memories of heavy traffic jams, and I just couldn'tsee the fun in a traffic jam. It's like I wouldn't want to see a songand dance scene of a ER room or of Anne Frank. No memorable classiclines: ('Show Me the Money", "You'll Shoot Your Eye Out Kid", "There'sNo Crying in Baseball". Folks, this film will be forgotten in a year.Don't expect the next coming of "The Sound of Music". This is a poorman's Woody Allen movie!
