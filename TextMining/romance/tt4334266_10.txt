Ever since I've watched "A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)" thismovie has been on my radar. Ana Lily Amirpour is clearly one of themost interesting new directors out there and her next projects shouldbe anticipated. I'm glad to see big name actors like Keanu Reeves andJim Carrey in her movie, they play their parts brilliantly and willpull a bigger audience. Suki Waterhouse and Jason Mamoa are the maincharacters and keep you interested the whole way through, but the starof the show is director Ana Lily Amirpour. Her visuals and worldcreating are definitely the biggest pull of the movie.This movie will probably be watched by the wrong audiences, because offamous actors in it. It's a visual art movie which can be enjoyed byanyone, but is definitely not mainstream. A lot of reviews I see aboutthe movie being to slow are clearly that mainstream voice. It's kind offunny that the people who love "slow" artsy movies have to get throughthe gory cannibalism and murder scenes. You can see how that can splitaudiences.The style reminds me of Quentin Tarantino in the sense that theart-house and exploitation genre are combined a little. The bigdifference between Ana Lily Amirpour and Tarantino is that Tarantinocan catch that mainstream audience as well. If I knew more about whymovies are successful I could tell you why, but I can't help but feelthat it has something to do with the fact that this movie has a femaledirector. At least fans of good movies will make this a cult movie, butI really think it deserves more.I cant wait for the next movie Ana Lily Amirpour makes.(9/10) Would recommend.
