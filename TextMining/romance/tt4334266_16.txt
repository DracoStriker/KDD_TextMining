A minor criminal is exiled to a fenced off wasteland that used to bepart of Texas with all the other undesirables (a la Escape From NewYork) and is immediately captured by cannibals. After her escape, theonly safe place to go is a camp where a sex/drug cult leader isbuilding his paradise and trying to impregnate as many followers aspossible. The main character doesn't exactly love this setup either, soshe at first goes looking for revenge on the cannibals, but ends upkidnapping the daughter of one of them, and the father comes lookingfor her.I'm kind of surprised so many people didn't like this. It wasn't billedas a big action sci-fi kind of movie, and it's not. The director, AnaAmirpour, has been compared to Tarantino, but I feel she's the exactopposite of Tarantino. He's all about lots of dialog, skipping aroundin the story line, very little in the way of visuals, lots of jokes,etc. This is slow paced, very little dialog (almost none really), butit's telling a story in the style usually called "realism" where thetextures of the world come through. It's a very good soundtrack, greatvisuals, the director makes full use of sight and sound to tell thestory, which I have to say is what cinema, as opposed to books andradio, is all about.It doesn't really have a straightforward plot with a simple conflict orobvious good and bad guys, but the director is not known for thoseHollywood style movies at all. She's known for being veryunconventional (her other big film was an Iranian vampire western) sojust expect that it's going to be a weird film.
