I was excited to see this movie after reading the synopsis a couple ofdays before the screening. As the title of this summary suggests, thereis a lot of walking in this movie. The story starts out semi promisingwith you wondering what happened to the earth but ends up being thewalkiest and least talkiest movie I've ever seen. I know those aren'twords but goddammit they get my point across. The main actress is forgettable, Jason Momoa, Jim Carrey, and KeanuReeves were miscast or maybe it was just the bad script? Possibly both?Back to the walking part, with minimal dialogue and no actionwhatsoever, this movie becomes a student film really quick. What I meanis that they don't cut out all the walking around and other uselessscenes that should have obviously been taken out. There isn't really a story, it's sort of tried to take elements fromMad Max and other post apocalyptic films that are much better than itand hope the audience notices and doesn't care or doesn't notice atall.My suggestion: don't see it unless you want to be bored to death.Seen at TIFF 2016.
