I don't think this is a spoiler. What was the point of the making ofthis movie? I made it through the whole movie only because I fastforwarded the gruesome parts. I think the only thing I "liked" aboutthis film was involving the little girl and the determination of Arlen.My heart sank for Arlen and everything she faced.
