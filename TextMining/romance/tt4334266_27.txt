This film is an interesting lot. In a many respects, I want to dislikeit. I want to vote it down, because I feel it was truly made to wastetwo hours of a person's life. It has a thinly constructed main plotline that never really goes anywhere and lacks the investment of timein character details that could have made the development of theoverall film, much more interesting. The great thing about this movie? I fell asleep three times during it,and stayed asleep each time! Nor did I have much trouble going back toit either. I was literally that invested in the cinematic tapestry, andsubtle hints of deeper story just waiting to be scratched. The film isquiet, surreal, and in many cases intricate and interesting, even if itlacks a central story arc worth the overall investment. And the factthat you can sleep to it? Not many films can offer that sort ofpeaceful bliss.
