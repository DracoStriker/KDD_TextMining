This appears to be a movie about a future where members of the prisonpopulation are cast out into a apocalyptic desert wasteland. There aretwo settlements in the movie, a set of cannibals who I guess are thebad guys (sort of) and a settlement of non-cannibals who appear to havea more moral stance in terms of not eating people, offering a bit ofhelp to those in need and not casting people out for being extremelyodd. There are a few nods to what actually transpired/is transpiringbut nothing concrete. **spoiler alert** At the end of the film the maincharacter appears to opt to choose to live with a cannibal who ate someof her limbs rather than staying in the relatively safe havenapparently controlled by cultish leader "The Dream". Not really surehow much logical sense this makes as in the non cannibal settlementthey have have Uzis's and other weapons along with an heir of civilityand certainly no one brutally sawing limbs off living human beingswhich are then cooked and eaten. But each to their own I guess.There are certainly areas of this story which could have been explainedbetter, there are sections of the film that drag on a little whereasthere are sections that simply skip large time periods in which morelight could have been shed on what is actually going on. This may wellbe deliberate and certainly gives scope for the viewer to use their ownimagination to construct large areas of the plot in their own mind,it's debatable whether or not this is a good thing.In summary - This is not a terrible film nor is it a finishedmasterpiece. If one can get through some horrific scenes and isn'texpecting too much it's probably worth a watch, it has it's moments ofbrilliance and no shortage of sections that will one would expect todraw a large amount of criticism.
