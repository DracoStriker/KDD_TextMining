Wow, where do I begin? The first 20 minutes or so were promising butthen the movie starts to fail fast and never recovers. I only watchedit because of Keanu but right now Keanu you've betrayed me man, it's atotal mess of a movie. It seems like it desperately wants to be Mad Max with a touch of Beautyand the Beast, and most definitely it wants to be seen as a "cultclassic" but it never will be. The whole movie could have been done in 20 - 30 minutes. Take the firstpart of the movie, up to where she does that thing that causes JasonMomoa to come looking for her, delete the rest...The End..that wouldhave been a great movie. The acting skills seem off, the lead actress has the personality of atissue, no one really seems to sound convincing when they deliver theirlines, if they even have lines because there really isn't that muchdialogue, which would be fine but they don't convey anything via bodylanguage or facial expressions either...I didn't care about any of thecharacters..well maybe the little girl but even then not really....theonly good thing about this movie was Jason Momoas gorgeous physique.Just film that dude for a couple hours, walking round the desertwithout the pretend story line and it would be loads better than thismovie.
