I typically like post-apocalyptic movies and TV shows. I don't mind thepremise of the movie, but nothing about it grabbed my interest, exceptthat it was so bad (and with its cast) that I figured it had to getgood at some point. It didn't. Lack of action and dialogue was bizarre,to say the least. Maybe if they had cut out the little dialogue thatthere was it could have fallen into a silent movie category and hadsomething. I'm left with a void trying to explain how I feel about it.I suppose that is how I feel about.
