This "movie" is TERRIBLE!! It's a disgrace. I can't believe that Iwatched this "movie", I have never felt so angry and stunned aboutwatching a movie ever before. I really don't understand why Jason Momoaand Keanu Reeves decided to play in this "movie". There is not onepositive thing to say about this "movie". It's pure garbage because:- For starters, we don't get to know any of the characters and theirbackstories at all. They barely even talk, I think this movie containsabout 5 minutes of dialogue. And even that dialogue sucks. - The movie just randomly starts and continues without any explanationabout why this dystopia came about. Nothing ever gets explained?! Thismakes the whole movie a total mess and utterly worthless. - None of the actors were convincing, they're actually very laughablebut at the same time painfully boring to watch.- This whole movie could have been made in half an hour, there isalmost no dialogue and literally nothing happens! Everything takes waytoo much time, we see people walking, people walking, people walkingand a lot of boring desert shots. Oh and some hipster music. THAT'S IT.- I think the goal was to make some kind of art-house movie, but thisfailed BIG TIME. This movie has no meaning to it at all. - After already 10 minutes it became pretty clear to me that this moviewas gonna suck. The movie is trying to be "different and weird" sohard, it's just depressing and shameful to watch. - This is supposed to be a romance/sci-fi?? This is hilarious, there isno romance and no sci-fi. The only category this movie can be linked tois garbage. - I watched the entire movie, just to see if anything would happen andif in the end the movie would make any sense; well NO!!!!!Please do not watch this movie, it will make you angry and sad. It'sabsolutely the worst movie I have ever seen, even Twilight would be amasterpiece compared to this "movie".
