I decided to check this out only because Keanu Reeves was in it. Itwasn't worth it.This movie is just gross and puts out negative vibes but worst of all,it is extremely boring. It does a poor job of ripping off other movies and tries really hard tobe "art" but comes off as dull and pretentious.This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage.
