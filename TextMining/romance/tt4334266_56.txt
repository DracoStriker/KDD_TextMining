In the first 10 minutes of the movie, I'm getting a Mad Max meets KillBill vibe...only for that hope to completely dissipate in the following20-30 minutes. A silent film has more outstanding dialogue than thismovie did. I was fascinated by the characters..until they opened theirmouths (which wasn't even that often). I mean...I REALLY think therewere less than 800 words total in this movie. I was digging the "hey,we're gonna just place you in the middle of this story...and you canfigure it out" kind of approach, but...I was left questioning SO manythings by the time credits rolled. If you want to watch an "artsy"flick, with absolutely no substance to it...sure...go ahead. Iunderstand Jason Mamoa is eye-candy, and Keanu is Keanu... I justwonder how proud of the completed film they are.
