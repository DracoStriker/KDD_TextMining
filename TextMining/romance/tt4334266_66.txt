A very interesting movie that at first glance seems boring, but itneeds to look a little deeper into things. For example, today's trendis everywhere in the world that people exercise bodybuilding, and asthe main source of protein is meat, so we begin to look like cannibals.Everyone is strong, enjoying music, and only "meat" is important. Onthe other hand, there are those who are weaker and injured bybodybuilders, which in real life manifests as if they are not handsome,but they are nevertheless complex and have some kind of entertainment.And there is also a love story that connects incompatible, which tellsus that physical appearance is not important in life, but what someonedoes for us - for us. The saying "never say never" is present here andthis is seen by a girl who wanted to hurt Miami Man first, but laterfell in love with him. Although the world is a desert and a desertedworld, there is hope for them, and they will never be handed over atthe price of everything, while in the real world it is increasinglyimportant for us, for example, of material things (whether the guy hasa car, apartment, and of course money) After that follows something(feeling).This is my view of the film, which is a bit boring, but when we look alittle better about the things in the movie and we alter the realityand sadness we will see a lot of similarities and a lot of educationalthings.
