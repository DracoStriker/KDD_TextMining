If you walk out of a movie and still think about it days later, that'swhen you know you have found a good thing. It hasn't left my mind.This was a wildly addictive roller coaster ride! A truly breathtakingexperience that had me unexpectedly laughing out loud at the very lastscene. The slow parts went unnoticed to me because I spent most of thattime lapping up the dry, desert landscape. The desert has always been anightmare to me, symbolizing destitution and extreme survival-ism. Whenour heroine was released into the empty abyss in the very start, I feltoverwhelmed with the feeling of not just desperation, but extremeisolation as well.I enjoyed how unpredictable this was. The storyline was basic, butenough to drive the movie forward and the characters too. Keanu Reevesreally shined in this. Though he wasn't a huge character, whateverscenes he did have were brilliantly done. Momoa's presence was strongtoo, overshadowing Suki Waterhouse every time they were presenttogether. I would have loved if there was more time between them tojustify labeling it a love story. At the same time, with the directionthe story ultimately took in the end, I think it wasn't her affectionfor the big guy that pushed her to do what she did, but the human basicinstinct of wandering that did.We are all wanderers, and yet we live our lives trapped in one fixedpoint to survive one day after the next. I felt this movie highlightedthat when Waterhouse took refuge in Comfort, yet couldn't stop herselffrom wandering out every so often. I truly enjoyed every character on screen. Jim Carrey was on point! Iloved that he too was a wanderer, moving from one point to the next.Without giving it away, I am happy with how it ended. Though there wereplot holes, I didn't let them deter my experience in the slightest. Iknow this film is not your typical mainstream film, and it will be loston most of the viewership, but give it a try and decide for yourself! Sometimes odd is good!
