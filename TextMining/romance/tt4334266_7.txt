Hoo boy. This movie requires some effort. What starts off as a brutalexploitation flick, surely to weed out the meek, evolves into anabsorbing treatise on primal human conditions in a barren, desertedwasteland.While Ana Lily Amipour's sophomore effort contains pulpy roots,littered with outrageous characters and circumstances, it also tacklessome grand topics. Our white trashy heroine Arlen is unceremoniouslyturfed out of society to fend for herself behind a Texan fence, wherelawlessness and depravity are the rule of the day. She is soon capturedby a tribe of cannibals, and mayhem ensues.Dystopian futures as these don't seem all that far fetched any more."The Bad Batch" may serve as a warning, but chiefly it serves as dustyentertainment. Much like the "Mad Max" franchise, it is a world full ofcrazies scrambling to survive in glorious sunbaked vistas. Sporting a primo porn stash, Keannu Reeves pops up as a bizarro, robeclad cult leader. Giovanni Ribisi slips in several rambling, asylumescapee diatribes, but it is an unrecognizable Jim Carrey whoabsolutely steals the movie as a wizened bag man."The Bad Batch" has the art junk, lost inhibition, drug and music orgyfeel of Burning Man, and because it's stealthily asking toughquestions, has much more going for it than the cheap veneer mayindicate.
