This is a really beautiful film and - most importantly - it's real,actual, solid cinema as opposed to the tons of commercial, repetitive,mainstream crap we're (unfortunately) flooded with. This review couldend here, because it's something you have to see for yourself.There's a caveat, though: as for every real movie, "The Bad Batch"requires you to have the SKILL of watching a film. You have to work*with* the movie in order to enjoy it, which means your brain must beON. If you are the kind of viewer who thinks movies should be mindlessentertainment to switch your mind off for a couple hours, who needs tobe guided through a story, hand-holded by expositional dialogue andstereotyped characters, then I strongly suggest you turn to somethingdifferent: the Fast & Furious franchise, or Marvel Cinematic UniverseMovie #17 may be a more apt choice, for you.Here you'll find strong acting performances, a beautifully craftednarrative that relies on visuals way more than on dialogues, a greatsoundtrack, a chiseled editing and lots and lots of great smallmoments, ranging from horrifying to dramatic, from comedic to romantic,from bitterly satiric to endearingly sweet.It's a great cinematic experience all around which, as cherry on top,also has something to say about the world we live in. So do yourself afavor, watch it, and decide for yourself if you like it or don't :-)
