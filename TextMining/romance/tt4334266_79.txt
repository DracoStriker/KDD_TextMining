I really enjoyed Ana Lily Amirpour's first (non-short) movie, A GirlWalks Home Alone At Night. It felt like it knew what it wanted to beand had some real atmosphere to it. In contrast, this movie feels veryunder-written and has an underwhelming lead. Suki Waterhouse is goingfor some kind of accent but certainly doesn't work. Jason Momoa doesn'tfare much better as his character is inexplicably Cuban and strugglingthrough a "Cuban" accent. Jim Carrey is in this movie. He does notspeak nor do I know why he wanted to be in this movie. I guess it wasprobably 1 or 2 days of work judging from his screen time. Keanu Reevesfares the best in this and seems to be having fun as the sleazy leaderof the town. I have plenty of issues with the plot of this movie. Thelead woman Arlen (Suki) has her arm and leg taken but that's not toset-up a revenge story. It's more just something that happened and thenshe wanders around the desert for a bit and eventually returns to town.The overall look of the movie is one of the highlights. Thecinematography is simple but very colourful. But it also ends upbringing out the biggest issue I had with the movie. It just feels likea bunch of pretty scenes that don't fit together as an interestingmovie.
