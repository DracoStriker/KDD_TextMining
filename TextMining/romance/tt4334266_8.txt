I went against my instincts when it came to watching 'The Bad Batch'.Every nerve in my body was telling me it would be dreadful, but thewords cannibals, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves and Giovanni Ribisi keptrepeating over and over in my head until I finally gave in and made thefateful mistake of watching it. My god, how is it possible to make astory this boring out of cannibals? Every single thing it tries to makeitself interesting with completely falls flat. When you manage to get acompletely dull and forgettable performance out of Jim Carrey you knowyou're doing something terribly wrong.The film tries to be thought-provoking (at least it seemed like thatwas what it was going for) but none of the concepts it presents are inany way actually worthy of a second thought. It also goes for a lot ofstyle, however it again falls short. In a futuristic desert wastelandsetting there a thousand different concepts you could use to create aninteresting story. For some reason 'The Bad Batch' chooses a story thatcould have been told in any setting and in any time period. That'sabout as lazy as story-telling gets. If you do make the mistake ofselecting this one up on Netflix brace yourself for a long and painfulcouple of hours.
