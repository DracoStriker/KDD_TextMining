I have no idea what made me watch this movie other than Jason Momoawithout a shirt. It was just bad that just got worse but I keptwatching just to see how far it went. Suki Waterhouse, Jason Momoa,Giovanni Rabisi, Jim Carrey, and Keanu Reeves. How did this happen?They must have lost a football bet or something. Plot points, thedesert, wind, bbq'd human limbs, midnight raves, drugs, preggo stepfordwives, 70's era cult leader, mental illness, bad accents from badactors and a bunny. This movie left me thirsty, needing a shower, somechapstick and detangler. Why did I watch it again?? oh yeah, shirtlessJason. There was that at least.
