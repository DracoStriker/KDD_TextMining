It's like someone explaining their bad trip at burning man for like, 2hours, and somehow they never saw anything interesting. Two hours atthe trash fence, with Jason Momoa walking around looking buff. It seemsto be mostly set in dumps. Spoiler alert - the bunny does not make it.If I did not see it in the theatre I would never have made it to theend. This is called the Sunk Costs Fallacy.
