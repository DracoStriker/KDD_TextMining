Very underrated movie. The picture, story, actors, makeup, details,music etc. everything deserves a lot more than today's rating(5,5).Watch it for yourself. The only obvious drawback is Keanu Reeves whosuck not because he does a bad job, but because he is Keanu Reeves. Hedoes not fit in, all the other character does more or less.
