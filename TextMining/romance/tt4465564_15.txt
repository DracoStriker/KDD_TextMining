Alright the shitty major guilty pleasure franchise based on the shittytwilight fan fiction continues so will it be better or worst than thefirst one or what? Thats what we will know right now ,firstly it wasway way way worst than the 1st one,i wanted to see it at the cinemacause it could be deleted version but in did see it both cinema andleaked version so i said why not specially the director i love hismovies so i had some hopes that they could learn from the mistakes butthey made it worst the acting was way way way worst even Dakota Johnsonshe looks great Jarmie Dornan is right in loving her but she was worstthan the first one although Grey's pleasures or his bad way in treatingher was not harsh as the first one but still his acting was like afalsehood acting even the soundtrack that the first one was perfectat,this one's music was bad only countable songs were good even the sexscenes itself one in the beginnings of the movie wasn't made right butthe rest were realistic again because they edited some music its notNC-17 if it was NC17 movie i would've said its great one but no, i justliked the chemistry between them but porn watchers will say its a goodone but I'm not a porn watcher I'm saying its a guilty pleasure causeits laughably bad it is good and i could enjoy it without making it agood one again another shitty soft core porn feature film my rating isits not horseshit its triple horseshit or horseshit to the power of 10?that's why my score is 1/10
