Monumentally poor script writing gives the actors no chance of draggingthis anywhere. Attempt has been made to give this a thriller feel butit is without any and i mean any subtleties. It is a series of glossyvideos where the soundtrack directs the audience to the plot and howthey should respond. In showing last night audience were laughing outloud at the dialogue frequently and {spoiler} the scene post helicoptercrash there were gasps of disbelief at the rapid turn of events. Cinemawas packed with groups of ladies clearly lapping this nonsense up so iam sure it will make a fortune. Last one to leave please switch out thelights.
