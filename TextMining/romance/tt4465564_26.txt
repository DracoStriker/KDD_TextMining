Got dragged to this crap by a lady friend. I watched this movie andtried to figure out why people loved this franchise. It kind of feltpointless to me. Did we really need another movie after the first one?The first one was horrible.And this one somehow manages to be even worse. And then I find outthere's another one coming? WHAT? WHY? Save yourself the trouble. The movie feels like a better acted (not by much mind you) Skinemaxmovie.It's both stupid and pretentious. Only got see this if your significant other really wants to see it. Andmake sure that you make the deal that if you sit through this crap theyhave to see one of your movies too. I went to see this with my ladyfriend and I made the deal with her that if I saw this with her, shehad to see "Get Out" with me. So I got screwed both ways because Iended up seeing two crap movies in one weekend.
