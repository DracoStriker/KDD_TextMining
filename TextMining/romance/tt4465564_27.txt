I was expecting for much better processed and shocking scenario andacting around a man who has psychological problems and a woman wholoves him. But even I love psychological-based films, I had to forcemyself to keep my interest on film during ~1:45 hours. I'm impressedonly latest section (after heli accident). But the rest of the film arejust boring, boring, boring... Such scenarios are hard, and must bestudied and acted much better.
