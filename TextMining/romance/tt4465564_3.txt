This movie is awful, yes, there's the best way to describe this movie.Acting, terrible, the story does not make sense. The girl that's in thetrailer has no impact in the movie. It's once again just about sex anda bad... really bad written movie.The soundtrack can be said that's decent. Some of the camera work aswell is good. But that resumes all the movie. It's once again a baitfor teenagers girls that want to go watch soft porn in the cinemas onceagain.Sorry to be really straight to the point here, but if you really likedthis movie maybe you have some issues.. or it's me?
