When I seen fifty shades of Grey I thought even though it didn't staytoo true to the book it was a very good movie...then darker came out Iwaited two years since the first movie and to me it was way worth thewait I freaking loved this movie the characters seemed more comfortablewith each other and the acting of Ana was much much better I wasimpressed and Christian put on some weight but not only that the othercharacters to me was more interesting like Mrs Lincoln and Leah was sogood I just wished u seen more of Ana and Jose and Kate and Elliot thatwas the only problem for me but Christian was much more convincing inthe film so intense loved him and the sex scene oh my I just blushedagain...?? I truly enjoyed this film but I do recommend people if yournot into BDSM and you haven't read the books then don not see the film
