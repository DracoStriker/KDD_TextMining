I have reviewed several times the film: there are at least three timesin the book that had to be absolutely highlighted because they are fullof pathos and give meaning to the whole story, but in the film werejust mentioned and made superficially banal, while the second book isthe key to everything.Bad screenplay, trite and gaunt (it seems that the author has read onlya summary of the book ...), bad also cinematography and directing. Theentire film seems a ugly trailer. The music is only a distant echo ofthat of the first film. Christian appears sloppy, inconsistent, lackingin personality. Ana has no personality, but what can you with ascreenplay like this ...It seems that both the director andscreenwriter have never read the books and that the author, someticulous and careful in monitoring implementation of the first film,she went, for the second, on vacation somewhere.A special, not relevant but significant (and is indicative of a totallack of care with which it was carried throughout the film andliquidated in a hurry) is the adopted brother of Christian, Elliot thatin the first film was fun and bright, in FSD chewing gum throughout thefilm: horrible.In Fifty Shades of Gray, Sam Taylor-Johnson had hit the mark andphotography of Seamus McGarvey had made magic every detail. Everythinghad a very refined taste and was totally devoid of vulgarity. Theexcitement of the first film remain only a beautiful memory: I'm reallyvery disappointed.
