I hate the fact i ever watched the first one, my addictive persona doesnot allow me to stop watching a series till its done...its a lost,twilight, fast and the furious hell! Boy is this film stale bread! Clunky and ridiculous. Dakota needs totake a page from Marcia Gays book she can actually cry when requirednot just scrunch her face up like a discarded chocolate bar wrapper.Kim Basinger should have been in it more...you have a diamond like herand show her off for 30secs at the end, tut tut! I was surprised Kim B was in it actually being the star of 9 1/2 weeksand fifty shades being a complete rip off of it, as well as theSecretary of course. There's definitely some other films thrown inthere. I think that's where the author got her inspiration, a girlsnight in with a bottle of red, an ip dip do on chick flicks laced withJames Spader and Mickey Rouke...and maybe a secret Santa joke presentin the form of a vibrator. Jamie Dornan is an Irish dream boat, he's still developing as an actorbut he predominantly carries the film. That's why he has to be soripped, hes just dragging the whole thing behind him..'come on Dakota,pick up your lip its causing drag, Rita...where are you going? Stoprunning around in circles and get back here', "Hi, Ho, Hi Ho" JamieI think this film restricts his potential and its a shame hisinteractions with Marcia and Kim couldn't have been longer, as i thinkwe could have seen the dual personality of this potentially good andcomplex character. But nooo, a big steamy dollop of manure was the final outcome...sorryJamie but not even with your muscles could you drag this dung heap tothe Oscars/baftas!
