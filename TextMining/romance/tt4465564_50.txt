Before I start, " write a spoiler " how can you write a spoiler forrepetitive rubbish ? But just in case..... I did see the first film,which I didn't mind too much, maybe it's me.....another year olderetc., however I did go with 3 other girlfriends, none of whom enjoyedit,interestingly enough there was not a man in sight in thecinema.....they knew better ! The film is mild soft porn, and I foundit detrimental to women that Dakota Johnson continually got undressed,yet Jamie Dornan only stripped down in virtually the last scene, It wasas though ' I am the star of this film, and I will not stoop tohumiliate myself ' ( although I am getting a small fortune to doso.....) Coming to Jamie Dornan, who was excellent in The Fall, is sobad in this, apart from his looks ....he was recently on The GrahamNorton Show, and had a heavy beard and shocking haircut, he came overas a shy and boring guy in real life, although he was being ridiculedby Kiano Reeves.....however no excuse for another wooden performance asthe I thought , charismatic and Bond like Christian Grey. Grey for thisfilm is the operative word - another dire outing to the movies
