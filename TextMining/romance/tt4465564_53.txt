Fifty Shades Darker is the worst thing in the history of all thingsever.It's a cheap corporate product only made to make money and suck up allthe cash they can from middle-aged divorced women who are brain-deadand do not realize that they should be supporting amazing andthoughtful films like Finding Nemo.This movie has so much sexuality that I felt a little bump in the lowerhalf of my body and if a film can give me a tumor simply by existingyou know there's some sort of issue.Avoid this and watch Finding Nemo which is an inspiring film withactual work put into it.
