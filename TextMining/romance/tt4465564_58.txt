If I could give this movie a 1/2 star I would. They only made a numbertwo because they made so much money off of the first one. Which wasjust as bad, if not worse. No wait. THIS was worse (if you can wrapyour head around that). Why would you make a PG-13 movie based off of arated R book? Not to say the books were any better, but at least theywere racy. This soft mediocre porn drivel they dared to put on thesilver screen is just stupid. I want my money AND my 118 minutes back.
