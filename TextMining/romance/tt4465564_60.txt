The sequel to the successful sex romance tells a little more of themind-numbingly boring story of Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) andAnastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). The first film left off with thembreaking up but Grey continues to his relentless pursuit of Anastasiathat is not borderline creepy but way past it. He buys up enlargepictures of her that are being sold at a friend's photography gallerydisplay and continues to send her gifts. Anastasia has started workingat a small publishing company under her jealous boss Jack Hyde (EricJohnson). Anastasia agrees to have dinner with Christian and they reignite theirpassionate romance though she still has reservations despite hisinsistence to give her money. Christian is still in touch with his oldlover and the one who taught him about BDSM, Elena Lincoln (KimBasinger). Anastasia is also being stalked by one of Grey's oldsubmissives Kate Kavanaugh (Eloise Mumford). These strange occurrencesnever amount to much and the drama is alway overshadowed by the need toshow another sex scene.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
