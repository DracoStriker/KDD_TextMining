As moviegoers say,"Sex sells!!!" Despite the poor screenplay and lack of chemistry between theleads,Fifty Shades Of Grey earned more than half a billion dollarsworld-wide.The producers knowing that this is a great money earner haveplaced their faith on the two sequels they plan to make such as FiftyShades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.Now it is 2017 and Fifty Shades Darker starring Dakota Johnson andJamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey respectively hasbeen released in the theater together with Eric Johnson, EloiseMumford, Bella Heathcote, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, KimBasinger and Marcia Gay Harden.Director James Foley and screenwriterNiall Leonard provides another movie featuring the reunion ofAnastasia,who just finished college degree and started working atSeattle Publishing House, and Christian Grey,who was taught byAnastasia with new values during their reunion. This led to both havingsex as often as possible despite the fact that they don't go throughBDSM to translate kinkiness on the big screen.Too bad that the sexscenes that they go through does not really produce anythinginteresting to the viewers.Just like the first film,the viewer would still notice that DakotaJohnson and Jamie Dornan still exhibit lack of chemistry with oneanother and they remain uncomfortable with their sex scenes they gothrough despite the fact that there is no BDSM involved.Added tothat,the relationship between them would not look anything except likea one-night stand as both Dakota and Jamie lack good performance intheir portrayal most especially when both are together having sex inbed. But in spite of the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph,themovie have currently earned almost $300 million. Expect the film toearn more for as they say,"Sex sells" all the time.Wanting to watch thelead characters in a lot of kinkiness would definitely lead manyviewers into the theaters and buying the movie's DVD upon itsrelease.That is in spite of the lack of realism and not-so-good storyin involved in it.
