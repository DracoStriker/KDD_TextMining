There was so much emotion in the books that the actors and actressesjust could not bring to the screen. It was as if the directors andproducers had never read the books. So let me correct some things thatthe movie missed or messed up. After their break-up Ana was devastatedand was not eating properly. Christian had purchased SIP before Ana haddrinks with her co -workers. Kate's brother comes to town for a visitso Ana gives him her key. When Ana gets home she is buzzed in only towalk in the door to Lelia holding the gun. Ana hits a bar across thestreet with Kate's brother. My favorite scene in book 2 was whereChristian panics thinking Ana is going to leave him again he falls tohis knees. Ana not understanding asks what is he doing a few timesbefore telling him to look at her and he does. The movie really reallymissed the emotion in these scenes. The news covers the story of themissing helicopter but does not announce Christian was alive. Ana wasdisgusted that Elena started a sexual relationship with Christian whenhe was so young. Dr. Grey slaps Elena before telling her to get out ofher house. Elena was not bold enough to deliberately drop a towel inrebellion before walking off in the book.I hope everyone involved inthe 3rd movie reads the book at least twice before filming.
