Not that my expectations were too high, but come on :-) this is worsethan the worst soap opera: too bad acting, the screenplay is awful,accent placed heavily on luxury and materialism; relationships at zerolevel; dialogue - none; story - extremely dull or even nothing there...shame for all the money invested in this production and for itsadvertising! As focus was placed on the sex scenes: wronginterpretation of good vs rude sexual interaction!!! Lack ofimagination and link between scenes sexual or non-sexual ones! Dullepisodes that have no place in the middle of the screenplay...etc. Ican go on like this and one night will not be enough to list all thebad sides of this movie. Sorry, but on the background of all thisnegativity I would not mention a single positive aspect of it for itwould not make any difference in the general view.
