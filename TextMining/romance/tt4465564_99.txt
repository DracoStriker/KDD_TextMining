I have read all three books, and out of them all,this one had a moregripping story line outside of the sex which becomes tiresome quickly.When these actors were cast I was disappointed, as not what I hoped orimagined. I watched the first and thought, OK, can live with it,although Jamie is not cold enough, and Dakota seems awkward. I waslooking forward to the Lelia aspect in this movie as well as the Jackcreepy boss issue. I thought throughout the movie it was all rushed,only briefly encountered these story lines and I felt let down. Ithought Dakota didn't show enough emotion, Elena is not right played byKim , should have been more striking. In all, the books are weakanyway, but I thought this was the best of the three but the moviedidn't do it justice.
