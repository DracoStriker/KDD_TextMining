Because both of the stories told are lame.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is a writer who sends his ex his latestbook as a form of revenge by being successful by writing her as acharacter that dies in the book.This book could not be a bestseller in real life cause the writing islazy and to obvious for it's own good. If there is a plot in heresomewhere I really missed it. Besides the stories matched really badand it became confusing that you started to wonder if it wereflashbacks from the story or from "actual life".A lot of scenes dragged and scenes that could have made an impact arevery numbed down and to much attention on boring art that had little tonothing to do with the movie. Dialogue felt really awkward sometimesand even messed up the characters even more because it made 'm comeacross like a bunch of snobs.Also the same dialogue was repetitive and some exposition was firstdiscussed and later on almost the same thing is discussed again. Themovie is not that difficult that you have to explain yourself 2 to 3times.I mean what"s the point and why would a director treat his audiencethis way. I almost would think that the arrogance of this director isthe reason critics rate this so highly while I view this more as formover substance thing, which is fine if your talking to an art housecrowd but not for the average moviegoer.Now I watched this to the end waiting for the plot that never came andAmy Adams getting stood up in a restaurant probably also waiting forthe plot that never came and that sums up to a plot less movie.There are people that like these kind of movies where style is more afactor than story if you don't mind that to much you might like this.Combined with a good story I'm all for style but sadly that wasn't thecase here.All there is left to say is...don't feed the (nocturnal) animals.Thank you.
