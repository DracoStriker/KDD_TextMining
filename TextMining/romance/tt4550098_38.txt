Exactly like his first film, this promises to deliver something whichit is ultimately incapable of doing, instead being predictable andbereft of any depth. The story within a story is the thing that savesthe film from being utter claptrap, and Jake Gyllenhaal and MichaelShannon also help prevent it from becoming total BS, but only just. The"real world" scenes are filled with the kind of pretentious arseholeswhich most of us thankfully never have to associate with, yet without ajot of irony or humour. In fact, every second of this film is aspo-faced as it gets, and the ultra-serious tone makes us thinksomething big is coming; something profound. Instead, it just ends, andit feels like he's attempting to do a Haneke trick, like we're supposedto have some realisation in the absence of denouement. But no, it'sjust meaningless ballsacks.
