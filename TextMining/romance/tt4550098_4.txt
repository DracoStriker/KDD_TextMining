Easily the best film I have seen this year. Great performance by allthe actors, fantastic plot with a lot of deep meaning and a veryatmospheric soundtrack. It's a very unique film. It reminds me of BasicInstinct but without the sex and drugs. It looks like a 90s masterpiecebrought from back in time, a solid prove that Tom Ford is a greatdirector.True love comes once in a lifetime, and we rarely get a second chance.This film is about revenge and personal progress in life, Its about howthe decisions of the past can haunt our lives in the future and how thepain we cause to others always comes back to us. This movie sends astrong message to the people who easily give up on other people andnever give them a fair chance to shine.I can't understand why some people rated this movie 1/10, just theperformance of the actors and the soundtrack of the film should beenough to give it a solid 5.
