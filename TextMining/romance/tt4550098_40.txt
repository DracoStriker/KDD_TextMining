First of all, I am SHOCKED with the negative reviews this movie hasgot, but I "some what" can understand, these people didn't "get" themovie, this movie is a piece of art, literally I have never seenanything this well told before. The point of this movie is way beyondthe cinematic play or the script itself, it's much deeper than this,it's one of those movies that need to come with a catalog to explain topeople what happened there, luckily enough I can relate to thecharacter so I understood what the movie is trying to tell me. Thismovie is NOT a thriller or an action movie, it's not a "police" oneeither, it's a movie about a broken heart, that took 19 years to try tofix itself and eventually it did, and the ones that broke that hearteventually got to pay for it....... It's so deep and touching like noother, a must watch if you have been hurt in love.
