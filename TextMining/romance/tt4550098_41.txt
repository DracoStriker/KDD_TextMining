Tom Ford clearly has grown as an artistE. He used OTHER designer retro-framed glasses in his movie. WOW! Within first 15 minutes movie lookslike pretty models reading que cards. The more pretty models come inwith irrelevant stilted dialogue. Tom Ford apparently thinks thatpeople talk as if giving Google cliff- notes to each other: "I wasmarried once , he is my ex-husband he wrote a novel I left him , I amhorrible person" this is pretty much first dialogue in the movie. Ifyou can call it dialogue, then it goes down from there. I feltuncomfortable at times the movie was so bad, watches as some TV dramamade on a shoestring budget. His first film was nothing special, but atleast it was a film. This exercise is just so much worse I think heshould concentrate on imitating YSL and leave the cinema to artists.
