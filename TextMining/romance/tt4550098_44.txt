A series of unfortunate events indeed. The movie starts out strong withcryptic depictions of overly sized women. It tries to catch you fromthe start with its terrific cinematography. But the fact that it isdirected by renowned fashion designer Tom Ford doesn't make it anybetter. After this movie it is seemed that Tom Ford is better off todesigning lady underpants as the movie continues its constant drag ofsomber and never really picks up. This is such a shame as there arehuge potential for a movie of this size and thou the acting is terrificwith Michael Shannon, Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams leading the way, themovie falls short of producing a hit and i soon find myself dozing offin the cinema. Very disappointing film. More artsy than a film ofsubstance. Very convoluted too with it's seemingly 3 parts plot lineinto one. Worse of all, the ending is simply the worse, a sharp cut toblack with no closure or explanation to the film. Not cool
