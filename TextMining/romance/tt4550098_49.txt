I mostly enjoyed this movie. It was hard to follow at times, switchingback and forth between the story lines. Stylistically the movie isimpeccable. The art, the costumes were dazzlingly. The herky jerkynature of the storytelling was the downfall for me. That and theending. Is it too much to ask for a definitive ending? After two hoursof watching the director's vision - I want an ending!
