Not sure why this is getting such slavishly, raving, reviews (althoughI suspect it's because of the 'luvvie' aspect thanks to the director).It was painful, tiresome and somewhat hideous to sit through. It feltlike a very poor nod to David Lynch, and the theme of despair and lackof redemption didn't add to it's lack of charm.I read a review on the Odeon site which summed it up for me, so myreview will loosely echo a guy on that site. The film starts how itmeans to go on - it assaults your senses in a really unpleasant way.There is nothing new or clever about this film; it's an exercise inbleakness, despair and much hand-wringing and naval-gazing by the mainprotagonist, Susan. Lest there is any doubt in the mind of the viewerabout the theme towards the end, an art piece that spells 'revenge' isgiven a bit of air time and another angsty scene is written around it.It's nothing but an empty, dark little exercise in despair, thinkingitself more clever than it actually is. I nearly walked out in thefirst ten minutes from the opening scene alone. I wish I had.
