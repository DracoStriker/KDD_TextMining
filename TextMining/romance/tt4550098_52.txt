I wasted my time and money watching this bad movie. Plot isunbelievable and acting was plain silly. Don't waste your money on thispoorly produced movie. If you want to entertained, there are lots ofalternatives. I always wonder why people would subject themselves tosuch poorly made show when there are so many other quality movie. Iguess it appeals to the low intelligence and naive audiences.Personally, I would watch a old rerun of a TV flick than this movie.Here is my detailed evaluation of the movie (out of 10 points where 1is lowest and 10 is highest): Plot: 3 Acting: 4 Directing: 2Excitement: 3 Special effects: 2 Overall quality: 3 Overall summary:disappointing
