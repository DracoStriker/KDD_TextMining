The reason I put a spoiler alert is because I wanted to notify anybodywho is considering watching this movie that it contains multiple vulgarscenes including sexual assault and nudity. The remainder of my reviewcontains no spoilers whatsoever. My first and general thought whilewatching this movie was that it is very "well-made". The story-line,the filming style, the soundtrack, and the acting were all a solid10/10. The only reason I gave it an overall 8 was because of the looseends. It was one of those movies where the screen faded to black beforeyou expected it to. Other than that, it is well worth the watch. JakeGyllenhaal's acting alone will make you want to keep watching. Ifyou're on the fence about whether or not to watch this movie, don'tlisten to those who gave it a 1/10, and ignore those who make it soundlike it's the best movie of all-time. Just watch it and decide foryourself.
