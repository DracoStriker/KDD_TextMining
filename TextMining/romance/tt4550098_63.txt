This film is pretentious. But if you call it out for what it is, youare accused of "not understanding" it. I call B.S."Ohh.. look at me... I'm so artsy... there are parallels and metaphorshere.. you see, this symbolizes despair, and this other thing.. itsymbolizes freedom.. if you give me a bad review, it just means thatyou're too stupid to understand what I was saying."No. I understand perfectly well what you were saying. There's just nosubstance to your story. I would expect better from a sophomore filmclass.The purpose of a film is to tell a story.. to entertain people. Not toquiz them on their ability to pick up on metaphors. The only useful thing that this film does is give idiots a springboardto say "Oh! I figured it out! I'm so smart!"
