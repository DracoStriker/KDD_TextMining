i just finished watching nocturnal animals, it is great it iswonderful. the soundtrack is great and i liked the idea of a storyinside a story. jack Gyllenhaal as usual was great, his facialexpressions and i felt his tragedy although he didn't say much and AmyAdams too. i felt her inner pain.. the way she was at her gallery afterthe show ended, when she called her husband and knew he was cheating,when she called her daughter. u can see sadness in her eyes. the totaltheme of Nocturnal Animals is sad, and it deeply touches you. Susan (Amy Adams) left her ex husband because she thought he can't be in herfuture. he misunderstood that it was because his weakness which alsoappeared at the final scene when Ray called him weak !! that's why heshooted him..other than that, he wouldn't. he sent her that book totell her i am not weak, i am not an awful writer, i wrote a story aboutmyself again and you'll feel my pain and sadness all over you life ..and you'll be regretting and will be alone which i think the last scenein the restaurant revealed it . allover, it is a great experience, theacting the plot the general atmosphere of the movie, the moral of it,the stylish theme of tom ford as we know. if you wanna lose yourself ina dramatic deep touchy journey. go for NOCTURNAL ANIMALS.
