In any case, we can say that it caused an amazing discussion among usat the end of the movie! We were three, two guys and one girl, whowatched Nocturnal Animals, and when appeared the words "the end", wehad three different versions of what could be the explanation to begiven to this strange business! Admittedly, it's true that severalpieces were not understood by us during the movie, or at least had notcaught all our attention when it had appeared. In spite of the prettypoor rate I gave to this movie, it will be necessary for me to Watch itagain, one of these days to miss nothing this time - As it is in TheSixth Sense. A movie to be seen, but you must beware brainoverheating!-) J-L K
