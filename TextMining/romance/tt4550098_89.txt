Hyper privileged 40-something Susan has an enviable job, a huge villaon the hills, an unfaithful - albeit polite and charming - husband andand ex-husband, who out of the blue sends her the manuscript of hisbook.Ex-hubby Edward resentfully avoided contact with Susan for 19 years butsuddenly he decides he wants her opinion about his book. This seemsfishy, but Susan is delighted - maybe because her marriage is on therocks and she feels nostalgic about Edward...Major problem here: how did Edward know about Susan's situation? Theywere not in contact for 19 years after a brutal break-up but somehow heguessed that Susan's life has reached luxurious rock-bottom: failedmarriage, dissatisfaction with the job, boredom all round, despite thelavish lifestyle.Anyway, the "movie within the movie" starts with Susan reading thenovel, a violent story more interesting than the "real" one.The novel should be interpreted as Edward's revenge. He wants to upsetSusan by metaphorically eliminating her in a brutal way. However,Edward comes out as mean and weak for carrying a grudge for all thoseyears. Susan gets plenty of time to regret her decisions, but shecannot change the past.As to be expected the photography, costumes and sets are chillingbeautiful - "chilling"being the key word. The brutal "fictional" storyis gripping, although silly in parts, the "conversation before killingsomeone" cliché being the silliest, but the point of the whole movieseems to be that rich people can also be unhappy.That may be so, but as it was stated many times, it is better to cry ina Roll Royce coming back from the most expensive restaurant in town,rather than in a cardboard box under a bridge.
