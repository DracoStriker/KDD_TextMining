I have never written a movie review before. I also had never heard ofTom Ford or Austin Wright. With that said I went into this movietotally unbiased and based on recommendation by co workers.After seeing the movie I decided to check out IMDb and see the quotes,goofs, trivia and whether it was a screen play or based on a book. Fromwhat I have found out about the book, the movie works closely with theoverall theme of it.This time I also chose to read reviews about the movie. And there issuch a wide range of opinion from no stars to ten stars with lots ofboth positive and negative reviews. For those who rated it negatively,based on their comments, I would think that they might not haveunderstood the plot nor the subplot of the movie. You have to look deepwithin the movie and understand the plot and purpose of the film. No, it's not the best movie I have ever seen but based on Hollywood'soverexposure of super heroes, science fiction and unrealistic fantasyplots they produce, this was a good, solid thriller that although mightnot have left me sitting on the edge of my seat, it did open my mind tosee the subplots intended. I won't say much else because I could spoilit, but think closely about the characters and what they representedand think closely about the underlying messages within the story andenjoy the movie.This movie is an intellectual thriller and you must have a littlehigher intellect to really understand it.
