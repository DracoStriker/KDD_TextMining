A wealthy art gallery owner is haunted by her ex-husband's novel, aviolent thriller she interprets as a symbolic revenge tale. NocturnalAnimals is not your typical kind of drama or thriller it's actually waydarker and has a lot of mystery around it plus the leading performancesby Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnsonwere fantastic and very good written and it surprised me because thefilm is actually directed by a guy who knows only how to design clothesbut right now he also knows how to direct good and well written moviesbut that doesn't mean that the movie is perfect it actually goes backand fourth from the book that Susan reads to her flashbacks with Edwardto her new life as a wealthy art gallery owner and that is kindaconfusing at times plus the movie needed a bit more of chase or just abit more of suspense but other than that it was a pretty good film andpeople will definitely enjoy it. (7/10)
