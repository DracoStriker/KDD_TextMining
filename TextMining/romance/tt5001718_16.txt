I get why the youngest of targeted audience would enjoy this movie, butanyone over the age of 16 should know better. This movie is simply justthe plot of Bubble Boy crossed with the nauseating sappiness of TheFault In Our Stars. Predictable from the very start, I only finished itin hopes that it wouldn't end exactly house I knew it would. The onlything that earns any stars at all is the casting; the chemistry betweenthe two main actors was sweetly charming, even through the terribleclichés common in teen romances.
