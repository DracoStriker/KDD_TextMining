*MAJOR PLOT RUINING SPOILERS*I liked the story as much as I enjoy any other sappy teenage romance.There are unforgivable "movie sins" in this movie that I can not getover though and that is the way that child abuse is handled. The mainhuge plot twist of this movie is that Maddy's mother was a delusionalchild abuser who kept her daughter locked in a glass cage with thethreat of dying from a disease that she didn't have. The way in whichthe movie handles this is having Maddy run away to nurse Carla, herprevious caretaker and only other human contact who got fired forallowing her to stand in the same room as another human being. Thisfirst step was amazing but from then on it just went down hill. Maddydoes not press charges and her mother is treated like she is also avictim who should be offered sympathy. This is neither a realistic andhuman response to that kind of situation nor is it morally right. Themovie ends with a mentally unstable individual who imprisoned someonefor their entire life walking free with no consequences. If the womanis capable of that kind of craziness than what horrors will she inflictupon the world now after her victim has escaped.
