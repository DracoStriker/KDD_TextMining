This type of movie is dime a dozen. It has a twist toward the end thatI did not expect, but it really did not have much of am impact on me.It was hard to fully watch this movie and the scenes where the boy andgirl are "texting", but talking in person are just strange. I cannotsay I would not recommend this movie, but of it's type, there are manyMUCH better movies. Titanic and Notebook come to mind right off hand.My true thought of this movie is it is a Mellennial version of a lovestory.
