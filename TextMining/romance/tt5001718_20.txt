I saw the trailers and they made me want to see the movie but thatstrong emotion that the trailers seemed to have was really lacking inthe movie. It was OK, and just that, just OK, Maybe my expectationswere too high because I thought this had the potential to be a reallyemotional movie, a tear jerker. Nope not one tear was shed. Honestly Ican't put my finger on what was wrong. Everything was adequate butnothing stood out.The only emotional response I had at all was anger at the twist. Hadn'tread the book and wasn't expecting that. At first I was mad at the mombut then my anger was at the writers when I realized the twist was justa way to tie things up for the happy ever after.As said, it was OK, not sorry I watched it but I doubt seriously I'llever watch it again.
