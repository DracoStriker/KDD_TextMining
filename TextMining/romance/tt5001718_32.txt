I will say when it comes to the genre of young adult love stories, theytend to be rather predictable with the boy and girl meeting and fallingin love. The tradition continues but offers a somewhat different takein which the girl maddie is diagnosed with a immune disease thatprevents her from going outside and lives Ina sterilized environment,the boy Ollie is the emo kid dressed in black who deals with an abusivefather, the two meet and instantly fall in love.
