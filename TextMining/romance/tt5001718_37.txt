'EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING': Three Stars (Out of Five)A youth romantic drama, based on the 2015 young-adult novel (of thesame name) by Nicola Yoon. It tells the story of an 18-year-old girlwith SCID (an immune-deficiency disease that confines her to her home)who falls for a young man (the same age) that moves into the house nextdoor to her. The movie stars Amandla Stenbergand (Rue from 'THE HUNGERGAMES') and Nick Robinson. It was a modest hit at the Box Office, butit's also only gotten mixed (mediocre) reviews from critics. I found itto be pretty much exactly what I expected it to be, from a Hollywoodfilm based on a popular YA novel. Maddy (Stenbergand) is 18-years-old, and she's been the victim of animmune-deficiency disease all of her life (called SCID). The diseaseprevents Maddy from ever leaving her house, and interacting with otherpeople. Her mother, Pauline (Anika Noni Rose), keeps her confined totheir house, where she takes care of Maddy with the help of a nursenamed Carla (Ana de la Reguera). These are the only people Maddy knows(in addition to Carla's daughter). Then a young man named Olly(Robinson) moves in next door, and Maddy's world is forever changed.Which is strongly against Pauline's wishes. The movie is pretty standard teen drama material, and it's notsurprising (at all to me) that it was adapted from a popular youngadult novel. It's well made and acted, to a certain extent, and I thinkStenbergand could be a talented actress to watch for (her role hereisn't that demanding though). I wouldn't say the film is bad or good,and I think it should definitely please it's target audience. I alsowasn't bored or uninvolved in it, I think the filmmakers accomplishedwhat they set out to do.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://youtu.be/SXjABrLbV7A
