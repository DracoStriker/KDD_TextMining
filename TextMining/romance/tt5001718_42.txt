I have been waiting to watch this movie for a very long time. I likemovies with diverse casting. This drew me in especially because of theinterracial relationships (Maddy and Olly and (although not mentioned)Maddy's mom and dad) in this movie. I love the fact that despite itbeing centered about this biracial girl and a Caucasian boy, it wasn'tthe selling point of this movie. It wasn't mentioned once nor made abig deal of. The actors had amazing chemistry and it was pleasant to watch. Goodacting. However, I would have loved to see the struggles Olly wentthrough with his father and his side of the story. I understand that inthe book, this was not the case. In short, this movie will make your heart skip beats and occasionallypause (if you can) to absorb things and later wonder why they didn'texplain certain things. It is light and something you can watch and nothurt your brain from thinking. All in all, a very nice movie. Go watchit :)
