This film tells the story of a teenage girl who has a serious illnesscalled SCID, which affects her immune system and makes her prone todeadly infections. She is not allowed out of her house by her mother,until one day she decides to break free from her beautiful cocoon."Everything, Everything" captivates me right from the start because thehouse it is set in is beautiful. The decor is minimalist and modern,which s exactly my taste. Then, the story is engaging because I cannotimagine what life is like to be captive inside the house, having toconstantly worry about catching a nasty bug. The girl is very sweet andlikable, and I feel so sorry for her illness. She is very brave to riskher life and break out of her house, as she wants to really live herlife. The ending twist is very unexpected, as I have not imagined thatthe story is going to turn out like this. This twist adds anotherdimension to the story, and enhances the film.
