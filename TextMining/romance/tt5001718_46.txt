There is a cottage industry of teen romance films where a character isdying (see: A Walk to Remember, A Fault in their Stars etc).Everything, Everything neatly fits in that category. It's about a younggirl, recently turned 18 Maddy Whittier. She's completely housebound asshe has a rare disorder that means her immune system is extremely weakand almost everything in the outside world could potentially kill her.Her mother tries to make sure she's well socialized by enrolling her inonline classes and support groups but basically the only human contactshe has is with her nurse and her nurse's daughter who is roughly thesame age as Maddy. Shortly after her birthday a new neighbour, Olly, moves in. They begina flirtation through their bedroom windows and through the magic oftechnology and texting they are able to build up a friendship beforemeeting in person for real. But being around Olly makes Maddy cravemore of the outside world and it isn't long before she's willing torisk her everything to see everything else in the world. The film has come under controversy for a last minute convenient twistwhich I won't spoil here, but my big problem with the movie is that itfeels as antiseptic and as passionless as Maddy's pristine home. Maddymust be sensory deprived from years of barely seeing anyone but that'sbarely touched, Olly comes from an abusive family but that's barelytalked about as well. The third act twist had a lot of potential butbarely goes anywhere. Everything in the movie is just neat andconvenient as if we're just marking off plot points until theinevitable happy ending. The other actors do what they can but they'renot given much to chew on either. A decent enough movie but if you're looking for any kind of depth youshould go somewhere else.
