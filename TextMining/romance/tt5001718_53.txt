At first, I thought the plot was a bit awkward, but as I watched themovie I often found myself smiling and then I realized that itportraits exactly what love means, love doesn't focus on the amount oftime being together, but on the beauty of those moments. Also, there isanother meaning of love in the movie, but I won't make spoilers. Gowatch it!
