Adults, don't be put off by the fact that this movie is being marketedto teens. If you are starved for a good romance, this sweet teen movieis just the ticket. My wife and I went into the movie with zeroexpectations. We only decided to go because we had already seen all theother movies worth seeing. But we ended up being very pleasantlysurprised by this high quality production. The two lead actors havetons of charisma, particularly Amandla Stenberg. She is mesmerizing inevery scene. I can't remember a single scene that was boring or didn'twork. Of course this had as much to do with the good script as theacting. And it certainly didn't hurt that the movie had brightappealing cinematography and songs I'm going to try to find on iTunes.In case you were wondering, "Everything, Everything" has none of thebad language, back talking, and wild parties that are so typical inteen movies these days. And there is only an inconsequential amount ofdrinking. The following would ordinarily be a spoiler. But if you are an adult, Ithink you may enjoy the movie better knowing this. The girl's actionsin the last act seem unreasonable at first. But they make more senseonce you realize that she has decided that living a shortened life toits fullest is preferable to living your whole life in confinement.
