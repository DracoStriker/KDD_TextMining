In a world dominated by stupid sequels, prequels and remakes it isfilm/anime like this that restores hope in today's entertainment.Not only it is emotional and feels real, it delivers a relevantmessage. I love the imagination and palette but also appreciate that itaims to remind us of social issues that we should be paying attentionto.The only reason I don't give our heroes and their story a 10/10 is thatI still feel a couple of Miyazaki movies (like Kiki, Chihiro and theracoon dogs) were just that much better and showed a little moreimagination.Whatever the case I live in fear of the Hollywood announced remake byHollywood hack JJ Abrams who has never shown any talent or vision. Aswith others I will ignore and boycott that coming insult and alwayscherish kimi no na wa.
