I have rated more than 1000 movie on IMDb. So, when I write that thisis the best movie I have ever seen and the only movie that I wrote areview about, I mean it. I always had a deep fear that I will nevermeet my other half, and this movie perfect capture that feeling. Thereis a pain when you wake from a perfect dream and you realize that youwill forget about this perfect world, that was your whole world forthat few moments. I am afraid that I will cross the one without evensaying hi to her. I will say this is a must watch movie for everyone.Good graphics, excellent story, and you are genuinely happy at the endof the movie.
