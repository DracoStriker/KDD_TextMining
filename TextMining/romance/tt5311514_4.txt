So the movie is named "Your name?" and its a perfect title, it doesn'treveal anything about the content and yet it caught my interest. I tendto watch animated movies because they have so much more to offer at thesame time it is a tougher competition.The story line is really good, why? Well it you are open minded it willbe pretty easy to follow and accept what is going on, question abouthow and why get answered by themselves if you believe it is possible.Regarding the animation it give you what your mainstream point of viewof Japans architecture, nature, culture and society, all from how theydress to the body language etc. The music, sound effects and voiceactor/actress amplifies the emotions and guides you from start tillend. There are plenty of a messages and it makes me thing about me andeverything living around me, where I come from and where I am going.Regarding the character development its spot on, no more informationwas needed then what was provided, we are limited but at the same timefree to make our own thought.I wish to say thank you to everyone who have supported and/or workedwith this piece of art, they should feel really proud of themselves, itis an honor that you shared it with us (the viewers). Thank you!
