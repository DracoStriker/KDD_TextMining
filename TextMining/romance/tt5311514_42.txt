Greetings from Lithuania."Your Name" (2016) surprised me more then i thought it will do. It hasa lot of going on here, with some school student problems at thebeginning, body swapping story later and then some more - i won't spoilit. The story here was great, if a bit maybe to complex down the road.Music was beautiful as well as voice acting and animation. Script wasvery involving. "Your Name" is also a very beautiful love story.Overall, the only reason i'm not voting it higher is because i was abit lost near the end. While the story is great and not one dimensionalone, it was a bit to complex for my taste. Yet second viewing would berequired. All in all "Your Name" (and what a beautiful title) is surelynot to be missed one by anyone who loves great stories beautiful told.
