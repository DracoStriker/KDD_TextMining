"Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up."Wow, that was actually really good. Even when watching it at 1am in themorning at my Japanese friend's place, it was really exceptional. Ihadn't watched anime in a long while, so when she suggested turningthis movie on (which I had heard of in advertisements before this cuzof it's endless popularity), I happily accepted, despite the earlyhours of the morning. When I watched it, I realised that despite having loved anime in thepast, I'd never actually watched an anime movie before. But ultimately,it really wasn't too different in style from TV shows. They managed tocapture all the traditional anime elements (school life, dates,part-time jobs, festivals, etc.), yet put an original spin on all ofit. And, like most anime, it has a completely weird premise and darkplot twists. Funny thing with anime is that I can never really tell howit'll end, cuz so many anime in the past have had the craziest kind ofendings. I can never really be sure. I'll always be in doubt until thevery last scene.The Japanese-style scenery and animation was spot-on. The soundtrackwas really good (as is always with anime). Look, pretty much, thismovie's great all round - just give it a watch.Actually, I almost forgot to mention that it's also good on theemotional side of things, so much so that I glimpsed tears in myfriend's eyes towards the ending...Pretty much infinite praise for this anime. It really was so good. Lolalso, just sort of realised that I miss my anime-watching days sobadly.
