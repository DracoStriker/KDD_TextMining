The story being with a girl and a boy. One in the countryside and theother in the city. both are connected through their dreams and they areexchanging bodies and of course a bond is made. Then the story changesits path and you cannot feel but drawn into it without second thoughts.Not only the story is brilliant and really, really, emotional, but thecharacters are really simple, ones that you can feel yourselfidentified with no matter how old you are. Then there is the music,which is the cause of your almost dehydration but remember, once in awhile is good to clean your eyes. Nothing to say about the animation,as this is an anime, and as an anime is simply perfect. It is good tosee some brilliant anime movie that is not from master Miyazaki,because personally, is the best movie from 2016 that I have watched sofar. You have romance, you have drama, you have laughs, you havefantasy, you have science fiction? the perfect combination alltogether, which is easy to say but not so easy to make."Your Name" is a movie that spell-bounds you since the first minute, orsecond. It starts like other movies that have played with theconnection between two people via dreams, but in this case more thandreams it looks like they are exchanging bodies. Yes, it's not thefirst time that this concept is approached but still at the beginningof the movie there is something different, a change in the story thatyou don't see coming because it is too early in the movie for"that" tohappen! And from that moment on you cannot wait to see what is going tohappen and before you realize it the movie is over (almost 2 hours ofyour time well spent!).
