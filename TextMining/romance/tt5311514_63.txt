A visually breathtaking and emotionally resilient slice of life with atwist of fantasy, complex characterization, and a mesmeric soundtrack.Incredibly engaging, it drove me to tears. It's up there with SpiritedAway and Princess Mononoke as one of the greatest anime films, at leastin my opinion. It's beyond me how the Oscars overlooked thismasterpiece.
