Its not what i expected from the anime...thought that it would be aBASIC love story of a boy and a girl BUT the thing that made meappreciate this movie is that it links the Past and Present. Thecomedic factor brings all this together. When both the charactersforgot about each other after saving the city it broke my heart thatthey wont meet each other again as i knew that they were meant for eachother. But Love brought them together and the spark was still there..... truly blessed that i saw this wonderful piece of art. Recommendthis to watch at lest once .
