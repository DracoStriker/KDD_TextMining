I am not a huge anime fan. But this movie is one for everyone, it is amust see. The visuals are phenomenal, music is catchy and the story isheartbreaking. The story is about a boy who switches his body with agirl he does not know, but not for always only in some periods. Thereare so much funny situations, but all in one its sad and depressing. Iwould suggest the movie to all anime enthusiasts and who love thevisuals.
