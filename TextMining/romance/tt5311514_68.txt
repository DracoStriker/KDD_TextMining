Your Name was a very intriguing experience. The film was based around acomet that destroyed a town near Japan's Hida Region, which is verymountainous. Our main character, Mitshua, is a teenage girl who is alsothe mayor's daughter removed from his custody. Meanwhile, our othermain character, Taki, is a teenage boy living in Tokyo who works part-time at a Italian restaurant. However, a comet named Tiamat isapproaching Earth and will happen during one of Mitshua's Family'sfestivals.Your Name was released in Japan last August 2016 and reaching Americanshores in April 2017. In both countries, the film was universallyacclaimed by critics for its splendid animation, story and music. Myopinion on the film is that is almost a Ghibli anime. It has the music,feel and animation of Ghibli. But anyway, you should see this film whenit comes out on Blu-Ray or DVD.
