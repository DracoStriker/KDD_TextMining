75/100 Your Name will keep you on your toes and holding your breath formost of its runtime. The story is an incredible sci-fi with a lot ofheart. One will get confused and desperate to figure out things aroundan hour in, and will root for someone's survival so much near the end!I do think however that the story didn't really write BOTH characterswell that a romance and a romantic ending was justified. Mitsuha wasclearly attracted to someone else for most of that film.
