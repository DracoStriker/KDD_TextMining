'Your Name' is not just one of the best animes in recent years (andthere have been some very good ones), but one of the best animes everfrom personal opinion.Will go even further, saying it's one of the best animated films inrecent years, one of the best animated or otherwise films of the yearand that it rivals the masterworks of Miyazaki. This is a hugecompliment, for any anime, animated film or even any film, and a boldclaim that still stands. Much of it is to do with how 'Your Name's'stayed with me and the impact it's had, a film once seen but neverforgotten.The animation in 'Your Name' is stunning, so beautifully andintricately drawn with immaculate attention to detail in thebackgrounds and a simply breath-taking array of ethereal but alsoatmospheric colours. The music fits the film's atmosphere with noproblem at all and also works wonders as a soundtrack on its own,serving superbly as music on its own.Meanwhile, the script is thought-provoking and touching, with much tosay and explored expertly and neatly with no heavy-handedness. Thestorytelling engages throughout, sucks one into its world and neverlets go of the immersing and is enormously heartfelt, really investingin the characters' chemistry and their love for each other. Pacing isdeliberate, but never drags due to the emotional impact and how wellrealised the characters are, even when noticeably slower in the secondhalf.Characters, and the film's themes, are brilliantly written anddeveloped, and the voice acting is emotive and fit the characters withno qualms.In summary, a truly magnificent film all round that will be rememberedfor years to come. Deserves all the raves it's gotten, and deserving ofeven more. 10/10 Bethany Cox
