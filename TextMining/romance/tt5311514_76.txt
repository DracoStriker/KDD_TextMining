Is the cinema a vehicle for beautiful images independent of thenarrative purpose of the film? Your Name is one of the most stunninglyanimated features I have ever seen, but the level of emotionalresonance is somewhat far south of my favorite Studio Ghibli Filmswhich this film purports to surpass (or equal.) What is the ultimatepoint of this movie? The body swapping story is obviously old-hat, butI felt it would lead to something grand, eventually. But (spoilers-don't read reviews when you don't want spoilers!) when the comet anglesurfaced, I thought that things might finally get interesting. Butinstead, the film built up to a climax with basically a Get out of JailFree Card idea. (I note that Taki summarily rejects a sexpot who is agreat person from all evidence, and makes him look like an asshole inthe process.) I recall that Isao Takahata's Only Yesterday was supposedto be a merely "good" animation from Studio Ghibli. Disney wouldn'teven release it due to a frank discussion about female periods. Butthat film made me cry, and several times on a repeat viewing. Now, inthat film's quiet, realistic, and understated style, why did I findsuch deep resonance, but a love story where a comet (spoilers!!!) wipesout an entire town cannot? I have to spread the blame around to all inCreative.That being said, this is a very good animated film from Japan, but Ihave to say it doesn't quite live up to its hype. It's a bit too emoand heavy handed. There are many parts where the lead characters screamout each other's name. There's no subtlety at all. Me thinks that theamazing images fool people when married to a heavy handed approach topresenting emotional content. Another refresher if you want an awesomecoming of age story from Japanese masters, check out Whisper of theHeart. There's nothing in Your Name that matches the awe of Shizukudiscovering the antique shop for the first time, and meeting theBaron... (sigh) This, without even bringing up Spirited Away.
