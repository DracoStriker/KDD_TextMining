Undeniably one of the greatest anime films I have seen. And certainlyup there when it comes to films in general.The extremely rich and developed artwork was visually stimulating andengaging. Intoxicating the viewer immediately at the incredible detailand colors emanated throughout the film.The plot was very touching and quite emotional to see play out. The waythis film presents the story and incorporates themes of love, time, andwonder was phenomenal. The way everything weaved together wasinteresting to watch from beginning to end, and ultimately served for agreatly enjoyable and at times very emotional experience.There were humorous moments, there were sad moments, and other momentsof adrenaline and suspense. The main characters themselves wereinteresting and instantly relatable for me, causing me to identify withand care about them as the story progressed. The way that theirrelationship with one another develops and the journey they embark aseverything unfolds is well-done and quite memorable.There are a few twists and turns, and even though many people wouldhave an idea of how things would play out the film nonetheless does amasterful job of gripping the viewer and making them enjoy every secondof it. The twists that occurred were thought-provoking, as was theentire concept and what the film was trying to say in general. This istruly a memorable work of art for me, and one that I heavily recommendnot only to anime fans, but film fans in general.
