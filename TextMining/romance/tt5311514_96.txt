This is my first time writing a movie review, and that proves how greatthis anime is! The story is original, brilliant, and leaves rooms for the audience tohave a deeper thought of what they have just seen. The theme songs,background music are just perfect. Great drawings, attention todetails.Please try to stick to the Japanese version (I have heard that they arematching it with an English soundtrack), and avoid any spoiler, eventhe brief introduction of the movie, it's the best way to learn thewhole thing.I haven't seen a movie that great in years, strongly recommended. Justhope that the same thing will happen to me! Please help me god!!
