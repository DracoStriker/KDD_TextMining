The movie is simply amazing, I watched it several times by the way. Thestory is nice and the change of sequences are perfect. It gave me hopethat true love can survive against all drama in our life and even if wedie. The song (Zen Zen sense) is beautiful too, I like the music andlyrics too. Watch it you won't regret. ;)
