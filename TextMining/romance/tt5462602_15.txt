I watched this movie based purely on the high ratings and favorablereviews on IMDb... wish I hadn't bothered. Movies are subjective,that's for sure... one man's meat is another man's poison. Not sure whymy opinion of this movie is so contrary to the majority. Maybe thegenerational gap... I am an oldie. Or maybe because there have been somany really crap movies released recently that, comparatively, this onefares reasonably well.About 30 minutes into the movie I turned to my wife and said, "this isa load of rubbish". She nodded her head violently in agreement. Thereare a few good performances from established actors in the cast but, inthe main, this movie is boring and humorless. The main actor isapparently a stand-up comedian, I reckon he should probably stick withthat. His performance is flat and wooden, very amateurish. The Big Sickis maybe something the under 30s might enjoy but, as an oldie, Ithought it was far worse than ordinary.
