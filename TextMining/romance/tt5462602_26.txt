I wasn't sure what to expect from this film and what I got was a reallyentertaining experience. The film addresses some very, very importantissues like how to deal with cultural issues within your family andrelationships plus how to deal with illness. But at the same time, ittakes an amusing and funny take on life and its problems. The cast isterrific. Other than Anupam Kher, I was really not familiar with theactors playing Kumail's family and they were all great (special shoutout for Zenobia Shroff who despite appearing nowhere near old enough toactually be Kumail's mother, is absolutely terrific). And all of theactresses they found to play the prospective Pakistani brides were goodtoo. And Ray Romano and Holly Hunter were really great as Emily'sparents (Ray's performance in particular is Oscar worthy). Zoe Kazanwas perfectly cast (she even looks a little like the real Emily) andgave another in what has become a string of impressive performances.Obviously this is Kumail Nanjiani's film (it is based on his and hiswife Emily's life and was co-written by the two of them), so he has tonail the performance and he does. There are some very good laughs alongthe way (much of the film is set in a comedy club with Kumail and othercomedians doing their routines and interacting backstage), but firstand foremost this is a romance and a very good one. Really worthwhilefilm to see. Both enjoyable and a film that makes you think.
