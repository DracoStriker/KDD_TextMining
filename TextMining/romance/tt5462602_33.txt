It is difficult to understand the workings behind the scenes of thismovie. The acting was adequate, most aspects of the film wereadequate... but, it lacked any sort of magic, focus or direction.Yes, there were some funny bits, but overall a disappointment to myselfand the friends I watched it with. We were all left with a sense of -'can I have that time over again', and see something else.So much potential, so little result...
