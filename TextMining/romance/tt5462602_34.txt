I understand that different people have different tastes but I wassurprised to see such high praise for this movie. I found it tediousand not very funny at all.The lead actor is very good in his role in Silicon Valley but I found Ididn't really enjoy him as the lead for a 2 hour movie. I hate to sayit but he's not that funny (without being teamed up with Gilfoil thatis) and without a strong lead the movie becomes boring. The plot isnothing groundbreaking either, I found it to be very predicable.I kept waiting for things to get more interesting (or at least funnier)but it never happened. If you watch the 1st ten minutes and are notentertained you should probably just shut it off.Even the title is off-putting to me. I get that its a reference to thelove interest getting sick but its weird they went with "The Big Sick."To me it doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all.Perhaps my expectations were too high (movie is currently 7.9 on IMDb)but I didn't find this movie to be very entertaining. I have awarded afew starts based on the strength of some of the supporting actors,without them I would have shut this off within 30 minutes.
