I partly enjoyed this movie. It actually has a lot of good acting andrealistic dialogue. But! When it suits the plot, it goes straight intoridiculous overreaction, and that is a huge problem. Really the wholemovie, or the problem that need resolving, is based on a totallyannoying, extreme overreaction, and it really threw me off. Another problem is the fact that this revolves around a couple ofstruggling stand-up comedians, and you know what that means. Scenes ofstand-up comedy that are supposed to be realistic. It is cringe. I willsay it's not as bad as it could be, but still. There is something aboutfake stand-up comedy, just like fake improv, that just, it should notbe done. Stand-up comedy is funny because it's real. When it's fake, ittotally falls apart. With that said, it's better here than I've seenother places, at least.The movie is too long. As a comedy I don't think it works very well. Ismiled liked a couple of times. Now I may be a tough crowd, but still,I did expect a couple of chuckles at least. What impressed me the most here is Ray Romano. He does an absolutelyexcellent role. He does not play Ray from the Everybody Loves Raymondhere. He's much more of a believable normal guy. He was possibly thebest thing about the whole movie. Really good.The other actors are good too, but occasionally I got that, we'reactors-vibe. 'See how natural we act? We are really natural! We jokeand banter and all! Hey we are like totally natural yall! See how werealistically laugh at each others jokes'? Ugh, Sorry, but I just hatethat. In a couple of scenes they are supposed to be joking andbantering with each other, and it is not funny at all.The Big Sick has some heart, I'll give it that. It's a pretty gooddrama, with failed attempts at comedy. But Ray Romano really stole theshow. And why does the critics love it? My guess is because it portraysanother culture. Critics are suckers for that. (or they are just afraidto be called the r-word)
