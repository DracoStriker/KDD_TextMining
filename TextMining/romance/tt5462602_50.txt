I went because my wife wanted to see it. My expectations were of apredictable romantic heart-string puller. Oh, it will pull on heartstrings, and it is romantic--but it is also one of the best films I'vehad the fortunate experience to see. The acting is first-rate; thestory is compelling, and the Director weaves the story beautifully. Theactors quickly make you forget their professional persona and bring youinto the soul of their part, and you leave the theater feeling that youactually know these people. The cultural exposure is quite real andauthentic, and will enrich those who have never experienced such abasic conflict. A worthwhile evening spent!
