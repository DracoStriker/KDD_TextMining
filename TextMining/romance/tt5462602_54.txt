The Big Sick is a movie you need to see before it is on DVD. I was notwanting to see this movie, but at the very end of it I changed my mindit was truly amazing a must see for adults everywhere. The film willhave you laughing the whole entire time. The actors were fantastic.This was a great cast for this you could tell they really lived theirrole it was perfection in it loved every bit. Parents the Big Sick is Rated R for Language and some SextualReferences so this film is not good for the little ones. If you decideto take your little ones let them know that if they laugh there maybesome things they won't understand till they are older. The Big Sick will defiantly make your movie year besides Dunkirk. Ifyou liked this review check out my review for Dunkirk. Thank you forreadingThe Big Sick my score 10/10
