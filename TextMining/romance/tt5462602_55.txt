I loved this movie. Everything about it. It was witty, hilarious,awkward and a lot of fun. This movie is what every romantic comedyshould look up to. This movie is about a Pakistani man, Kumail, whofalls in love with this girl who later ends up in a coma. The film ismore "touchy-feely" than Apatow's other movies like Superbad, but stilljust as many laughs. Kumail starts to get to know her parents and themovie moves on from there. The acting: Kumail Nanjiani (who plays himself) was great. He went frombeing the sexual masseuse in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, to this.He was incredibly awkward and funny, but really gave a good performancefor a rom-com. Holly Hunter and Ray Romano were both fantastic. IfHunter does not get nominated at the Oscars it is a shame. Theircharacters were both hysterical, especially when they interacted withKumail in such a serious situation. And, look out for Kumail's family,especially his mom and brother. They made the movie for me.It is a front runner for me for the summer. It competes with rom-comslike Bridesmaids, Trainwreck and When Harry met Sally. Watch it!
