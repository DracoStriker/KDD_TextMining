Kumail is a very funny and down to earth person. This autobiographicalfilm is about the conflict between traditions of a family he loves andthe girl he is madly in love with and it feels like a movie aboutKumail. It is funny, but not overboard, it is personal and it issincere. After I finished watching it I was sorry I didn't wait to seeit with the wife, since it is one of those romantic movies that don'tleave a sour shitty taste in your mouth after seeing them.While it is not terribly innovative and can be even called predictable,I enjoyed watching the performance of all the actors involved and Ifound myself laughing at some scenes. I almost never do that. Watch it!
