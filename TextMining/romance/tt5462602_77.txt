I have always been a big fan of Kumail. I love his stand-up and I lovehim on Silicon Valley, but in this film, he really outdoes himself.It's a beautiful story and as writers, he and Emily did a beautiful jobbalancing the sadness in the story with the hilarious parts. I lovethis film, I've seen it too many times to say.
