This film depicts a couple's challenge in grappling with the culturaldifferences of their Pakistani and white American families in thisportrayal of the protagonist's real-life relationship. Kumail Nanjianiand Zoe Kazan are wonderful in their respective performances as thecouple that gradually weaves together an amazing story. Ray Romano andHolly Hunter are equally splendid as the parents of the girlfriend. Infact, there are no weak links in the cast.It's a film that goes from being a diverting portrayal of the life of astand-up comic to a romance story to an allegory on overcoming culturalbarriers in the United States. The tonal shifts might seem extreme atfirst, but they gradually cement a powerful narrative that makes for alot of laughs but also becomes bittersweet and endearing withoutresorting to a hint of sentimentality.The film takes on a new form when the girlfriend is beset with a severeillness. From there, the comedy aspect gradually becomes something of asupporting part to a deeper character study and exploration of familyand cultural pressures even in the face of unanticipated grave events.You will laugh, you will be close to tears and you might engage in yourown introspection after watching this film. Brilliantly written andbeautifully acted, this one is from the heart. Recommended to thehighest degree.
