It was not so funny. It was not so good. But it was predictable. Theplot is... well... not boring, but... disappointing. To tell a storylike this one you need more than characters, you need feelings andemotions, things that I didn't noticed at all. Everything was put intoplace, only souls weren't. It could have been much better andinteresting. So, who's to blame? I'm not a judge, but if I realizesomething is not working, I can not just sit in the corner and not sayanything.
