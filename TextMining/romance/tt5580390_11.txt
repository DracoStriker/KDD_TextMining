To be seen and desired for who we truly are; it is the passionate wishof many. For Elisa, an unassuming and kind-hearted maid in a 1960s eragovernment lab, this wish is granted in an unusual way. Virtuallyinvisible and isolated, yet content in her little bubble, Elisa islured from this comfort zone as she witnesses the arrival of a strange,monstrous sea creature in the lab. Despite warnings to keep herdistance, Elisa sympathizes with the suffering creature. It is inchains and tortured by Strickland, a sadistic and violent governmentagent. This wild creature is impulsive. It responds to aggression withthe same, and to kindness with kindness. As the cruelty of Stricklandescalates, Elisa decides she must act to save the creature. Friendlyand opposing forces emerge from unlikely places to help or hinder her.Love and light hinge on the erratic hearts of monsters and humansalike.This thrilling, touching and surreal film explores the many forms andaspects of monsters. The worst monster of them all is the human heart,and yet it is also the most kind and beautiful. The film offers aptencouragement to speak up and act when others are in trouble and inpain. In this world of rising fascists who peddle hatred and oppositionto science, art, sympathy and basically to all humanity, suchencouragement is sorely needed.With expressive eyes and strong empathy, Sally Hawkins is amazing andmesmerizing in her portrayal of Elisa. Michael Shannon is perfectlycast as the crude, cruel, sarcastic and controlling Strickland. InStrickland's sinful, selfish and negative world, the monster is betteroff dead. The supporting cast is wonderful. The film is full of depthand splendor. The Southern United States is the setting, yet the filmwas shot in Toronto. The theater that appears prominently on screen isthe very same theater (the Elgin) in which I saw the film at theToronto International Film Festival. I went into the theater with highhopes and was not disappointed.
