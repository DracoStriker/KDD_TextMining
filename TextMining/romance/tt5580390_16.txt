Aside from the central premise of a romance between a human woman andan amphibious humanoid, "The Shape of Water" and "Mrs. Caliban" havenothing in common. Dorothy is a bereaved mother estranged from herhusband who meets Larry after he's escaped; Elisa is a mute orphan whofinds the Asset while cleaning the lab where he's being held anddecides to help him get free. A cursory watching of the trailer for"The Shape of Water" should make it clear it's telling a differentstory than Ingalls' book.
