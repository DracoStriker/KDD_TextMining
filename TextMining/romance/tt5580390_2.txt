I saw this film at TIFF in Sept, and it is absolutely brilliant. It ismuch needed in today's world, because it sub textually shows us aboutthe outdated thoughts on masculinity, sexuality and love. It shows usthat love can blossom anywhere. It may be my favorite del Toro film,which is saying a lot. Please click the link to watch my video review, and I hope you enjoy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPXZhbiGf4Q
