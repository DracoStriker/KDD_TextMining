Guillermo Del Toro's newest film "The Shape of Water" took my breathaway. Easily this is Del Toro's finest film since "Pan's Labyrinth" andmay even be his best in general. This is a film where Del Toro weavesmagic throughout with a story he created which is simple, yet layeredwith such interesting facets embedded in each character, set, and propas he allows the audience to discover this intimate and fascinatingworld of "broken" people searching for a moment of meaning. Captivatingfrom its opening scenes with haunting visual imagery, and a lyricalscore by Alexandre Desplat, one is immediately enthralled by this fairytale that is not your usual saccharine variety that Disney cranks out.Del Toro knows how to tell a story with wit, style and heart.Assembling a cast headed by the incandescent Sally Hawkins in the roleof Eliza who is mute throughout the film, but exudes such humanity andstrength along with the villainous Michael Shannon who provides a greatbalance. Every single actor sparkles because every character has beendeveloped with great care. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer shine intheir roles bringing a touch of quirkiness and humor to this sometimesdark story.The film is achingly nostalgic with glorious production design by PaulD. Austerberry evoking the Baltimore of 1962 full of fascinatingtextures of faded glory, especially in the magnificent design ofEliza's apartment and hallways. Exquisite camera work by Dan Laustsenand beautifully designed costumes by Luis Sequiera contribute greatlyto complete Guillermo Del Toro's vision.This film is really the ultimate version of "Beauty and The Beast" witha touch of "ET", capped off with a very emotional investment, that paysoff for the audience in its poetic and lyrical final scene. Certainly one of the finest films of 2017.
