Well acted, gorgeously photographed and competently directed, thisdepressing true tale is oddly cold and sterile. Garfield and Foy areexcellent but the end result is sadly forgettable. The great Diana Riggshows up in a why bother 3 minutes or less cameo. Good intentions onthe filmmakers part and a fascinating true story make for a filmlacking emotional impact.
