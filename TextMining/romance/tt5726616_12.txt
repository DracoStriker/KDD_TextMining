I really wanted to like this film. I read the book when it came out; Iam a gay man; I love films about love relationships between beautifulmen; I love films with bits of European languages and lovely Europeansettings; I am 'pro' art house films which are all about characters andtake their time. But this didn't work. Firstly, it was really too long.But my main problem was that the relationship between Elio and Oliverjust didn't ring true. OK, a few small things happened between themwhich could have been seen as sexual (e.g. the shoulder massage), butthey were both busy doing things with women a lot. Nothing wrong withbeing bi! And Elio is meant to be young, finding himself etc. But oneday, he suddenly says to Oliver that he needs to tell him something,and Oliver says he knows what it is - but there really hasn't beenenough evidence of that building up. I do realise that reading anarticle about Hammer which said that he had a clause added to hiscontract restricting the amount of sex and nudity he would be expectedto do - well that made me struggle to see sincerity in his acting.Chalumet on the other hand is a great discovery. The way he holds aclose-up all through the closing titles, showing a range of emotions,is very impressive indeed. I can remember so clearly what it was likeat 17 (OK yes, 50 years ago) to kind of enjoy feeling sad and thenelated about love and sex, and Chalumet shows that brilliantly. But heis not enough to save this film, and nor is the man playing his father,who does such an excellent job of channelling Robin Williams.
