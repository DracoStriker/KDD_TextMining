Homosexual, coming of age, erotic drama. A film about sexual awakeningand sexual discovery.Set in Italy, in the summer of 1983. The father figure is a historyprofessor who always takes an annual summer-time intern.The son, Elio, played by Tim Chalamet is the 17 year old son, whospends his days playing classical music and reading. The intern, Oliver, played by Armie Hammer is the charming 20something, intellectual intern who lives with the family to help withthe professor's research.Elio and Oliver have truly great chemistry and slowly grow closer,frustration turns into infatuation which turns into love. Elio andOliver have several very emotional, romantic scenes until Oliverinevitably returns home and emotions boil over. Look out for the very best scene in the film towards the end where thefather discussed the prior few week's emotional events with Elio duringan extended dialogue scene (a master-class in parenting). If Moonlight can win the 'Best Picture' Oscar then this film has morereasons to do the same! A 'Best Actor' Oscar for Armie also lookspossible.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
