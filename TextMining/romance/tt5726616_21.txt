'Call Me By Your Name', a film about first love and heartbreak. Thecinema where it was showing was packed for a festival that this was apart of. This film is tipped for the Oscars and I can well see why. Itis a mature film set in 1983 in Italy and perfectly captures a boy'sfirst love and heartbreak in losing that love. It does it without mushysentimentality, just truth. The final scene were the credits role andthe camera concentrates on the boy's face for 6 minutes as you see theheartbreak set into his features will surely go down as one of thegreat cinematic moments ever captured on film. In many ways this filmis challenging, in that it portrays a love affair between an older man(mid to late 20s) and a teenage boy of 17. But the emotion expressed insuch an honest way could apply to anyone gay or straight and audiencesare flocking to see it. Both of their lives are messy and it's notstraight forward, the older man is quite unlikable and arrogant andit's only as their affair starts that you see the real person blossom.The boy has his first sexual encounter with a girl from his town. Butthe empathy of his father and acceptance of his son's great love, alove that the father says he never had nor never will, pushes this filmbeyond mere stereotypes and cliché. The final sequence will leave youemotional, if you have ever had your heart broken at a young age youwill see the truth in the boy's face and be grateful that the boy takeshis father's message of 'feel the pain, don't bury it, treasure it'. Ifit wins an Oscar it is well deserved.
