Apart from being distracted by the mother obviously having neverhavinvg smoked a cigarette in her life (couldn't someone have coachedher?)....the acting was good. The scenery was very nice...but the storywas dull. If you watch the first 10 minutes and aren'tinterested....bail out. It doesn't get better.I stopped watching after 1 and a half hours. The other 2 people with meagreed.I never read the book. I'm wondering if all the 10/10 reviews are forthe book. not the film. I really tried to like the film but I couldn't.
