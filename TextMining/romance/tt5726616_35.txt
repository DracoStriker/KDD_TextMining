This movie has gotten very good reviews, and I was excited when I sawit during a film festival in Oslo, even opening film. The story takesplace in Italy in 1983. A wealthy Italian family receives an Americanmale researcher who will live with them for 6 weeks. The meetingbetween him and the family's teenage son is the foundation of the storyin this film. The film depicts the tension between the two, whicheventually evolve into a close friendship. A friendship that evolvesinto a sexual relationship. The film is beautifully portrayed. The twomen unfold in a beautiful landscape. But film is slow and brieflydepicts how the contact between the two evolves. In my opinion, thefilm could be have shorter, and would have benefited on that. It's atoo slow and somewhat tedious. The film's content is also not very new,but it's beautifully filmed. It also reflects on a theme that showsthat we are not going back so many years back before gay relationshipswere taboo and that such love had to be hidden. In addition, this isalso about an adult man initiating a relationship with a teenage boy.There is solid craftsmanship in both filming, acting and role- playing.But the direction could have been tighter, in my opinion, and the filmis too long. But I still enjoyed seeing it.
