Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie that makes you sit throughthe credits with tears rolling down your face, staring blankly at thescreen with a lump in your throat and tightness in your chest. Call Me By Your Name is not a tragic movie. It's not a sad movie. It'snot a pretentious movie. It's a movie about love, and love, and love. Abeautiful love that will leave you longing to find your own love anddrown in it. Timothée Chalamet is an absolute force of nature. Elio will make youwant to love, and hurt, and piece yourself back together withabsolutely no regrets whatsoever. Elio will make you want to live yourlife to the fullest. Elio will make you want to break your own damnheart. It's so rare that a performance truly shows the depth oflonging, and despair, and passion a character conveys through writtenwords without the internal monologue. Timothée is truly a revelationand his last scene during the credits will have a lasting impact oneveryone.Armie Hammer is absolutely brilliant in the way he humanizes Oliver whois somewhat glorified through Elio's lens in the first part of thebook. In the movie, Oliver is endearing and human and sexy and caring.He cares for Elio, and his love for him is so tender and so touchingMichael Stuhlbarg's monologue delivered nearing the end of the film isa complete masterpiece, and without a doubt that monologue with betaught and quoted for many years to come. A raw and beautiful scene.Watch this movie. Watch it, and love it, and don't let it fall victimto over-hype. Watch this movie. Fall in love in two hours and twelveminutes, then question every single time you didn't allow yourself tofeel just because you were afraid of getting hurt. Was avoiding apossible heartbreak that might have shattered you worth never getting ataste of the heavens? Was killing the potential pain and heartacheworth it? Was it worth it?
