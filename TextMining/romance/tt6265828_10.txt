Casey Affleck decided to make a joke. He joint forces with David Loweryto create something much worse than Upstream Color. They created a mega- boring 90 minutes of long scenes about nothing. However, there was ascene in the movie, which fully expressed my feelings. It is a scene,where main character vomits. I am sure, that if I eat for some reasontoo much, it will be enough to recall this movie to achieve samereaction.
