I went for a haircut a few years ago and a hairdresser I'd never hadbefore, waxed lyrical about how she wasn't just a hairdresser..she wasan artist. I ended up bored to death and paying a fortune for the worsthaircut I've ever had. I'd never had a comparable experience until Iwatched this film. Some of the shots were so long it felt like it hadbeen paused, I mean you could literally go and have a meal and missnothing. There is no deep meaning to this that none of us hasdiscovered yet. This film would have been a whole lot better if he hadjust gone into the light at the start. I like films that are differentand that do make you feel something but this just isn't one of them.
