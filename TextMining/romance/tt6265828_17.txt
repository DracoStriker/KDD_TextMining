This minimalist fantasy-drama by David Lowery portrays the journey of adeceased man's ghost who returns to the home where he and his wifelived together up until his untimely and tragic death. To describe theghost's psychology in this journey might be giving away too much. Theplot is straightforward but it addresses themes of human existence andeternity in a way that many big-budget films don't even try.The ghost's simplistic form might seem odd or laughable at first. Thiswas not the case with me. I found the ghost's emergence and entry intothe film to be seamless and thoroughly convincing. The narrativeinitially dissects local aspects of the plot, such as what type ofrelationship the man had with his wife and who he seemed to be as aperson. Then it proceeds to become something much more ambitious-waxing philosophical on how we spend our time on Earth and whatmeaning, if any, we should hope to derive from it. The film'saugmentation in scope can be risky for a small, unpretentious work, butin the end, it resonates quite well.As for the performances, everyone here is great but Rooney Mara isexceptionally understated here, not the least for the scene where sheeats an entire pie in a moment of intense pain. She is able to conveythe grave reality of mourning without ever resorting to histrionics orconventional acting displays. She is low-key and completely effectivehere, as is Casey Affleck who portrays the detached husband. Theyworked with director Lowery in the lesser film "Ain't Them BodiesSaints", but here their collaboration reaches greater heights.As simple as this ghost appears, there is never a dearth of sympathy ordoubt about its presence. The film's uses of long takes and pregnantsilence create an unexpected degree of tension. It deploys a soundtrackthat is alternately mournful and quirky. And for all the melancholymood that pervades, there are discreet moments of humor, making for abittersweet cinematic work of art. Strongly recommended.
