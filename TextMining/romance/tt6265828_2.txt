The movie had great promise. A husband dies and then comes back towatch his wife's life move forward. How will she react? What will histhoughts be? Who else will be part of their lives? It would have beeninteresting if we would have learned what he thought about her life andthe lives of others who lived in the house; however, except for onefamily who had children, we don't really know. I guess his irritationrelated to the fact that there were children in the house, which musthave been his dream. Shallow and unoriginal.While most scenes were slow, two were achingly slow: the scene in bedat the beginning and the pie-eating scene. "Just eat the pie, please."There were two other scenes in which our ghost "communicated" with aghost in another house. The audience I was with laughed out loud. Iwanted them to get together to share their pain or to develop some typeof relationship. That would have been no more banal than their talk.The movie helped me greatly in one respect. I know that others likedthis movie. I have read the replies. I can't understand why, however. Iam able to realize that that makes me narrow-minded and that I have tobe careful of that.
