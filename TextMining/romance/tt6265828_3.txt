My wife and I went to see this movie yesterday. We both like the starsof the movie so we gave it a chance. From the beginning every scene wasdrawn out for several minutes I guess for dramatic purposes however ifthat was the reason it didn't work. There was a scene that was about 10minutes long just watching a pie being eaten. The movie had hardly anydialogue and was like the pie eating scene just a cobbled togetherbunch of long drawn out scenes for no apparent reason. It would havebeen more exciting to watch my 30.00 swirl down the toilet thanwatching this complete boor fest.
