This film tells the story of a man who dies in a car accident. He goesback to his home as a ghost covered in a white sheet, and watch theworld goes by and goes on.Casey Affleck must have the least screen time ever for a leadingcredit. He appears in the film for a total of ten to fifteen minutesonly. Anyone could have been under that white sheet, so it might nothave been him.This film lacks any story. It is so slow that I watched it at threetimes the speed and still thought it was far too slow. Watching RooneyMara eat a pie for seven minutes is not interesting. Watching a ghoststanding motionless for three minutes isn't interesting either. Infact, the whole film is not interesting. It seems like someone's verymean and twisted practical joke, by making a bad film and see how thecritics declare that they love it.
