If you are going to see this at the cinema, bring a box of matches soyou can keep your eyes pried open while you attempt to stay awake. Ifyou suffer from any form of depression do not watch this movie. If youwant to suffer some depression, watch this movie. It is bleakness atits dreariest. It is not entertaining in any way, it does not conveyany messages of wisdom, it doesn't have a single uplifting bone in itsweighed down dusty skeleton. Watching a corpse decompose for an hourand a half might be more rewarding than watching this.
