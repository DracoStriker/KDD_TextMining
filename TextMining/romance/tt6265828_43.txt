This director tried so hard to rip off that sack of Russian craptist,Andrei Barfosky. There was another craptist called Alejandro Inarittuwho tried to copy Barfosky with The Revenant and that was a slow,boring, technically pandering piece of crap too. This here is nodifferent. Long takes, static shots, really bad cinematography, andjust ugly like every Barfosky movie. What do we get in a world full ofoverpraised craptist like Emmanuel Lubezki, Andrei Barfosky, IngridBergman, Alejandro Inarritu, or the king of sack of them all,Hitchcock? We get pretentious cinema, nothing more. All their moviessuck and this one sucks just the same.0/10 like every one of their films.
