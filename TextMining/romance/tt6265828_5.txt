A pretentious example of a bad Bergman movie. The publicity uses theword "meditation" to excuse the fact that it has no characters, action,or plot. The scenes are static and frequently the only movement is thecamera slowly zooming in or out. I suppose this is to give the movie anartsy feel. The message of the movie is that people die and times moveson. That is all you will learn, and if you didn't figure that out bythe time you were fourteen . . . We learn almost nothing about thecharacters or their context. They mostly move and talk like zombies,which is a waster of some very good talent. Midway through the moviethere is a long speech by an unnamed character I call The Gasbag,pointing out the obvious about life as if it were a newly discoveredinsight. It is really just a voice over that leads nowhere. None of theother actors in the scene react to it at all. When I saw it I honestlythought it was ironic, and the movie was going to satirize the genre ofintellectually barren self-important indie files, but to my horror Idiscovered that the director was being serious. There is no humor inthe movie, no humanity, no spontaneous moments. When you leave thetheater you are not informed, moved, or entertained, just ground down.I compared it to another movie people often walked out of, The Tree ofLife, but even though Tree of Life was overlong, self indulgent andbadly edited, there was a compelling story at the middle. Stay home.
