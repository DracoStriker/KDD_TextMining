Now, after reading other reviews here, I feel lucky I've watched thiscrap only first 30 minutes -then I skipped to last 10 minutes. Hey,don't envy me, it was pure luck :-) Anyway, I still regret watchingR.Mara eating for over 5 minutes. I wonder.. people actually pay to seethis "movie"?And you know what? Now I find "no-signal" screensaver on my TV quiteentertaining.
