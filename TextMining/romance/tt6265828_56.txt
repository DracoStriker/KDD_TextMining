Definitely not what I was expecting given the acting talent involved,it felt like the aim of the movie was to present a montage of abjectlytedious scenes, and then try and drag those scenes out to the pointwhere you start to feel anger building. I don't mind movies withoutspecial effects or all that much happening, but there at least has tobe an interesting story to carry things along, Casey Affleck lurkingabout in a sheet in a succession of utterly dull scenes just isn't veryentertaining.Basically this movie is the equivalent of those weird art pieces whereit's just a bunch of old litter in a urinal, but people try to tell youthat it's art and you just don't get it...well in this case I'mabsolutely fine with not getting it.
