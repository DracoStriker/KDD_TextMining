Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara are probably the most cute and realisticcouple I have ever seen.This is a very weird movie. It starts very slow and you don't reallyunderstand why, but as the movie goes you realize that it is not onlyabout mourning, it is also about human existence and genuine love.Few movies has made me cry in only 10 minutes.
