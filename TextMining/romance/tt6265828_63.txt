I found this film indulgent and poor. The love relationship wasn'tadequately developed, the overlong scenes, virtually no dialogues,limited sound and a white sheet in every scene was a bit much.Meditation on love and loss? Plenty of meditation but not sure whatabout. I sat through the film but I wouldn't have missed anything bywalking out.
