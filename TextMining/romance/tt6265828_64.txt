A young man dies and returns as a ghost to silently observe and occupythe home he once lived in. Time passes, his widow moves out, but theghost waits. Very early in this film you notice how stunning thecinematography is, a sure sign that the story is lacking in depth.There are hints of Terence Malick's 'The Tree of Life' here, and someof The Time Machine's ideas on the non-linearity of time. But the filmoffers nothing substantial or insightful. Long takes force us to engagefor uncomfortably extended periods with one frame, but there is nothingespecially thought-provoking or insightful on offer. A woman gorgingherself on pie is an especially egregious example, a scene that was thetrigger for the series of walk-outs that took place at the art-housecinema in Scotland where I watched this. A party bore offers up avacuous speech on the fragility and indeterminacy of existence that aliterature undergrad would blush at, never mind a middle-aged man. Themain content of conversation post-viewing was whether this scene or thepie-eating was more tedious. A ghost that can walk through walls spendsliterally an eternity trying to fish a piece of paper out of a wall.The film has one of those ambiguous endings that is the calling cardkop-out of the art-house poseur filmmaker. It is beautifully filmed,exquisitely so, but it is scant compensation for the tritestorytelling.
