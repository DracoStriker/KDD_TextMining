Getting through this film was honestly a real challenge. About half-way through the never-ending pie scene my wife and I turned to eachother and laughed, she apologised (it was her choice after all),"something is bound to happen sooner or later, let's just wait and see"I said. Wrong! Absolutely nothing happens of significance over the remaining 50minutes or so. Furthermore, it transpired we were no where near'half-way' through the pie eating, 'M' hadn't even slumped to the flooryet. As to the longevity of this part, other reviewers have articulatedthat well enough, personally once I'd progressed through various stagesof anticipation and then boredom I ended up dwelling over her pooreating technique and the damage she may be doing to the non-sticklining of the tin, especially as it wasn't even hers to begin with.My advice would be to walk out/switch off at this point just so you cansay you got through this infamous scene. Maybe you're one of the luckyones and you experienced a kaleidoscope of raw emotions, a commentaryon the meaning of loss and life, or whatever. Most of us just saw awomen eating pie for an insulting length of time, she was a bit upsetbut between the huge mouthfuls and cheeks full of food, inconclusivewhether it had anything to do with 'C' or more likely just therealisation that for this scene she had to consume the whole damn*sugar-free, gluten-free, vegan* chocolate pie.The greatest enjoyment I got from this experience was reading thereviews here immediately afterwards, especially those espousing thescope, beauty and reflective qualities of this 'masterpiece'. It wouldcertainly be a boring world if we all thought and interpretedeverything the same but in my opinion this film is an insider joke andthe positive commentary is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes.
