A Ghost Story is about the entrapment of souls in spaces they can'tleave forever. They may be forced to do things that keep everyonedistant but its the closeness they want out of it. Change is too fastand the slow-paced past times may be what is more comfortable. Theeternal wait here can be juxtaposed with whatever the viewer is goingthrough and that's the beauty of it.
