The flick doesn't do anything for me. Pretentious was a good word iread but i think that's judging but most closely a good critique. Why?I think the writer and folks involved had some 'messages' to send theviewer but it's 'pretentious' , too vane of them to think i'd 'get' or'understand' what they want to convey. A person could projectpsychology and philosophy to this film but a person would have just asmuch right to project psychology and philosophy to watching paint drylike another reviewer said. The picture was shot in that non fullscreen mode to make it more artsy and 'spooky' and draw my attention tothat 'this is different'. It is different. It is slow, too slow, frombeginning to end. And, probably, people who believe in 're-incarnation'or 'life after (and before) death' could have fun impuning things tothis film. ONE BIG DISLIKE OF THE FILM IS THERE IS NO HUMOR WHEN THEREIS, OR SHOULD BE, HUMOR IN LIFE AND DEATH. The film doesn't have to beglum and sad and so contemplative to get across the mystery of what'is'. A masterpiece of this kind of stuff is 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' whichis around a 3 hour flick with no words, low budget, which says so muchmore than this film. At least, i think so. This is such a 'sad sack'film and didn't do much for me. I felt the show could have gonesomewhere. But, it would have to be done entirely differently. Ha Ha.'Baba Ho-Tep' is a FILM OF GREAT DEPTH with fantastic humor, acting andcreativity which says tons more about life and death and 'what is' thanthis glum flick does. 'BABBA HO-TEP', i think , is the top of the linethat other films ought to try to grade themselves by. The thing has somuch humor yet so so much more to say. This film falls way to short ofthe mark as it tries to demand way too much of me that i can not give.
