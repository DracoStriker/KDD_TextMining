this movie is not for everyone. Don't be fooled by the "ghost" in thetitle.Its not a horror movie. its actually a drama movie and a reallysad in times too.it deals with very depressing things without muchdialogue so if your not into that stuff don't even watch themovie.you'll hate it.I personally like those things but it kinda buggedme that it was that slow paced though i understand why it is that way.Ifind the first act kinda boring.It wasn't until the second act that igot what the movie is all about and i got more invested in the story.Isnot the best movie of the year but its pretty good if you likemelodramatic and sad movies.
