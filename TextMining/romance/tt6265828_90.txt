I honestly can't believe I managed to sit half way through this. It'sliterally an hour and a half of a dead guy under a sheet watching hiswidowed girlfriend from afar. 99% of the movie is silent. I get thatthe long drawn out scenes that make up most of this film are suppose tobe artsy and emotional and dramatic, but it was so overdone that itfelt like I was watching the whole thing in slow motion. There was ascene of her eating pie on the floor for like 5 straight minutes. Notdoing anything, not saying anything. Just eating pie. No word of a lie,I literally fell asleep on accident, took a short nap, woke up and thisgirl was still eating pie. This film had so much potential but failedmiserably. If i wanted to listen to somber music and watch a womansilently feel sorry for herself for an hour and a half I'd visit mymother.
