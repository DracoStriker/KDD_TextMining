I had no expectations before watching this movie. I thought it will wasa Horror flick, that is not my favorite genre.From the beginning to the end, it has the essence of a great movie.Reminding the childhood days of Cinema, a great essence of nostalgia ofthe Classic films. Shot in 1.33 : 1, and steady frames, it sometimessuffocates the audience, that was the best point. What we don't seecreates curiosity and it holds us into the film. Some shots were toolong (for example the Pie scene) but the end makes us to realize why itwas so long. Frames were really beautiful. It could blend the essence of yesteryearand the prosperity of today.Highly recommended for serious film lovers. #KiduMovie
