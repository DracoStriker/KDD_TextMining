I don't understand how someone sober would spend 1h30 looking at stillframes over and over again. The message that the movie tries to delivercould be done in 10min. When i realized that most of the scenes wereliterally 2 minutes long still frames, i gave up watching the film innormal speed. Instead i fast forward it 10sec at a time to realize thati didn't miss a thing. Very very poor...
