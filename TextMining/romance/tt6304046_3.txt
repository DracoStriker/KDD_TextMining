Back from the cinema and i am still...wow wow wow.It was just a kinda boring evening, so i took a walk to my favouritecinema in Reykjavik downtown spontaneous.Unfortunately it was the smallest cinema hall but OK i took a set inthe middle of the second seat row. So it was like the last seat row inthe big cinema hall. Everything was quiet, not many peoples...perfect.And the movie started, first scene, what the hell, OK, curious,interesting and from the beginning to the end, it was just an exciting,stunning, enigmatic thrill of a young woman with epilepsy and what canhappen if.....The best movie 2017 i have seen so far!
