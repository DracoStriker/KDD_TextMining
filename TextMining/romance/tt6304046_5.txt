A wonderful combination of mutation, mystery and revolutionaryscientific thoughts and ideas. All the way to the end it blasts throughsome premature human reflexes along with their dreadful consequences onthe mind of a young female student. She suffers from several unwantedand uncharacterstic cellular actions that totally destroyed herlife.These changes sometimes organic and sometimes mental..Those arebeyond the limits of medical laws and equations..Only can be explainedby some complex rules of science. This is where the movie standsextraordinary to me. As it slowly created the background where the plothas reached it's peak and then has revealed whatever thoughts andanswers it can provide the audiences. The director has done efficientlythe full work of creating mystery and then unfolding it. And thisexcellent work has been accompanied by the ruthless as well assplendind acting of the participants.Those like to watch sci-fi movies specially super hero or mutation likeX-man movies will enjoy it surely.
