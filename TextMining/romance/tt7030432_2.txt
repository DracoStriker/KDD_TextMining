Not sure if it's a 7 Star, but it's close. It's a nice, brand newheartwarming Christmas movie. Who doesn't like Lacey Chabert? She's theone who deserves the 7 Stars, for sure. I'm a big fan of hers on theseHallmark movies. She's got that Hallmark charm I love. And wow, thosegingerbread creations were just amazing. Who does that? I've nevercreated a gingerbread house or whatever for that matter. Some day, Imight think about it. Maybe when two heads are in it together. Thatwill be the day. Until then, it's only in film. Great 2017 holidaychick flick from Hallmark!
