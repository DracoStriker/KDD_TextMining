Before writing a review I generally go through all the reviews writtenbefore mine to have a better idea of my own understanding. However theymake me feel like I am attending an award function were high marks aredeliberately being given to select actors. Coming back to the movie, itis a story of two lonely people who meet each other through a datingsite. You will have to watch the movie to find out what happens next.The movie pace is okay and the direction is very good. Irrfan andParvathy, both are fabulous in their roles. The cameos do not offeranything great and in turn hinder the pace of the movie. One of thegood things is that both the characters have some back stories and theyare explained to viewers with the flow of the movie. Conversationsbetween characters are not too long but eventful. So they do not boreyou. Although the story is not that strong, yet performances anddirection overcome them up to a great extent.
