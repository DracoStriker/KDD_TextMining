A decidedly odd film, with a very wonky premise. Two people meetthrough a dating site. They go on a trip together to see the guy's pastgirlfriends, which is strange, but interesting. Throughout the triphowever, the two of them act like prissy Hindi movie lovers from the70s, though they're supposed to be 35 and 40 years old. When heaccidentally sees her naked coming out of the bathroom, they bothscream and scream like they were having their teeth pulled. They don'ttouch, they don't kiss, though they met on a dating site. They seemtotally asexual. Director Tanuja Chandra is in her 50s, so her jadedapproach to romance may be forgiven. But dialogue writer GhazalDhaliwal is a new gen woman and should have written it better. Take thescene where our heroine Parvathy wakes up to find Irfaan asleep on thecouch. She makes such a tiresome fuss with the "How did you get into myroom?" dialogue repeated ten times. The critics have generally giventhis film a good rating, which is surprising. Maybe it's because theother Hindi films doing the rounds these days are worse.
