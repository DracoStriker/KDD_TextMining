A very 'schmalzy' story, at the level of the Princess' diaries, butnicely done. Rose McIver is just enough 'innocent looking' to make thiswork. Nicest performance by Honor Kneafsey as the handicapped princess,gaining confidence from her non-teacher. Of course the bad guy and girlare caricatures. Ben Lamb is a prince as the story demands; Alice Krigeappears the run-of-the-mill conservative, old queen, but with a fewdevious traits she saves the role. In short, sentimental, but justright for Christmas.
