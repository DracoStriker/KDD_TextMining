That Sidney Lumet knows how to frame an actor within his or hercharacter is a very well known fact - "The Pawnbroker" "Network" "DogDay Afternoon" and some other spectacular pieces of acting prove thatpoint unquestionably. Here, there is a sort of "divertissment". AgathaChristie given a first class treatment (not that Margaret Rutherford asMiss Marple wasn't first class, but the production value here is asimpressive as the cast) in the hands of Sidney Lumet who knew how toput a bunch of sensational actors in a confined space - "12 Angry Men"for instance and make it riveting. There a 12 Angry people here too and(almost) each part is cast with relish and delight. Albert Finney,marvelous, manages, not only to survive, under the weight of hischaracterization but to create something bold, exquisitely structured,great fun to watch and to hear. Ingrid Bergman won her third Oscar forher missionary looking after little brown babies - I thought she was ahighlight indeed but in my modest opinion, Valentina Cortese for "DayFor Night" deserved it that year, Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates'stwin brother, also with a mother fixation and a compelling facial tic.Wendy Hiller was, clearly, having a ball and that, on the screen, isalways contagious. Sean Connery and Vanessa Redgrave make asurprisingly hot pair, Lauren Bacall over does it of course but whocares, Jacqueline Bisset is breathtaking, Rachel Roberts a hoot. JohnGielgud is John Gielgud and that in itself is a major plus. ColinBlakely does wonders with his moment and Dennis Quilley plays hisItalian as if this was a silent movie. Martin Balsam is always fun towatch, no matter the accent. Richard Widmark is splendid in hisvillainy and Jean Pierre Cassel very moving indeed. The only weak spotin the cast is Michael York. Totally unbelievable. I suspect that"Murder in The Orient Express" 33 years old already, will continuedelighting audiences for years to come.
