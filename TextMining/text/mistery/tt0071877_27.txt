Murder on the Orient Express is definitely one of my favorite filmsever. It has a lot of qualities that make it so, the acting, plot,cast, design, music, etc were all perfect. The book was very faithfulto the novel, and the cast was absolutely magical! I don't think I haveever seen a movie with such a cast (Bacall, Bergman, Connery, Perkins,all of them). My personal favorite scene was when the revelation of howall of them killed Ratchett. The acting (especially Bacall) wasspot-on. Bergman's Little Brown Babies scene was hilarious andwell-acted. And I also found Wendy Hiller, who played PrincessDragomiroff, quite funny and played her part well. However, I did notmuch care for Finney's Poirot, I much prefer Ustinov's (and of courseSuchet is the best). Out of the Agatha Christine films, this is a closesecond to Death on the Nile (my favorite). The score by Richard RodneyBennet is one of the best film scores I have ever heard. The OrientExpress Walzer was my favorite. I also loved the opening scene whereRatchett kidnaps Daisy; the music was great as well. All in all, thefilm was stunning, and is definitely a classic (though an underratedone, I must say).
