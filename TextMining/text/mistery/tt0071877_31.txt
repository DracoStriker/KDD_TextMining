I had been wanting to see this movie for a while, and as it turns out, I wasreally impressed by this movie.  This is an enjoyable, intriguing murdermystery movie.  The performances were terrific.  Albert Finney was hilariousas Hercule Poirot.  Lauren Bacall was perfect as the talkative Americancharacter, Mrs. Hubbard.  Wendy Hiller was fantastic as the black-clad agingRussian princess; I got a kick out of her accent....and her appearance--shelooked like a gothic zombie who arose from the dead.  Tony Perkins wasinteresting to watch, playing another eccentric, fidgeting  character.  And,I definitely could not picture anyone else in Jacqueline Bisset'srole....anyone nearly as beautiful as she looked--she looked absolutelygorgeous in this movie.  However, I didn't see a need for all of the famousfaces.  Most of the characters had very little screen time.  This moviecould've been just fine with lesser-known actors or even unknowns playingsome of the characters.  I could easily picture lesser-known actors in theroles of the characters played by Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, and JohnGielgud.  Ingrid Bergman's performance was good but not great, and I wishher character would've been given more to do in the movie.  In fact, I wishALL of the characters would've been given more to do, so that way one couldknow the characters better.  I guess that in just two hours you can't get toknow very much about so many characters.  Nevertheless, I liked this movie alot.  I especially liked the setting, aboard the famous OrientExpress.
