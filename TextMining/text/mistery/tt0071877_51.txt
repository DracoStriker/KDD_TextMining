"Murder on the Orient Express" is a classy film, in so many ways. Withan an intriguing plot, based on one of Agatha Christie's best works, ithas wonderful settings and costumes, beautiful cinematography, a greatscore and of course, one of the most AMAZING casts ever. While IngridBergman's Academy Award winning performance doesn't impress me thatmuch, Finney plays a perfect Poirot (in my opinion much better thanPeter Ustinov's) and the rest of the cast create many unforgettablecharacters as well. My personal favourites are Wendy Hiller as creepyprincess Dragomiroff, Martin Balsam as delightful Italian signorBianchi, and Lauren Bacall, who's BIG fun in this. Fine work also fromsir John Gielgud, Anthony Perkins and Jean-Pierre Cassel; Sean Conneryis remarkably sexy as colonel Arbuthnot. With such a cast this film isreally, as its tag line states, "The Who's Who in the Whodunnit!". Itoffers a good deal of suspense, but also lots of humor, and more, agreat, great ending. Even Agatha Christie was completely satisfied withthis adaptation of her book, and I am too. My rating is 8/10.
