The great director Sidney Lumet was at the top of his game in 1974;with more than two decades in the business under his belt, he hadalready given us the classic gem 12 ANGRY MEN and the film version ofEugene O'Neill's LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT, which many critics feelcontains Katharine Hepburn's greatest performance, FAIL-SAFE, THEGROUP, and SERPICO, establishing himself in the process as one of thegreat cinematic voices of his generation. DOG DAY AFTERNOON was stillin the future when Lumet decided to take on lighter fare: the filmversion of one of Agatha Christie's most popular novels, MURDER ON THEORIENT EXPRESS.The material may have been lightweight compared to what he was used to(A friend of mine always refers to an Agatha Christie as a "jolly goodmurder"), but it was not without its challenges. Set on theworld-famous Orient Express, a luxury train that used to run fromIstanbul to Paris, Christie's dandyish Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot(Albert Finney) is shoe-horned into an unexpectedly full Wagon-Lit car(it is full in the off-season, the film's first red flag). With Poiroton board, we know what we're in for, and it isn't long before itstarts.Lumet had a formidable task on his hands; despite the light tone of thematerial, the stage set was even more claustrophobic than the jury roomin 12 ANGRY MEN, and he had to cram roughly the same number of actorsinto it. There are actually two sets: the sleeping car where thecompartments are, and the dining car, where most of the action takesplace.I'll keep it brief: first night out, the train runs into a snowdrift inthe Balkans and cannot proceed until the next station realizes it hasnot arrived and sends help. With nothing better to do, the charactershave breakfast and chatter about this and that. Christie tended to drawher characters with broad strokes, which is often an invitation toactors to overact, and yet when they do, somehow it works.Breakfast is barely over when it is discovered that an American who hadoffered Poirot a lot of money to be his bodyguard the night before hasbeen murdered in his bed in the night. With nothing better to do,Poirot gives in to the pleadings of his friend Bianchi (Martin Balsam),a director of the railway company who fears a police scandal, and takesthe case.What follows is possibly the most fascinating series of interviews everput on film. Clues have been strewn all over the dead man'scompartment, which alert's Poirot's sensitive nose that something is up(Finney is hilarious when he asks Balsam and George Coulouris, whoplays a doctor, if they've noticed that "there are too many clooos inthis room??"). Worse yet, the clues point all over the place but alllead to dead ends. Of course, by the end Poirot figures it all out (andif you watch this one carefully you will too) and a grand time is hadby all.Lumet is aided and abetted by a terrific screenplay by Paul Dehn and anincredible cast of international stars ranging from Finney to LaurenBacall as a loud and irritating American woman to Sean Connery as aColonel in the Indian Army to Wendy Hiller as a Russian Princess toAnthony Perkins playing yet another variation on Norman Bates (but no,he's not crazy here, just a bit neurotic) to Vanessa Redgrave as aprivate secretary/governess to Ingrid Bergman in a sensationalperformance as a Swedish missionary (Bergman would win her third Oscarfor this, delivering a memorable acceptance speech in which sheapologized to Italian actress Valentina Cortese, who had been the frontrunner for DAY FOR NIGHT).Yet it is Finney who draws the viewer's attention. Already of less thanaverage height at 5' 9", he makes himself smaller to play the manalways referred to in the novels as "the little Belgian." I won't vouchfor the authenticity of his accent; he does not exactly sound Belgian,but he does sound foreign, and the rest of his performance is goodenough to be considered the definitive Poirot (my apologies to DavidSuchet, who is as British as Finney and whom I never believed asPoirot); he keeps the viewer entertained with the character's manyeccentricities.Christie wrote a lot of these"about-a-dozen-characters-assembled-for-a-murder" types of yarns: Ihighly recommend watching this one back to back with AND THEN THEREWERE NONE (dir Rene Clair, 1945).Murder is never quite so much fun as when Christie does it.
