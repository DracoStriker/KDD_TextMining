Albert Finney is one of the greatest of English screen actors,achieving the ability to be different in every role he plays: ArthurSeaton, Tom Jones, Scrooge, 'Sir' (in THE DRESSER), Winston Churchill.His Hercule Piorot in 1974 earned him an Oscar nomination as BestActor, though it's a far more shouty and loud performance (completedwith oily black hair and rich Belgian accent) than subsequentinterpretations of the role by Peter Ustinov and David Suchet.When Sidney Lumet's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS appeared in Britishand American cinemas at the end of 1974,audiences were not yetaccustomed to the numerous Agatha Christie adaptations which are nowpart of ITV peak-time schedule. The film must have seemed fresh andsparkling and different in a cinematic landscape filled that year withdisaster movies, cop thrillers and sex comedies. Here was a British-made film bursting with movie stars (Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery,Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Jacquline Bisset,Anthony Perkins etc) all cast as various American and European murdersuspects marooned a snow-bound Orient Express somewhere in the Balkansin 1935. Poirot - another traveller on the train - has to deduce whichof them knifed multi-millionaire gangster Rachett (Widmark) to death. The film is technically very impressive.It has a fondness for thepeople, look and manners of the 1930s. Geoffrey Unsworth makesmarvellous use of light and colour in a confined setting. Tony Walton'scostumes have an exaggerated 1930s chic. Richard Rodney Bennett's musicscore is as lush as a Viennese waltz. Their contribution is in everyscene. Paul Dehn's screenplay is packed with good dialogue and makes arelatively claustrophobic mystery highly watchable, especially whenmuch of the second half comprises of Poirot interviewing suspects.The follow-up in 1978 - DEATH ON THE NILE - is even better.
