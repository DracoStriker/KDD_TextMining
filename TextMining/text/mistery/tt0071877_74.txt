There have never been so many suspects in a single Agatha Christiebook. In this movie version, the inimitable Albert Finney plays HerculePoirot, who is aboard the Orient Express, coming from Istanbul. Amysterious man wants to enlist Poirot's help because he fears he is indanger. Later, that man is murdered, stabbed numerous times. A wholehost of passengers are logical suspects and it's up to Poirot to sortthrough the details of the murder. There was no love loss for this guybecause he was one really bad dude. The book and the movie are classicsin that every time a character seems to be the one who did it, a cluewould be found to dismiss the speculation. Since I want anyone who hasnot seen this to get the same kick I did, I won't say any more. Theresult of this is different than any mystery I've read or seen.
