An absolutely stellar cast (Widmark joined the film solely to meet theother actors)is the perfect complement to a film loaded with old schoolHollywood glamour. It follows the book's storyline - spoiler - a seriesof people impacted by a Lindbergh baby esquire murder and ensuing chaosenact a complicated revenge on the man responsible - very well, twoexceptions being in character differences to the literary counterpartsof Bianchi and Beddoes("Mr. Beddoes," as he insists), and with a minortweaking to Mrs. Hubbard, who is actually better in the film as antwice wed natural acerbic instead of a smothering mom. Poirot does oneof his rare about faces in this story, concluding that justice was donebetter through his silence. Agatha Christie liked to leave all herhints in the open before the murder(s) was solved. That is the only,unfortunate real problem here. Clues which were subtle in the book arepainfully obvious in the film. Persons cringing at Poirot's presence,the shifty eyes, and the worst -a moment where Poirot is made to thinkthe victim is crying out (thus changing the time of death)by one of hismurderers. Its a crucial clue lost by its so obviously not beingWidmark's voice. But looking past that it is a fine and fittingadaptation, especially the murder scene itself and a touching endingwhere a self made family toasts in relief.
