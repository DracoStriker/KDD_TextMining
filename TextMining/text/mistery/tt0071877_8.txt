That Poirot. Always a beacon for dreadful things which happen justwithin earshot, and only he up to the task of solving them. If only hecould get a break and take off to some far-away land and relax from theevils that men do.But Agatha Christie has other things in hand. On a trip between Parisand Istanbul, something quite horrible happens to another passenger,one Mr. Ratchett, a man who has been suspected to have been themastermind behind the Lindbergh baby incident in which she waskidnapped and killed. It would be up to the local authorities to comeand intervene, but a snowstorm has stalled the train midway and Poirothas to locate the killer.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is drenched in style and reminds me ofGOSFORD PARK, its much younger cousin. When a movie has so much actingand overacting and actors of such stature such comparisons will not beoverlooked, but this story has a lot more up its sleeve which I won'treveal for those who haven't seen it. Suffice it be to say that thenames alone (while in later years did not guarantee a good film, herethey do) are of this caliber: Lauren Bacall, Albert Finney (as Poirot),Ingrid Bergmann (who won an Oscar, her third, for Best SupportingActress), Sean Connery, Anthony Perkins, Jacqueline Bisset, VanessaRedgrave, Sir John Gielgud, Martin Balsam, Richard Widmark, MichaelYork, Wendy Hiller, Jean-Pierre Cassel, George Coulouris, and RachelRoberts.Boasting one of the most riveting monologues ever committed on film,MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS remains one of the more sumptuous AgathaChristie whodunits and is another strong (if atypical) film in veteranfilm director Sidney Lumet's career.
