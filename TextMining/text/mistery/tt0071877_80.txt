This movie is like a big happy dessert to be tucked into after dinner. Thesettings, the costumes, the color added by having such differentnationalities, the safety of the past... it's hard not to fall happily intosuch lush surroundings.Those who dislike the movie seem to do so only by comparison with AgathaChristie's books or other adaptations. E.g., "this isn't the real Poirot!".Well, it doesn't matter to me if this is the real Poirot - if one takes themovie on its own, it's just wonderful. **** SPOILERS **** The only criticism that I can think of is the very beginning showing thekidnapping of the Armstrong baby. Why show this at the beginning? Itdestroys too much of the suspense. Obviously we know the movie must relateto that kidnapping or it would not have been shown. Why not save thesescenes for the point after they decipher the burnt note?**** SPOILERS END **** It's a lovely confection - big and fluffy and with some remarkableperformances - Gielgud has been a butler so many times that we fail tonotice how fine he is at it; Bergman is just remarkable; Connery is fun towatch - and so is Rachel Roberts. I find Vanessa Redgrave's face radiant inmany movies - incredibly warm and appealing. I'd never seen Bisset put on aforeign accent before (well, except her French) and found her verybelievable. York was good, so were the lesser characters - e.g., Colourisand Quilley. I find Bacall's character irritating - though of course that'sthe point. Wendy Hiller as the Princess was wonderful - and finally Finneywas well, extraordinaire.See it - you'll have fun.
