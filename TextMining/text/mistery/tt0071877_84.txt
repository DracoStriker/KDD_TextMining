"Murder on the Orient Express" is one of those rare, interesting films thatonly pop up once in a while. First and foremost I must say that when I sawthis movie for the first time I wasn't very impressed by neither AlbertFinney's Oscar nominated performance or Sidney Lumet's directing. But afterthinking about it for a while, I realized that it was actually incredible.Tony Perkins is brilliant as ever, and the rest of the cast is just as good.Ingrid Bergman especially, she's fantastic. As I said before, there's notmuch to be said for Albert Finney. He's just not Hercule Poirot. Poirot wasa gentle, soft man. Finney can't match this. If you're really looking for athrill, read the book, you won't be sorry!
