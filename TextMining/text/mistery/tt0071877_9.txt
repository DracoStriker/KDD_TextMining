An all star cast aboard a luxuary train are questioned and suspected of amurder when one of the passengers who was already fearing for his life isfound dead and all this seems to be releated to a child that was kidnappedand murdered years earlier. Exceptionally done thriller is a homage to the mysteries of Hollywood'sgolden age with fun and brilliantly done performances from a seasoned cast,but Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, and an unreconizable Albert Finney reallystand out. Magnaficent score, sets, costumes, color schemes, dialogue, and afine eye for detail just add to the fun. Never a dull or boring moment; thefinale is really, really good. I just love everything about this film. Veryhighly recommanded film is in my top 10 films of the 70's and is in my top100 films of all time.
