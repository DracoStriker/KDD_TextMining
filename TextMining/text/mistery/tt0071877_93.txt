The Murder On the Orient Express is a very captivating and dramaticmovie and it is one of those few movies that is a good adaptation of awork produced by a prolific author such as Agatha Christie.The movie is a smooth flowing movie and it is a must watch for thosemovie-goers who appreciate the movie for its fineness and crispness.Movie-goers who like to watch movies that demand the viewers paying afair amount of attention to subtle details or dialogues will surelyfind the movie interesting.Here I would also like to comment on the cast. The cast is amazing andevery person involved has done his or her part with finesse. The plotis very good and the movie flows very smoothly. However, the actors aresporting accents based on their national backgrounds. For instance, thelead character of Poirot would sport a strong Belgian accent. Theseaccents may cause a little difficulty for non-seasoned movie watchersto struggle with understanding of vital dialogues and hence a DVD withsubtitles would be useful.Direction, costumes, story, plot, acting and all other elements aredealt with very finely in this movie and this one can surely be ratedas a classic.Highly recommended from my side. Cheers.
