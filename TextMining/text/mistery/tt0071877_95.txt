I'm shocked by the people who don't like this movie or suggest thatDeath on the Nile (inferior in every way) and Evil Under the Sun (trulycampy and bad) are better films. To say that Finney is bad in the part(despite his Oscar nomination) is to miss the whole point. He isbrilliant as Poirot. He commands the screen in every scene,particularly during the explanation of the crime. It is wonderfullydirected by Lumet in a stylistic, effective way other Christie filmstotally lack. The script is the real gem, reducing the complicatedstory into a comprehensible and fascinating crime investigation withthe best exposition of a crime in any detective story movie. The castplays their parts perfectly, creating instantly recognized types thatare endlessly entertaining and word perfect. The script's witty and allthe cast handle the dialogue wonderfully. This movie is an homage toChristie and to the 1930s and is (along with Witness for theProsecution) the best of Christie adaptations.
