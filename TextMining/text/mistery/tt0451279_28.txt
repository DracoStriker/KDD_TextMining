This movie was average, at best. Really poor acting on Gal Gadots part.The story was very predictable, CGI was poor, and the story was phonedin. I really couldn't care less about any of the characters, and thereactions were incredible illogical. I had hope with a twist at the endthat it would get better, but once again, it just fell flat.
