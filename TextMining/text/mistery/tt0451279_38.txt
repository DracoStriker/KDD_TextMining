I don't get why this movie is rated this good. It was writtenincredibly lazy. The characters were boring as hell or so generic thatyou didn't even remember them being in the movie 5 minutes after youleft the cinema. The Villain was just there because you kinda need avillain that could be fought in the end. The Action looked sterile andunderwhelming. There are so many plot holes and illogical actions, thatyou loose count. And the worst thing overall might be the last scene."And then i learned, that only love can stop war"......are you freakingkidding me????? Did an 3-year-old write this? Reading all the reviewshere leaves me with 3 theories.Theory 1: Everybody that gave that movie 10 Stars and calls it the bestSuperhero-Movie ever has never seen any movie in their entire life.Theory 2: On 2 out of 3 Cinema-Tickets was a highly effective poisonthat made the audience hallucinate a better movie.Theory 3: political correctness and gender-madness has gone so far,that nobody dares to criticize the movie because it is (sarcasm on)such an important movie for gender-quality (sarcasm off)
