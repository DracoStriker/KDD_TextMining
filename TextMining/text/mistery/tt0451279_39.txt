All those ratings have got to be fake. I can and will not believe thatmost people ACTUALLY thought this movie was good. It took literally until one hour and 14 minutes, half way through thewhole film, to FINALLY get some action sequences that are longer than 5seconds! Everything beforehand is boring preparation garbage and stupiddialogues by uninteresting, cliché characters nobody cares about mixedwith some dad-jokes even immature teenagers would heartily yawn at.The end was also really, really cheesy, completely "ex machina" andbad... seriously, who wrote this crap?Compared to other action hero flicks this falls super flat on allfronts: Uninspired story and antagonists, far too little action, toomuch blabbering and cringey PEGI-13 fillers and jokes.2/10, this movie is utter trash so don't waste your time.
