For a movie with such a strong feminist message they could have atleast hired female stunt actors. Honestly, the overuse of CGI in thisfilm was not only embarrassing, but it is so technically awful that itmakes 80's green screen tech look realistic.As for the generous reviews and upvotes of this movie, we just have tounderstand that these days marketing budgets not only pay for positive-reviews, but they also pay click-farms.
