I guess all the really bad Germans have been exhaustively & nowboringly used up one to many times,beat dragged & tortured in theprevious thousand turkey shoot WW2 movies from the Longest Day toInglourious Basterds ... maybe having an Israeli IDF glamour girlpummel the last surviving movie Nazis seems rather unsportsmanlike.So now we have fresh meat Germans from WW1 that just aren't as Kosheras the WW2 bad-ass Nazi robotrons . It just doesn't come across as thegood fight,IDF Wonder Woman against the exhausted muddy trench fighting& dying Germans of the Kaiser's Army. Wonder Woman defending the hugeBritish Imperialist Empire against the upstart smaller GermanImperialist Empire. What Empire should I root for?So duel citizenship Wonder Woman kicks Kaiser Sheev Palpatine Admiralsright of the bridge off the first Allegiance-class Star Destroyer shecrosses paths with...ops, wrong universe ... kicking Kaisers Wilhelm'spoison gas snorting quasi-Nazis off the bridge of the nearest Zeppelinso the smaller Axis of Evil Ottoman Empire can be carved up & therighteous State of Israel formed on the back of the defeated Turkishsubjects thanks to Wonder Woman!Well...basically that is the historical time-line.Hollywood writers wet dream rewrite of history since they now havepicked clean the dried carcass of WW2 & can finally move on,but thesidekick American Hero going futuristic suicidal jihadi just doesn'tbode well for gentlemanly slaughter of 1914. Lawrence of Arabia versusWonder Woman might be in the works with smart-ass Shia LaBeouf asCaptain Lawrence.Maybe I'm reading to much in this generic CGI feast on the eyes.but Ihave to as this endless stream of Marvel/DC comic green screen moviesare blurring into each other .Now the original corny T.V Carter alwaysseemed like an awkward top heavy super hero gal but Gal Gadot comesacross as a sweaty Stairmaster extra & just as talented as a 10lbDumbbell.
