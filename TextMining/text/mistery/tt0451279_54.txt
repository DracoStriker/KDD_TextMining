Wonder Woman received lots of praise when it first came out eitherbecause it was the only DCEU film that wasn't completely abysmal orbecause it had a female lead. I don't care about male or female leads,I just want to watch a good film. So does Wonder Woman fill that duty?No. Is it horrible? Also no. It has serviceable action and a decentscore. But beyond that? Nothing holds up, the story is basic andpredictable. The two leads, Steve Trevor and Diana are the onlypassable characters, every other character was forgotten as soon as thecredits rolled. Every film needs a character arc. The character has tochange or learn something. In Wonder Woman they lay it out perfectly,Diana will learn that things aren't as black and white as she thinks,she'll learn that evil is within everyone. Just as they are on the cuspof achieving a successful character arc they blow it all away so thatthey could cram in a ten-minute cesspool of CGI and stupid action.Nearly $150,000,000 was spent making this film, but they miss thefundamentals of story telling? Warner Bros. should've quit while theywere ahead after The Dark Knight Rises.
