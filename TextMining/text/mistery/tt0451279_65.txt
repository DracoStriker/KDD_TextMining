To start with, I do enjoy the other DCEU movies. I loved Man of Steel,liked Batman V. Superman, and thought Suicide Squad was "okay." WonderWoman is another one added to the DCEU that I would say I "liked".Some of the good things about Wonder Woman:1. The humor. There are good touches of humor here without making ittoo corny (Marvel is an expert at the corny humor).2. The romance. I appreciated that there was some of that in here andthe relationship with Steve Trevor is what shaped Wonder Woman.3. The action. I am not going to lie, Wonder Woman kicks butt. Overall, this is a good movie. The editing is also not all over theplace, which is a problem for all of the other DCEU movies. If I had torank this movie, I would say it ranks like this for me:Man of Steel Wonder Woman Batman V. Superman Justice League SuicideSquadI do rank Man of Steel ahead because that is a personal favorite.
