Let mes start off by saying that I am not usually a big fan ofsuperhero movies. They're all pretty much the same to me: some supervillain threatens the whole world, the superhero tries to save the day,there's a huge, at least 20 minute long fight scene at the climax ofthe film, and then it's over. Wonder Woman isn't that far off fromthis, but I found it to be entertaining, well directed, and wellrounded. Gal Gadot was great as Wonder Woman, and Chris Pine was goodtoo. The death of his character was done well and had nice emotionalpayoff. The story moved along at a good pace and had a few greatmoments of character development thrown in as well. The cinematographywas very good, as was the score.While Wonder Woman isn't amazing, it's a solid film that'sentertaining, well made, and that has a good story to it as well aswell rounded characters. 7.5 out of 10
