OK Wonder Woman review time ***Spoilers ahead***The first half of the movie was sooooo slow I had to literally hold myeyes open to prevent me from falling asleep so im not gonna talk aboutit. Now correct me if im wrong but this was billed as a "summer actionmovie" correct? Well when its 2:10 mins and only about 15-20 mins isactual action I have a problem with that. Don't get me wrong when shewas all kickin ass and whatnot it was awesome and I dug that part alot, thats why its saddening to me there was so little. Also on theplus side the chemistry with her and Steve was good ... so of course hedies lol. (sidenote he would have made a good Green Lantern with thechemistry they showed) On the down side, once again a very slow movietill the bunker scene (which was bad ass) and then nothing again tillthe final fight which again there was no real Villain presence till thelast 10 mins and even then she spent half of that time fightingmustache man Ares and not God of war Ares and as we all know for me thevillain makes the movie. I give it a 3/10 its not bad like GhostRider/Fantastic Four bad its just not what I expected or hoped for atall.
