Superhero movies are my guilty pleasures. As long as they are not DC!This movie is a sleeping pill (it really feels like it is going onforever) with extremely bad CGI and over-use of either slow motion orspeed up effects to try to make up for the tatty computer work. Thestart of the movie, with young Diana watching the Amazons training,gives a clue to how bad the CGI is. And the poor quality runsthroughout the film. Films in the 90s made it better! The acting is unconvincing from most of the actors unfortunately, andhuge plot holes leave you shaking your head over this 2hr20minnonsense. So, my verdict? Just don't bother! If you like this sort of stuff, doyourself a favour and re-watch something from Marvel. It is beyond mehow DC is failing massively yet again to deliver a watchable movie. Ihave seen most from Marvel quite a few times, they are entertaining andthe CGI is stunning! When it comes to WW, I could hardly get through itthe 1st time around. The thought of walking out on the movie halfwaythrough, exited me more than the movie itself.
