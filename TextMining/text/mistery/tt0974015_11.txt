Funny that at least half of these positive reviews were made by aweek-old,fresh accounts.These "fans" will always get mediocre movies aslong as they protect them.Anyway,this is the 4th time ofDCappointment.(w.woman was good). DC has officially become MCU 2.0.DCfans are criticizing MCU movies for obvious reasons.Yet they praiseJ.league even though it is just like a typical marvel/MCU movie. DC hasbecome the very thing that DC fans hate and criticized over years.Villain was so weak,flash and aquaman were cringe(especiallyflash),pacing was so fast. The comedy was so forced and jokes were badplaced. Some people thought that they should make flash,cyborg,aquamansolo movies before the JL in order to develop the characters.And thosepeople were absolutely correct.Those 3 characters really lacksdevelopment. DC is still making tons of mistakes in movie industry.Ithink they really need to reconsider the future of dc movies.
