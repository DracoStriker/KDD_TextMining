Well, once again we have the generic, boilerplate, superhero teamflick. Team spends the first part of the movie unable to be a team.Then they finally and miraculously get it together just in time tofight the latest unstoppable big bad, who plans to destroy thecity/country/continent/planet/galaxy/universe. I'm Shocked! Shocked I Say, that they pull together and pull thoughjust enough and we find out the city/country/continent/planet/galaxy/universe is safe until the next, evenbigger bad, who is waiting their turn patiently to rain downdestruction when the next installment drops in two years.At least this episode had a few obviously Whedonesque quipisms to dropinto the tedium between the deadly dull plodding throughline ZackSnyder had deathmarched the audience into, but it was not enough tosave us or the movie. I honestly felt like some of our protagonistsshould have been checking their watches an hour into the movie andasking, "Can we go beat the bad guy already?" I am tired of this movie. I was tired of this movie when I saw thismovie three movies ago.
