I just cant begin to tell you how amazing this movie was ! There areparts where you go like uhhhh okay, the villain is strong & mercilessbut i would have liked a little backstory to him just like with Zod.Moreover I could sense there are parts of it cut out and they will maketheir way into an unlimited 3 hour version of the movie but thetransition between characters and the action sequences are amazing. Ilove how DC has got their act together since Wonder Woman and injectedsome well placed humor in there. Its not light but its not too darkeither. I wouldn't say anything about Superman's return except that itsa stroke of absolute genius and I couldn't have asked for a betterentry. To sum it up! DC is on the right track now and yeah there aretwo post credit scenes that will make your wildest dreams come true.You are gonna have fun!
