"Justice League" is a pointless flail of expensive (yet somehowcheap-looking) CGI that no amount of tacked-on quips, or even Gadot'sluminescent star power, can rescue.Like Cyborg (Ray Fisher), one of its ostensible heroes, "JusticeLeague" is patched together from disparate elements. Original directorZack Snyder ("Batman v. Superman") left partway through due to a deathin the family, leaving Joss Whedon ("The Avengers") to finish up. Theresult? All the plodding, gray, generic action of a Snyder film withstabs of Whedonian humor that almost never feel organic. There's nosense of purpose here, not even a sense of place.
