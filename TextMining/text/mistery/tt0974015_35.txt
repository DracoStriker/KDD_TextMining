I remember that day, a few months ago when the trailer for this cameout. The fanboy in me literally screamed and danced around the entirehouse. Fast forward to yesterday when i finally saw it. Zero characterdevelopment, a laughable steppenwolf, and a movie which just lookedlike cut scenes from an injustice game sums up this 2 hour disaster.Wonder woman is perhaps the only saving grace, and even that is becauseof the brilliance of Gadot. Do yourself a favor and skip this one,you'll save time, money, and your hopes will not get shattered into amillion pieces like mine did.
