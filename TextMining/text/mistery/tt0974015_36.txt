Justice league is up with transformers 5 as the worst movie I've seenall year.This movies should be an example of what can go wrong when you get 2writers with different ideas, and two directors with two vastlydifferent styles that don't blend at all.The movie is paced horribly. The first 40 minutes is literally justCharacter introductions.Speaking of the Characters, they are just bad.Flash is annoying. Aqua man is like a 40 year old hot topic managertrying to be cool. cyborg is just a bad actor. Ben Affleck just doesn'tcare. Wonder Woman was just okay. And Superman was just bad. he hadthis weird uncanny-valley face. The CGI was absolutely terrible.The movie was mostly boring and/or cringey.No joke lands.Overall DC just needs to start over with this universe. They've had 5 duds in a row, and it doesn't look to get any better soon.
