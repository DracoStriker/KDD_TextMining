*minor SPOILERS*Usually I give movies a solid 5 on the start, meaning that the movie isaverage, but this.... was a bummer.The plot line is messy, sequences and scenes are just happening withoutany order. Moreover, the character development and buildup isdisappointing. The Villlan in this movie is exactly the same as in theWonder woman, weird, not meaningful...it is just there.Jason Momoa kicked ass though, and there were a few moments, where themovie wasn't boring, but man....some scenes make you just look at yourwatch and check the time. Overall lack of chemistry between characters,and I was so excited to see the movie. The flash character is just toomuch cringy*hey-look-at-me-I'm-a-socially-awkward guy". He's basicallythe spiderman of DC universe...In general, if you really want to see the movie, don't waste yourmoney, wait until it comes out on netflix.
