You know what, I don't disagree with all the bad reviews for JusticeLeague, but it's still okay anyway. The way I see it is this: youremember the old, iconic theme music that Batman and Superman had? Thebest themes, Danny Elfman's and John Williams', from the 80s and 90s.Well in Justice League they are used again BUT... neither of them areplayed in their entirety. You hear a slight snippet, literally a barelyrecognisable snippet, buried underneath other noise, but they neverjust play it. You never get that rousing, exciting, recognisablemoment. And the whole film is like that. The actors are all great, butthe script gives none of them a standout moment. There's no jeopardy orrisk. Just big empty CGI-scapes. The superheroes don't worry abouttheir alter egos or hidden identities, removing all the fun. They don'trescue civilians or do anything clever, just exist in a computergenerated world. And the CGI is dodgy, really very dodgy in places (ifyou've seen it, you'll know what I mean). It makes you long forChristopher Reeve or Michael Keaton or Christian Bale, not because thenew actors aren't good but because those old stories had heart. EvenWonder Woman doesn't get a chance to shine here, all her innocence andstrength of character (and talk of men because "just and wise" etc) aresucked out in favour of bland chat and upskirt shots. So that's it,Justice League. I'm glad I saw it, I'm also sort of glad it's over.I'll probably get it on DVD at some point, and I'll probably watch itonce or twice.
