From the begging to the end I truly enjoyed this movie. The film hasgotten negative or mixed reviews but please, do not let that stop youfrom going to the movies, grabbing a large bucket of popcorn, a massivecup of soda, and enjoying the hell out of this film. Ezra miller to meis a star in this film. He's super enjoyable, he has so much heart andyou can tell he had a great time making this film. Ben affleck owns theroll of Batman. He's fantastic. Gal Gadot is brilliant as Wonder Woman.She really is the character. Jason freaking mamoa is a damn stud. Heturned the most laughable character into a complete bad ass. His aquaman works and I can't wait to see him in his own film. This is by farthe best Superman you are going to see in the current DCEU. He's reallymaking the character his own. He's a good Superman. Just lovable. Story wise the movie does have an issue with pacing, but they arecramming a lot in 2 hours. Wish they would have given some scenes a fewmore seconds but I know they had obligations. Action in this movie was insanely cool. Watching the flash enter thespeed force was IN SANE! All in all watching the team come together andkick some ass was great. The battle between the worlds in the beggingwas so bad ass. Loved it so damn much. Do yourself a huge favor. See this film!
