First of all, I'm a huge DC fanboy and I was so excited to wait towatch the movie as soon as it on air. So after 2hs watching the movie,I have to say that I'm so disappointed with this JL movie.Even I'm a fan who read the comic and watched all the cartoon of JL,none of them can make me feel this worse than this movie. Everythingwas a mess, Batman was like an emotional girl and Superman was like ateenager with the superpower who can kill the boss with one punch.I doubt that WB made the Production team cut so many scenes of the themovie like what they did on BvS before.Now I will wait and watch again this movie in HD if they have an"uncut" one. But if they really have one, I will have to say this toWB: "shame, shame of you WB, don't do sh*t with DC anymore and we wantjustice for Justice League"
