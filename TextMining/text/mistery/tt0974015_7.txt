Its the same old story when it come to films. Critics demolish a filmand people who are interested to watch it don't and end up watching itillegally then realizing it was amazing. I experienced this when greatreviews came out for guardians of the galaxy 2, I went to watch it andhated it. I enjoyed this film personally but don't take my word for itgo watch it for your self. The movie brings together what we all hopedfor, a team. its fun, bright and energetic with a balance ofseriousness.A piece of advice don't go into this movie expecting to watch a movieon the level of the dark knight. In my opinion the only film to everget close to that was the dark knight rises. As for the DC cinematicuniverse expect an array of bright movies the next possible dark movieyou'll get is probably THE BATMAN.
