Just came from the Cinema and got this awful feeling in my body. Thatfeeling you have when your girlfriend breaks up with you, or you have abig hangover but nothing to eat in the fridge..This movie is the sad future of hollywoods big super hero franchises. Iactually kind of liked Batman V Superman, and I was chocked by the lasttrailer that came out. I thought it looked weird and bad, and mythought became real..I have no idea how a movie like this, gets screened in front of anaudience, and then approved to hit cinemas world wide. People don'thave any standards anymore, and it seems like it's just a CGI-race forthe producers. They even made my favorite superhero useless. In Superman V Batman,they actually destroyed my fears, and made Batman Badass! He had acouple of scenes where he shined. Like when he saves Supermans mother,and he just goes apes**t on those badguys. THAT IS WHAT THE AUDIENCEWANNA SEE!however, the movie had one of the worst endings I've seen in a movie ina loong time. The bad Zack Snyder greenscreen/CG-hell turned out tomake the movie worse instead of better. Zack Snyder can't make a goodclimax for his movies.I think the guy needs a break away from Hollywood for a long time. Theman has showed us he can make good movies, but the cgi environments wethought and loved as art, (like in SinCity and 300) turnes out to bejust a getaway from what we actually love about movies. That we canrelate to them, and make us disappear into a world where everything canbecome real. But the 60 mins CGI show, just turnes out to be a bad, notwell done, gimmick. STOP ruin our beloved childhood heroes while you still can.. This moviewas AWFUL!
