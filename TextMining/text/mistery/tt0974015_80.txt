This movie is a two hour long visual orgy with absolutely no storybehind it. You could write all of it down on a napkin with a bluntcrayon. The CGI is way overdone, the physics ridiculous - just like inWonder Woman -, the action gets boring fast, and since there is nostory, there are no plot twists, no surprises, no characterdevelopment, nothing. Just CGI characters fighting different CGIcharacters in a predictable succession of different scenes, the end.This movie is missing three quarters of what make a movie a movie andthe last quarter is not without its own faults, as aforementioned. Inshort, it's a complete fail.
