Amazing Experience! I felt the movie good have been a bit more longerto give space to the heroes to build their backstories. But thanks tothe WB mandate of keeping the film within 2hours might have caused thebacklash. I would now definitely wait for the extended version.One takeaway from the film for me was Superman! He was great and thebest. He is the Superman we were all longing for. Even the mightiestSteppenwolf was no match for him.The other heroes did really well, the banters were fun. The movie canbe termed as a fun and the viewers will have a good time for sure.Looks like Joss Whedon have done a lot of tampering with theVisuals/Scenes which personally I am not happy but it works.Coming back to the scores of the critics, I am still not sure what theyare looking for in that movie. I feel the average ratings from them forall comic book movies should be 5 or 6 out of 10. As these flicks arecomic book entertainment and not serious drama oriented films. Weshould exclude The Dark Knight series and Spiderman 2. But overall, weshould not expect high scores from them. But to my surprise we see adis balance between the Marvel and DCEU scores. Not sure the reason butI sincerely feel its not the content. Coming back to the recommendation, you should watch the movie and Judgeby yourself. To me the movie is 7/10, I gave 10 in IMDb just to avoidthe score mismatch, because I see people intentionally giving badscores to bring down the overall rating.Verdict: Do watch and Judge by yourself and don't listen to the world!
