So after BvsS, I really did not hope much from this movie but wassurprised to see each and every scene and the action sequences which Ithink is the best of all superhero movies. Every single character is inplace and has delivered their best performances. This movie is beyondexpectations and has set a new record. I don't know why some people arenot liking this movie, but for me, it's the best action movie of alltime. The drawbacks of BvsS has been kept in mind and have beenexcellently overcome. Every character has been given attention to.Though the movie was fast that is not a bad thing after all. There isno dull moment in this movie. Thanks DC for making your fans proud!!!!
