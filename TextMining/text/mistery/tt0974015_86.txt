First off, I've enjoyed most of the "DC Films" so far. Snyder'sprevious two are solid 7s; some significant flaws and ham-fisteddirection, but I liked the ideas he was exploring and the overallexperiences enough to give both a positive review.While I'm still giving this movie a positive review, I'm disappointedthat Snyder wasn't able to fully deliver on what he set up in Man ofSteel and Batman v. Superman. Exploring where a superhuman alien fitsin the world and the effectiveness of different methods of heroismwasn't done as elegantly as it could have been in those movies, butthey were interesting nonetheless. Sure, there was some brooding andslower pacing, but the subjects were given room to breathe and thecharacters grew throughout the course of each movie. There's some ofthat here, but a lot of it is cut short (likely to keep the lengthdown).The action and "fun" that critics were clamoring for are definitelypresent here, though, and are done relatively well. I liked theinteractions between the heroes, even though some of the humor fallsflat. Unlike "The Avengers", all of the heroes feel like they serve apurpose here. There's no useless Hawkeye/Black Widow or cannon fodderQuicksilver here. Steppenwolf was simply a means to an end, so I canforgive him being so forgettable. I'd like to see more memorablevillains in some of their solo outings though. The CGI was (for themost part) better than the PS2 level CGI featured in the finales of BvSand WW. The Speed Force effect and Cyborg's projections looked great,but the finale here still looked off.For those that want a fun action movie, this'll do the job (even thoughit doesn't stand out much in a sea of ensemble blockbusters). For thosethat want a satisfying conclusion to this three movie arc, wait for theinevitable extended edition (which hopefully will give this movie someroom to breathe).
