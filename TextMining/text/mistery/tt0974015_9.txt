As both a Marvel and Dc fan, this movie exceed all of expectations.Such a great hype and action packed film. I loved every singlecharacter and how well they developed together. I would see this movie10 more times!! The only flaws I saw with the movie was some CGI buthey. Not every movie is perfect, the visuals were amazing and was justa epic movie to sit and watch and bring to life finally.
