Can't quite call myself a true fan of superhero movies, but I am fondof both Marvel and DC. To me, Justice League was a majordisappointment.For the past 5 years DC has been desperately trying to jump-start theiruniverse, while Marvel was already on a roll with no intention ofstopping. Although, it doesn't seem to work for DC. With the negativereviews of Batman v Superman, the burden of setting the DCEU on theright path has fallen to Justice League. It did set the universe on apath, but is it the right one, it remains to be seen. The simple factis that there's still that problem with a huge amount of action andpoor distribution of it.As for the characters... I can't yet come to terms of Ben Affleck beingthe Caped Crusader and Superman's appearance was just not impressiveenough. I found The Flash to be quite irritating and I'm indifferentwhen it comes to Cyborg.If you ask me, what could have been saved of the Justice League wassaved by Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and Jason Momoa as Aquaman. Also,some of the details in the battle scenes were spot on and so were someof the jokes (I repeat SOME).To sum up, I can say that Justice League is worth watching, but preparefor a certain feeling of missing something in the end. I can't put myfinger on it, but the ending just hits you out of the bloom, thereforesomething is left unsaid. It will be interesting to see the developmentof DCEU after Justice League, but I'm afraid it is headed nowhere.Let's hope I'm wrong.
