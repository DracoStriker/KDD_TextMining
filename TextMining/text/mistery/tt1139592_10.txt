I've been waiting for the release of this movie for years. I thoughtall this time they had been working on the film but from what I saw, itseems to me like they worked on it recently and for a short amount oftime because it was really bad and I'm a fan of the films. I loved thefirst two movies. It really gave me chills and I can always go back andwatch it again. This movie didn't scare a bit. There were just a fewpop ups that made me jump. The creeper is supposed to be a creature butin this film it looked more like a man in a mask. Also, originally, thecreeper wears all black but this creeper was wearing a red shirt and itnot scary. It makes it seem like the creeper has a wardrobe. The makeupwas terrible. Everyone was laughing. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY.The point of a horror film is that it is supposed to be scary. With allthe horror films nowadays, I feel like that's what their doing andthat's why it's not successful. M. Night knows what scary is.There was some parts that were okay but overall it was just a waste oftime. I had high expectations. I'm so disappointed.
