I waited 14 years to be disappointed. The acting was terrible, thestory lines were terrible, and the plot was inconsistent. Because ofthe time difference between when the second Creepers was filmed and thethird, everybody has aged especially the sheriff. It was obviously hehad on a wig and it made him look comical. Despite my disappointment Icontinue to be a Creepers' fan and hope that the fourth installmentmakes-up for the third.
