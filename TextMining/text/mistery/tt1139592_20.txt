Don't waste your time seeing this movie. The best part of the movie wasthe interview after the credits. The fact the movie was only releasedon 2 days and is premiering on TV within a month tells you how bad thisfilm is. For someone who enjoyed the first 2 films, I was shocked howbad this movie was. Stick with the first and the second movie, becausethis one will be a total let down!
