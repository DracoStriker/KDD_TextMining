I remember watching the first Jeepers Creepers and straight away wantedmore. Again a few years later with 2. Not with this. I found thecharacters unrelatable, unlikeable and boring (so much so I fastforwarded in places) IT IS THAT PREDICTABLE!!! Seriously, I'm sure theSYFY channel threw a few bucks at this to rush it out before Halloweenas an after thought. I heard a year or two back that another film wasin the making. SO DISAPPOINTING IT WAS CRINGWORTHY
