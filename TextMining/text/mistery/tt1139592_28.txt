Perhaps I'm very disappointed, because it was a movie sequel that Iwaiting impatiently and that I really wanted to see. Also, I must saythat I am the big fan of the Jeepers Creepers franchise. The storythroughout the movie is unconnected and boring. In same scene, there isdaylight in one movie frame and night in another (only few secondsapart)? Second mistake is the selection of the time-line. I don't thinkanyone is interested in what was happening between the first and secondmovie. Maybe I was disappointed so much because I expected sequel notprequel. In addition, I think that the audience would be much moreinterested in knowing what happened after the second part when theykilled Jeepers Creepers. Perhaps Salva choose that period for thirdpart because he wanted to make another one. However, regarding all thatwas happening with this movie release (all the protests and everything)I am sure that Salva will not shoot another Jeepers Creepers any timesoon. All that makes this movie total failure. I saw it once, and Idon't think I want to see it again.
