Jeepers Creepers 3 is less of a movie and more of a prolonged bowelmovement. Production wasn't delayed, it was 14 years of cinematicconstipation, but unfortunately, they finally crapped out a pitiful,useless end to the Jeepers Creepers saga. Ironically, the budget wasprobably less than a roll of toilet paper. Also, for the record, I am adie-hard fan of the first two films and I promise you I went into part3 determined to like it, despite the garbage trailers and negativeonline buzz that was surrounding it. Bottom-line, the first film isscary, the second is fun, and the third is cancer. The creeper did notage well. Someone behind the camera has clearly lost their touchbecause this one just felt like a cheap, direct-to-video cash grab madewithout love or legitimate purpose. Avoid this one like the creeperhimself and hope it goes away for 23 years... and then another 23 afterthat. p.s. The ending is the biggest slap in the face to fan ever because thefilmmakers know they won't be making another one... and I thank God forthat.
