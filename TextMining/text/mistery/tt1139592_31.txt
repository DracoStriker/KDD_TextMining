I just left the theater after seeing jeepers creepers 3 and I have tosay that I am extremely disappointed. It wasn't necessarily a badmovie, I have seen worse. But it just didn't deliver after years ofwaiting. I left the theater with no more knowledge of the creeper orhis origin than I did when I went in. The characters in the movierepeatedly let us know that every 23 years for 23 days the creaturegets to eat. We KNEW that already, from the other two movies. Anotherthing that bothered me is the addition of contraptions on thecreature's truck that were no where in sight or even hinted at in thefirst film. He also roars now which is very different than the shrieklike sound he makes in the other two films. His appearance isdifferent; he isn't as gross looking in this movie; he is too humanlike in his moves and demeanor. He could pass for a regular man wearinga mask. He also doesn't seem to be able to tell if a person is dead oralive anymore, even when said person is suddenly unwrapped, stillmoving when the truck door is opened, and breathing heavily. Victimsalso now escape for the most part unnoticed, and will barely a scratch.Supposedly this movie takes place the morning after Darry was taken andhad his eyes stolen by the creeper. So the creeper snatched Darry, lita hundred candles, turned on a record player, carved out the back ofDarry's head... All of that which we saw at the end of the first movie.But at the same time he was stealing his truck back from the people onthe tow truck, all in the same night? How did he manage to find thetime? Unnecessary love story and other plot points that serve nopurpose or that are left unexplained. Characters making the dumbestdecisions that no real person would make. Plenty of jump scares.Attempt at a twist ending involving the bus from the second film. Seemslike there may be a sequel in the works. If so I'll wait for the DVDnext time. Very disappointed.
