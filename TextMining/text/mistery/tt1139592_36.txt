I cannot say I was totally satisfied with this one, but there are acouple reasons for it. First, they never tell you or go into greatlength to tell you anything about the creeper's origins, reasons foreating or why he even exists. The second is that they did notcompletely close off the story, in my opinion. I also did not find itas exciting as previous creeper movies, my own perspective on that one.Enjoyable, yes, but I felt as though they could have done more on thisone. If there is another creeper movie in the future, I hope it isbetter than part 3. Left much to be desired for me.
