!MAJOR SPOILERS IN PARAGRAPH 3! I can see why this movie was hated bysome people but you have to give the director some credit.On my point of view on the movies the 2 are about surviving the Creeperwhere as in this installment it's more about mystery and origin.Another thing different is that it takes place more during the day thannight and brings back the truck we never really got to see in JeepersCreepers 2. We never actually get to hear it's song at all for somereason and serves as a secret prequel to 2.The thing about this is I could see the directors trying to make thisfilm different than the others. They tried as hard as they could yet itdoesn't really beat the expectations of 1 or 2 still.The thing that ticked me off is we don't get to see it's origins.This film was a very well driven plot that doesn't meet my expectationseven though they tried to make us viewers like it. This film ISWATCHABLE and possibly worth buying for a little bit of thrill and towatch a few times a year.
