What an absolute disappointment! I loved the Jeepers Creepers and wasreally looking forward to this. It was boring, every single characterwas unlikeable and pointless, there was no suspense, nothing. I don'teven know what to say, this was absolutely TERRIBLE.Don't even think about spending money to see this trash and re-watchthe first (and maybe the second).
