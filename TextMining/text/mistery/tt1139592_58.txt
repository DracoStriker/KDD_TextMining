First off. let's deal with the director. He did something awful and hepaid for it, as far as the justice system can do. What is blindinglyobvious is that he is an exceptional director (I mean, even 'Powder'sticks in the mind with some awesome beauty). Michael Bay can only weep(all the way to the bank, but still). This guy is exceptionally good atwhat he does. It is probably best to keep him away from young boys. Itwas probably best to keep Charles Dodgson (Lewis Caroll) away fromyoung girls also. All that said. This is a worthy addition to theCreeper story-line and I must admit to looking forward to more.
