For a lower budget horror film, JC3 does an admirable job in living upto the quality of its predecessors. The film takes place between theevents of the first and second films and also brings Trish (GinaPhilips) back for a nod to a potential fourth installment. The infamoustruck is back and is as diabolical as ever, with a few new twists.Editing really lends itself to a thriller-type feel, but still with agood deal of kills/blood in keeping with the canon. Acting by theprincipals was generally excellent, Jonathan Breck is still in topform. CGI weaker in quality than most films today, given the budgetshortcomings, but not any worse than the first film. All-in-all,thought it was better than the trailer hinted, and am looking forwardto the re-match between Trish and the Creeper in an upcoming sequel!
