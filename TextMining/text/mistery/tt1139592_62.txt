So I thought Jeepers Creepers 3 was going to be the return of Tricia,seeking justice for her brother, but instead they did some weird fillerbetween the two movies, and saved Tricia's return for the 4th movie ifthey even make one. So the movie begins at the end of the first movie,by the jail that JP takes Darry. But here's the issue. JP2 gives youthe impression that JP2 is 23 years later than JP, but in actually all3 movies occur in the same 23 days. JP makes his first appearance in 1,then JP 3 take place in between, and at the end of JP3 we see theschool bus and are told that the end of JP2 is actually the end of thestory. But playing off of JP2, the farmer is sitting in the barn as anold man, waiting for the monster to return. This story line doesn'tmake any sense. And if Tricia is waiting for the monster, are we to seeTricia as an old women in JP4. This movie seriously might have ruinedthe whole series all together.
