This movie was a disappointment with many flaws. It actually does looklike a made for TV edition with terrible CGI and terrible editing. Ihardly notice any editing, but cut between scenes was jarring. Theacting was still good, and the Creeper still scares. Salva stillmanages to create a sense of tension in some of the scenes. I guess heis getting rusty. Yet how the story connects with part one and part twois awesome. I guess if Salva was given a proper budget, he could havedelivered because bits of the movie were truly awesome. I am stillhoping to see Jeepers Creepers 4 though.
