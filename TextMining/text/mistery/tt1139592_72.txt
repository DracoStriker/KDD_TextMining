Victor Salva did well in the first two installments of JeepersCreepers. And he messed up with this third film. What's with thespecial effects? It's like it was degraded. There are redundant scenesand some scenes were also unexplained. The part where they touched thedismembered Creeper's hand, you thought they already know the secretsto killing the Creeper but in the end, they didn't.Lastly, I read somewhere, they're writing and going to release asequel. I suggest if they don't have the budget, don't repeat what theydid in this third Jeepers Creepers film. They're just going to ruin itagain. Perhaps, make the 4th film the last.Thanks!
