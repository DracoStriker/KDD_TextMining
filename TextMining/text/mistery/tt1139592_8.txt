Honestly, to me the movie was a complete and utter let down. I had somehigh expectations for this movie because the 1st and 2nd movie were sogood and I thought this 3rd movie would have been way better. Although,when I went to the movies to see the movie I was really disappointed onhow it turned out. There were many flaws from the movie. For example onhow the video effects and cinematography turned out, this had way moregreen screen action then the 1st and 2nd movie those two movies tookplace in the open and I think this movie didn't get enough of the openarea. Also I was a little disappointed that they didn't tell us who Jeeperscreepers really was. That was one of the reasons I wanted to see themovie. I do understand why the movie looked the way it did because thevideo effects and it was because they were on a low budget which isalso why it wasn't advertised as much. So probably why a lot of peopledidn't know about the movie's release date or anything. Even with a lotof the things that was wrong with the movie I just hope in some way ifthey make another movie it comes out to be better.
