Jeepers Creepers 3 sees the return of that hideous monster who likes toprey on defenceless young boys. But that's enough about HIM?let's geton with talking about the film?This third entry in the Jeepers Creepers series stars Gabrielle Haughas Addison, who finds herself gathered up and thrown into the back ofthe rusty old truck owned by 'The Creeper' (Jonathan Breck), who hasreturned after 23 years to once again feed on unwary teenagers. Out totry and rescue her is Buddy Hooks (Chester Rushing) who isn't happyabout Addison being snatched away before he can declare his love forher.An incredibly muddled script, sloppy editing, dreadful CGI, a seeminglyinvincible creature that drives a cartoonish vehicle loaded with boobytraps and a range of fancy weaponry (including a Creeper? javelin,Creeper? shuriken, and Creeper? homing road mines), and loads ofunanswered questions (despite suggesting that we might at last be givensome facts about the monster's origin): JC3 is an extremelydisappointing sequel in almost every way imaginable.Whatever your opinion of director Victor Salva as a person, it's hardto deny that he can turn out a fairly decent film when he really tries,but this one feels like little more than a life-less cash-in to bleedmoney from avid fans. If you're looking for revolting gore or decentscares, definitely look elsewhere: this one has neither (unless youcount Meg Foster's frightening countenance. Old age can be a cruelmistress).
