Kinda a letdown after waiting so long and nothing was resolved.. part 4better be worth it. Felt the plot was dumb and only the last scene wasthe best. The cgi was kinda bad at some parts. Acting was terrible insome ways also but what do we expect from a horror flick i guess. Letshope part 4 brings this series to justice!
