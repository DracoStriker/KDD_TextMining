My god, that was AWFUL. Just random made-for-trailer tiny scenes thatadd to nothing, have zero depth and don't make up a coherent plot.Wall-to-wall inappropriate songs that come at random times. Boring plot(if you can even call it that), boring and indistinguishable flatcharacters. Harley Quinn was annoying. Jared Leto did his best as TheJoker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears atrandom times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and nostory. If you've seen the trailers, you basically saw all theone-liners and "money shots".If all that isn't enough, the last third of the movie is simplyunwatchable.I don't think David Ayer is a bad director (I liked HARSH TIMES andFURY), but this is definitely his worst movie yet and I'm pretty sureit's due to massive pressure from the producers.
