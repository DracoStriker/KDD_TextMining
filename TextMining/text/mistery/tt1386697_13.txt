- Story line: what story line? - Wasted really good characters.Literally just threw them in this big pile of crap. - Should've justmade the movie about the joker and harley quinn. Perhaps a cameo bydeadshot instead of this 123min waste of time and money. - JoelKinnaman... why? seriously, who the hell put this guy in the movie? -clichés. clichés everywhere. - the ending was good. because I finallygot to go home, watch netflix and forget about this horrible, horriblething.Please, do not watch this movie at the movie theater. Not even at home.Just make a new movie in your head and pretend that this one does notexist. Trust me, whatever you imagine gets an Oscar compared to thisthing.I love movies, and consider myself with a decent amount of knowledge torate a movie and this, my friends, is a total disappointment.
