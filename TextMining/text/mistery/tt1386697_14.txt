Talk about corny jokes, this movie is full of them. The story is sopredictable and the characters are not good at all. Will Smith asDeadshot, bad, Harley Quinn, annoying, Killer Croc unbelievable,boomerang dumb, Joker just ridiculous.How did this movie get a 6.8? This was just dumb and the plot made nosense. Where are all the regular super heroes that originally caughtthe ss? Flash, Batman, etc...I really didn't want to see this to begin with cause even the previewslooked corny and bad but my son wanted to go so I took him. Save your money and watch it on video, it won't be long.
