Well, it is happening just as many predicted. In it's failure to keepup with Marvel, DC has begun an implosion of it's universe. It hasdestroyed the Superman and Batman franchises with utterly moronicmovies, horrible directors, ludicrous plots, terrible actors and it hasmade a joke of Wonder Woman, and now they have released this abortioncalled Suicide Squad. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to thismindless escapade into stupidity. Jared Leto's Joker is the goofiestthing I've ever seen and let's face it the TV joker was pretty goofy,but Leto tops it in horrible over the top robotic acting. The plotsucked eggs all the way through. A witch and her brother threaten theworld, and a bunch of lame DC characters go to save it at the lastminute by tricking a thousand or so year old witch who can basicallyread minds and project images into them and she couldn't see what onecharacter is thinking. How utterly ignorant and stupid on the part ofthe writers and the director. The ending was so extremely lame I wantedto ask for my money back. All in all it's a forgettable piece of wastedwork not worth the money to see it. My advice, go see Jurassic Worldagain. At least Bryce Dallas Howard is nice to look at.
