Suicide squad is awful and a waste of your time and money. It's sad tosee that nearly no effort is being put into the storyline of moviesanymore all the money and time is being spent on special effects andfamous actors to bring in the profit.The first half of suicide squad was boring introductions which weren'twell thought out, none of the characters made an impression. Thestoryline didn't make a lot of sense and was just terrible. They had abad as team of villain's and instead of making them evil they turnedall of them into nice guys except Harley Quinn even then she didn't doanything crazy. Why not just make them evil and get on with it theytried to make a few of them seem ashamed of their crimes what a waste.the guy with fire superpowers was scared to use them for most of themovie...? I think the movie industry should be ashamed of themselves..Where has their passion gone for writing a masterpiece and why has thepublic rolled over and accepted such garbage from people that getmajorly overpaid. They get paid to entertain and they are failing attheir job, no effort at all :( !
