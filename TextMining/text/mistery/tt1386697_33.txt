I won't lie, the movie isn't perfect. A few jokes fall flat, and makethose moments awkward, but the rest is superb. The acting was more thanI expected out of this movie. In terms of acting, I'll go in order ofmy top 3: Robbie, Leto, and Smith. All of their portrayals areexcellent. El Diablo is a nice surprise, his character made us feel forhim, maybe even more-so than the top stars. Leto knocks it out of thepark. As a Ledger fanboy, I was dreading his performance, but hischaracter was amazing down to the slightest movement. No amount ofdialogue is wasted nor any simple movement is wasted. Overall, the movie was great, again, some awkward script, but theaction scenes are done extremely well and the acting is great. 8/10.Leagues above Batman v Superman in my opinion.
