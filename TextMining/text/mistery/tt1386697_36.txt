Just like any comic book made into a movie. I keep asking myself, WHY?Take a page out from Netflix. Make it a series with low budget actorsand you'll get more out of it. But I guess you don't do it for thefans. You do it for the money you want to take from the fans. You cantput 20 mins of back stories then an hour and a half of running aroundshooting things and lame jokes only to disappoint us. The more you makethis crap the more I will go read more books and graphic novels. I wishI could say nicer things about a movie that I was looking more forwardto seeing Joker than anything else.. And whats up with Batman lookinglike hes 230lbs in a fatman costume?
