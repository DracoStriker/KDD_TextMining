I'm gonna start this review by saying that Robbie was good,some cornylines,but she was still good,Leto is good for the amount of screen timehe got,definitely will be a great Joker if he gets more screen time thenext time he appears,and if you have to know,he's not better than Jackor Heath,but i liked his performance,some choppy editing,the Batmancameo was amazing,i loved Croc as well,but the best performance is byWill Smith as Deadshot and Joel Kinnamann as Rick Flag,they absolutelykilled it,the villain was weak,Amanda Waller is a boss,the mid creditsscene is also very cool,the movie had me on the edge of my seat,whilenot a amazing film,it's still very good,i think that this'll be thefirst DCEU movie that will get good reviews,and also the soundtrack isgreat.
