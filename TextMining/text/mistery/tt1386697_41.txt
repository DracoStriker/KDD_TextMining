Y'know I didn't hate this like everyone in the world seems to. Thecharacters were colorful, big. I guess it's a tough task to get themall equal screen time. My suggestion would have been to cut back on themembers. Problem solved.It doesn't quite have the fun of the trailer, which can happen whensomeone not involved with film cuts something that may not representthe film.Harley Quinn obviously a stand out, but the BIG ONE for me, was seeingBatman, albeit briefly. Just enough to tantalize. Wetted my appetitefor his solo film which can't come soon enough.
