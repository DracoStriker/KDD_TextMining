Tatsu Yamashiro is Katana with a soul stealing sword.There is Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the psycho love of The Joker(Jared Leto). A powerful danger is unleashed in Midway City and thegroup is called.This was critically panned by the majority. I expected more of a mess.The story is simple and easy to follow. No doubt, there are somejarring edits with some disjointed flow. It's a little bothersome butit doesn't make it incomprehensible. The movie just keeps hitting speedbumps with annoying little problems. What's with Enchantress'movements? Her whole character is problematic. Why would Harley Quinngo back? Why would Waller kill everyone? There are varying problems inthe writing. On the positive side, these are interesting characterswell played by skilled actors. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and JaredLeto are standouts. Joker and Harley Quinn have a great story together.If anything, this shows potential for these characters into the future.
