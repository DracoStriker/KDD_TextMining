Wow. What an unbelievable mess of a movie.As someone who is good friends with several of the crew members of thisfilm, I can tell you for a fact that David Ayer did NOT have any clearvision of this project and had no respect for his crew, the actors, WB,the DC characters themselves, or comic books in general. The amount of reviews posted about how his "brilliant" "dark visions"were destroyed/manipulated by WB studios make me unsure of whether tocringe or burst into laughter.This movie was doomed from the moment they hired him to write anddirect. Next time, hire someone who actually LIKES comic books, values thecreative work of others, and knows how to treat human beings withrespect.
