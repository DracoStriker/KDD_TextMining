Unpleasant from start to finish would be an understatement, SuicideSquad makes Batman and Robin look like The Dark Knight. Everyone isvile, nothing has meaning, nothing has explanations and who cares ifthe characters die, because there really unlikeable to begin with.David Ayer is also the man responsible for the revoltingly bad Sabotagefrom 2014, and it seems he is never going to overcome his new journeyinto awfulness, as his action scenes are messy and bland, he may not bethe main one to blame for this thing being unleashed upon the humanrace, but he's still a huge part of said blame with having the title ofboth director and writer of Suicide squad now on his resume. On to other problems (meaning everything), Will Smith (Deadshot) playshimself, but he was the least annoying person in this film somehow.Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) is painfully unfunny and camp, JaredLeto's Joker is cringe inducing, Cara Delevingne should stick tomodelling as she has no noticeable emotions, and the rest of thesuicide squad characters are offensively lame, as there's barely anycharacterization I don't need to mention them. Now for the dialogue"she had mouth" (said by some guy with a ponytail), Harley Quinn saysto the Japanese ninja, "Love ya, nice perfume, is that the stench ofdeath" part of me was cringing, the other wanted this ninja to stop herfrom participating any further. Also "Now that's killer wrap" also fromQuinn, and then later on when they save the colonel and he says thanksand she says "Shut up", I have never in all my life heard someone saythat after been shown gratitude. Other passages of dialogue that are utterly horrendous include, "you'lljust tourists" from Killer Croc and anything said by either HarleyQuinn, Jared Leto's Joker, Jai Courtney and Cara Delevingne on screen.Yes the writing is bloody awful but the actors are equally as abysmal,here's a couple of scenes that had me yearning for a power cut, Quinnjumps into chemical waste for Joker's love, yes because we all want totry and commit suicide for another person, then there's Viola Davis asthe boss of this mission, who says she needs to clear up evidence, andkills a load of FBI agents who are working for her, why I might add?Well because if you don't have a plot you can do whatever you want.Last but not least I could not forget this scene, The Mexican guy withall the tattoos says he kills women and children, meaning his ownfamily, in which he at least shows a bit of remorse, however Quinn says"Own that S**t" meaning be proud of killing your wife and twodaughters, which is so disgusting I almost turned this thing off. The editing is terrible, the music ranges from good to absolutelyhorrific, the visuals are horrendous, the CGI is so bad it makes BatmanV Superman look well made; we also get a lot of grim scenes, includingcharacters getting needlessly tortured and a scene where Leto shoots aguy in the face during a "business deal", but as Suicide squad is voidof plot, characterization, character development, likable characters,acting, and everything else that a film should contain, why botherasking, Batman is even shoehorned in somewhere, people survive plentyof helicopter explosions too, nothing is explained, there's no motivesand I'm bored trashing this garbage. Suicide squad is one of the worstfilm's I have ever seen, and I have sat through Transformers:Ex-stinktion and the depressing Twilight series, it's an abominationthat should be discarded into your nearest trashcan. 0/10
