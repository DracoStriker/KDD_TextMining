I personally think that Suicide squad is a great movie to introducejustice league. The presence of flash and batman helps the viewer tounderstand justice league plot and explain what really happen when theylost superman in batman vs superman saga. Will smith's role is quiteastonishing and I consider his role as alive. Amanda walker is so mean.Captain boomerang is a little bit wooden. The quality of the humors wasfantastic. I enjoyed them so much. I think SC should have notablevillain (bad guy) character. Personally I think Enchantress shouldn'tbe the villain. She didn't really portray the "bad side" of the movie.The main reason why Enchantress turns against Amanda is because shethreatens her. She is not the bad side, Amanda is. It will be cool ifJoker be the villain instead (lol). I love the new joker. Simplicityand elegant combined. He is totally will be the bad ass during the nextDC movie. Can't wait to watch him. The flashbacks to introduce all thecharacter were great. Simple and straight to the point. SC is able toshow the good side of Harley despite she is totally the bad villain.Joker's helicopter accident was a great plot twist. In terms of generalplot, I still didn't see the connection between SC and dark knightrises and the previous DC movies. I hope the next DC movie can providethe viewers with the connections
