I really don't get it, and to be honest I don't think it's fair for thepeople who have worked on this movie at all. My friend and I watchedthe Suicide Squad in the cinema, and we had a great time!Sure, the movie's not perfect, it's got flaws, and not quite as good asI expected, (I may have over-hyped it) but it's not nearly as bad asthe critics were saying!Plus you can't entirely blame David Ayer, the director. After all, hewas only given six weeks to write the script. Not to mention the WarnerBros, Studio have developed a bad habit at meddling with recent DCmovies. (BvS? Ring any bells?) So I can't wait till I get my hands onthe extended cut.Gotta hand it to the cast, by the way, and the dynamic they have off-screen is so heart-warming! They looked like they had the most funwhile filming, so I'm really hoping there will be future SS projects,just to see them together again.
