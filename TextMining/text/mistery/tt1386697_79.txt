The name of the movie gives it away, SUICIDE! If you lack the courageto commit suicide, don't hesitate to buy a ticket to this film. Should get the job done after the first 40 mins (which is how long ittook to introduce the characters). Thank Christ Tom Hardy opted out of this for Iñárritu. Shame about the $10 I will never get back.Also a shame about the 120 mins of my life I will never get back.Quite appalled that they thought they can pull off a Queen song in thisgarbage. The 1 star in my review goes to the sound department who clearly have agood taste in music but an atrocious taste in jobs. Margot Robbie isalso good to look at.All in all, absolute dog s*it.
