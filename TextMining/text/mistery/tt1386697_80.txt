I'm seeing a lot of good reviews for this movie, and I can't evenfathom why. There's nothing redeemable about the absolute wreck that Ijust saw. An alternate title to this movie could be "Plot where?",considering not a spec of this script spoke of originality. This wasvery clearly a mixup of every superhero movie stereotype possible, andit didn't work. It could have worked, but it didn't, and I'm asdisappointed as the next guy. It was a complete mess of tropes, misusedplot devices and characters with no depth. The most disappointing thingabout this movie, honestly, is how bad it is. It's not funny bad. It'spitifully bad. It's an uninspired mess who's only light is it'scharacters, none of who are given enough screen time or good writing tomake completely work, despite great acting by Will Smith, MargotRobbie, and Jay Hernandes, among others. Great idea. Terribleexecution. The result? A movie not worth spending your time or moneyon.
