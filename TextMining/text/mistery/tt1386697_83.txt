After 55 minutes i left cinema, this was unwatchable. You can watch100s movies just like this. It is poor made superhero movie with badjokes all over the movie.It was about 10+ superhero characters thatwere prisoners and later they were set free to help war against aliens.After 1h I was so bored i had to leave cinema. This was some of theworst movies I have ever saw really. I was most annoyed because theytried to make some poor comedy between actions scenes. I can say that Ionly liked acting of Jared Leto.Please don't ever make this kind of movies anymore. This was only timeI left cineplexx ever in my life.
