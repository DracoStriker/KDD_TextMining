I think the IMDb user rating of 6.5 perfectly encapsulates what toexpect. I use the site mainly to calibrate my expectations beforewatching a blockbuster or decide to invest my time in giving an indiefeature a chance.Suicide Squad has such star power and superhero connections that I wasgoing to watch it no matter what the user reviews said (I alwaysdisregard critic reviews as they rarely are helpful) and feel like manyviewers were going to as well.The movie has cool set pieces, action scenes and fantastic costumes.However, the plot is so muddled and choppy it detracts from the viewingexperience. Another weak link is the enemy - no real backstory to drawus in, almost no explanation on what the enemy is building, and almostlaughable minions for the "heroes" to combat.There are so many cool characters, I think the movie and plot wouldhave been better served if this had been Part I of a series, rather astand alone movie.I read an article that stated David Ayer only had six weeks to put ascript together and it unfortunately it shows. I felt like I waswatching a long trailer - cool and fun scenes that were disconnectedfrom each other.I certainly won't say to pass on this, especially comic book fans, butbe warned it is a let down. Especially, considering the awesome sourcematerial the director had to work with.
