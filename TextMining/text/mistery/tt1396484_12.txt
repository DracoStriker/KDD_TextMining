What is this? Horror for kids? This movie convinces me that the worldhas gone mad. This is entertainment for what age groups exactly? If itsfor adults, why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealingto the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching thislevel of blood, guts and graphic murder? The story line is directedtowards a certain mentality, which is not of appeal to adults, at leastnot mature adults. Why on earth is this so popular? It failed to scareme on so many levels that I found myself imagining better scenes. Howis it acceptable that kids of 12 years old were in the audience,looking at images of even younger children in the movie having theirarm torn from their body, a man with a knife right in his throat? Whatthe hell?! As soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were theirimaginations, it was a pointless exercise. What happened to all thekids that were floating down at the end? Where was the main charactersbrother at the end? Wait for the next episode? No thanks. I would haveenjoyed a psychological horror, but gore is not what I was expecting.Shows a lack of imagination by the director that he had to resort tothis level of candy coated perversity. What a shame.
