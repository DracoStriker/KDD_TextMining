Wow, I honestly can't believe these reviews. I made an IMDb accountjust to write a review. I love the original and have seen it manytimes. This movie was horrible! I feel insulted by the directors. Itwasn't scary at all. Any potential "scary" scene was downplayed byjokes so forcefully inserted into the script. There are multiple, majorholes in the story line as well. Hole 1: the group of bullies never once said anything about their buddymissing.Hole 2: the girl is pulled down from "floating" and brought back tolife. Doesn't that mean that the hundreds of kids that come down fromfloating at the end come back to life too? Or do their rotting corpsesfill up the sewers for 27 years? Does Georgie come back to life too?Hole 3: the girl can't decide which boy she loves. She took the poemfrom the pudgy kids room (I have to assume because she randomly ends upwith it in her bedroom) but then she thinks that Bill wrote the poemsomehow. The pudgy kid kisses her, bringing her back to life (true lovebrings back the dead girl like Princess & the Frog or something) butshe winds up with Bill. Every cheesy, horror film jump scene was witnessed in this film. Theacting was good, but I can't see how this is touted as a horror film. Ifelt like I was watching a Disney movie by the end of it.
