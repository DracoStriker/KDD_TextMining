If you've ever seen the original, and you have even the slightestmodicum of respect for originality, story telling and artisticintegrity, this movie should infuriate you. Firstly, it isn't really amovie. There is no story. It's basically just a 2 hour collection ofdifferent sorts of scares. The brilliance with the original was that itwas a story of kids torn apart by a traumatic event, and then broughtback together as adults to face their fears and avenge their friend.Great story. But this version was essentially a haunted house on thescreen. They abandoned the kid to adult story and just focused on agroup of kids getting scared. There was way too much "comedy" beingsprinkled throughout. You know, the lame kind where the characters makesome unoriginal comment and everyone in the movie theater bursts outlaughing like Dave Chappelle just hit his stride on stage. And therandom love stories among the kids that didn't matter or further anynarrative. I could write a 10,000 word essay going into the depths ofall that is wrong with this movie so I'll stop. The worst of all iswatching all of America fall in love with this. It makes me feel like acynical jerk, but I think really it's just a clear sign of the dumbingdown of people on this earth. No one respects or cares about greatstorytelling anymore. Just give them cheap pop-up scares and they willbe happy. It really is sad.
