As someone who had high hopes for this movie, I can honestly say I ammonumentally disappointed. In an attempt to make a more visuallystimulating remake of the classic It, this movie ending up looking morelike a Salvador Dali painting, if Dali were extremely tacky. The fearfactor was taken out and replaced with jump scares and unnecessarygore. And I LOVE gore. Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise seemed more like amentally incapacitated pedophile than an embodiment of fear. The onlysalvageable parts of this movie were due to the outstanding childactors and Finn Wolfhard's admittedly immature, yet hilarious wisecracks. I had hoped that because of this the relationship between the 7friends would be properly represented, however, the introduction ofcertain characters and their back stories were extremely rushed orcompletely skipped over despite the fact that this movie was about 2.5hours long and focused only on the childhood of the It characters. Theonly new thing introduced to this movie, that was actually worthwatching was the scene with Bill and Georgie near the end. It might bea fun movie to watch with your friends and laugh at, but don't paymoney to watch it.
