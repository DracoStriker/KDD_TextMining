The opening scene of IT is so promising - well directed, atmospheric,and Skarsgard's clown is compelling to watch. There is a brief momentwhere while laughing mutually with the kid, the clown suddenly goesquiet and stares menacingly. Its brilliantly unsettling. But sadly,that's it as far as unsettling clown performances go - the rest of thefilm is typical CGI scares, and the clown throwing out taunts like thederiative satire of Scary Terry in Rick and Morty. The cinematography and acting is great. Its watchable in an afternoonNetflix kind of way. But there is no real gist, goal or drive to thestory, it all just sort of unfolds scene after scene, goalless anddrifty like the string-along nature of a Police Academy film. Its OK - but it really isn't the classic that people are making out tobe. Its been incredibly over-hyped. I personally found Insidious to bea far more effective supernatural chiller.
