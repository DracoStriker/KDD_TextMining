I managed to win a preview screening to 'IT' on the 30th of August, inSydney. I had high expectations for this film - and IT exceeded them. The acting. Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry,and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded meof Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (playedby Finn Wolfhard) was my favourite and his jokes cracked the wholecinema up. Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise is scary and really creeped meout, but for me there was just something missing about his characterand I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms withthe development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaptionfrom a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it (no pun intended) was a great thriller film that kept me onthe edge of my seat, with strong performances.
