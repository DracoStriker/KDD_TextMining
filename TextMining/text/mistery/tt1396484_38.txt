There is no possible way that anyone could seriously rate this movieeven close to the scores on this site. This movie is the first movie I have walked out of in 10 years. I am ahuge fan of this genre and this to me was the ultimate disappointment.I actually cringed at a lot of the "horror scenes", very very lame.At 45 minutes in I had to check my ticket to see how much longer Iwould have to endure the pain. After realising how much longer I had togo, a swift exit took place. I hope you read this review before wasting your time and money.
