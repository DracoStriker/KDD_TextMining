I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of IT in Brisbane.The film is absolutely brilliant. Bill Skarsgård has taken Pennywiseand made the role his own. Creepy, disturbing, humorous, IT reallypossess the creep factor, giving audiences a new reason to fear clowns. The entire casting choices were sensational. All actors really heldtheir own, creating a sense of comradery between the characters. Like most people, I do hold the miniseries with Tim Curry close to myheart, but after seeing this adaptation, I was beyond pleasantlysurprised. So much so that upon IT being released into cinemas, I'll beback in line to see it again.
