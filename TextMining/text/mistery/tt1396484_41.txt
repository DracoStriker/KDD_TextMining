Having just gotten in from watching this brilliant example of cinema, Ican safely say I'm glad this was my first outing with the works of themaster author Stephen King. It was beautifully terrifying with its (nopun intended) blend off of practical effects and CGI. All of the actorsgave good performances and that goes double for the child actors in it.They definitely prove that not all child actors are sub-par while notbeing able to hold up along side the adults in the film. To pick outthe stand outs among them: Jaeden Lieberher as the main character, BillDenbrough, and Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh. I can see healthycareers ahead of them because of their performances in this film.To address the elephant in the room; or - if you prefer - clown in thesewer: Pennywisie the dancing clown was easily the best performance inthe entire film. Bill Skarsgard definitely shines as a brilliantvillain and monster. He truly was terrifying and mysterious in how heacted and spoke. Though, he does take multiple forms throughout thefilm and all of which were unsettling and terrifying. The clown formwhich you most see him in was the most memorable of the lot and is mosticonic & memorable thing out of the film.I look forward to what lies in store in a possible second chapter tothis terrifying tale from the master of horror, Stephen King. It willmost probably come in the form of the story of the adult versions ofthe characters. I will definitely be going to see it if it does getmade.
