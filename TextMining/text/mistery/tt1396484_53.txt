IT has the It factor. The star of the movie was for sure Bill Skarsgårdhe put the name Pennywise in the word horror. He was just plain outterrifying. I have not seen a movie this damn good in a very long time.It was just not the best movie of the year it was the best movie I haveever seen in the theaters and I just didn't see it once, but twice. Byfar Bill Skarsgård should win an Oscar for Best actor and the movieitself should win for Best feature film.Parents IT is rated R and when you see Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise youwill see why it is just plain out scary. It will definitely makeeveryone wet there pants that is how Scarry it is. I recommend to wearmore the one pair of underwear to make sure you don't wet yourself.Hope you enjoy IT.HERE TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You'll Float Too
