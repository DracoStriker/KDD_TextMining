To summarize my up coming review I'll start by saying "I really did notlike this movie" The movie IT is "in simple terms" about the strugglesand fear youth face when they being to come of age. In my eyes thismovies success came solely from good marketing, because the movie'strue foundation is filled with: poor acting, shotty scrips and reallyunthoughtful horror. To me the movie IT is only a 3 out of 10 starmovie, making it a strong "below meh" ? Like always the only way tofind out the quality of a movie is to go out and see it for yourself.Enjoy! (if you can lol)
