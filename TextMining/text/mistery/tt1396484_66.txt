I appreciate acting, cinematography, music, settings, locations,lighting...the works, in films. But I just can't seem to love this. Ifthey had stayed with that haunted looking house as the main setting,then I would have really liked it. But let me list all the randomplaces in this film: school, a few different homes of the kids, alibrary, a cellar, a haunted house, the sewers, the woods, thewaterhole, the town, the garage, the pharmacy...I'll stop there. It wasjust small glimpses of every place to try and shed light on everysingle thing, it was almost like it wasn't a straight story to follow.Alas, some of them were great. Some scenes dragged, some scenes weren'tenough. The clown itself was great: scary, good voice and acting. Butit kept shape shifting into weird things haha. The kids were good, butnot as amazing as people are saying in reviews. It was well filmed too.There was one scene in the movie that just turned me off and lost myinterest..and that was the 'cleaning the bathroom'. I thought, okay..sothey just happen to have all these cleaning supplies and extra glovesand they are gonna clean it top to bottom? Shouldn't it justdisappear?! Anyways. Watch it yourself and see how you go. I'm not sadI paid to see it. Just wanted it a little more basic and not soexaggerated.
