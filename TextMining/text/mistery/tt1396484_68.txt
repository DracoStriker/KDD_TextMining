I was so disappointed. Bill Skarsgård was a great depiction of a scaryclown, but, as another reviewer noted, the movie itself was scary--ifyou were a 10 year-old. There was just a lot of silliness that causedme to quickly lose interest.On a side note, it's been a while since I've been to the movies. I'vebeen reading about how movie attendance is down. Maybe it's because ofthe morons who pay $11 a ticket and then spend the entire movie talkingout loud or otherwise making noises they might do at home in front oftheir own TV.
