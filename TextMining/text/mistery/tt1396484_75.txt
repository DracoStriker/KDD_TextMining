If you liked The Goonies, you'll love this. A shockingly poor attempt at producing a horror. Terrifying, it is not.Scary, it is not. I've seen more horror at at child's party. Thetea-cup ride at your local fair ground will give you more of a thrill.Talk about the cliché central. A slow, plot holed, far fetched,continuity riddled farce. CGI was cheap and out of place. This is NOT a horror, or even a b-movie horror. This is more akin to acomedy at best. Of course you'll get the odd 'jump factor' thrown infor good measure - even these are predictable and poorly scripted. Sadto say, Scary Movie would deserve an Oscar pitted against this mess.The only saving grace was the make-up department did a great job andthe acting wasn't completely off.The hype surrounding this film was very well done - I congratulate themarketing and PR companies spin for a complete piece of trash. Please, please please - do not franchise this. No more!It's not worthy of the big screen cinema. Save your money, wait for theDVD/Bluray release to turn up in your local penny shop.
