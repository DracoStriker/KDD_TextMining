I felt obligated to write a review, due to not just a slight differencebetween the movie rating and the actual experience our whole theaterroom was having. It really felt like cheap and intimidatingly boringmovie that can not be compared to any good horror film. Me and my groupof friends were really close to actually leaving the room, there wasconstant laugh about the predictability and cliché moments. The wholetime was happening so much but still nothing actually happened. And Iwouldn't call it scary but disgusting. There was no actual builttension but just one big WTF. The kids were fun at some moments of themovie, and the story definitely has a good ground but it was terriblyadapted into the movie. I cant remember the movie thag annoyed me as atthis one even though I consider myself patient and open about differentkinds of movies.
