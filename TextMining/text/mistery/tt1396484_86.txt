The truth about this movie is that it's not scary. All of the contentconcerning the clown is pretty good but it's another one of thosethings where you're like "I wish he was in a different movie." Becausethey went way overboard with the comedy in this. In fact, the reasonthis is even rated R is not because of anything gruesome or scary. No,not at all. This is rated R because of the language. The movie islittered with d*** jokes and s*** jokes all throughout the entire moviefrom start to finish.While the movie is well shot, good soundtrack and great cinematography,the scares that we came for do not deliver! They use every lastpredictable Hollywood horror cliché in the book for every scare that'snot the clown.And the finale. Okay, so the clown gets clowned. They literally endthis clown to the point where the clown is scared of the kids and thekids aren't scared of the clown at all. None of them die by the way.There are no stakes. And yet the movie still tries to setup a sequel.Can you believe that?Many of these characters I didn't even like. With the main characterkinda being an a****** dragging their friends into danger chasing downwhat they already know is not real. The female character being poorlytreated and the psychopathic bully who gets discarded from the filmlike he was never there in the first place.No, this movie does not deserve a sequel and I hope it doesn't get one!Stop right where you are!I may have to stop going to the movies. I really thought this was goingto be a good one.
