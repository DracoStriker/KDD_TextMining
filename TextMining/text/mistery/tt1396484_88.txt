When I heard all the talk of the new movie, It, I was nothing butexcited to see what the film had in store. Unfortunately, the moviedidn't quite live up to the hype. There were many amazing scenesthroughout the film, with top notch music, creepy moments, andsurprisingly good child actors.I think the downfall lies in the lack of scare factor, the run time,and the mass amounts of comedy. I have no issue with comedy in a horrormovie, but when the movie is over 2 hours long and 60% is comedy, Istart to wonder where the scares are. I found myself laughing in scenesthat were supposed to be serious due to characters trying to throw in"just one more joke" which began to wear on me. It's a good movie and should definitely worth the watch if you were afan of the original or just looking for a new horror flick.
