All in all I can say that this is a good remake of the old IT moviewith slightly more gore compared to the previous one. It was not asscary as I anticipated, but the story line is still good.Even though I have not read the Stephen king novel of IT but wasanticipating the movie. Considering it was the first time watching ahorror in the cinema, it wasn't as horror as was being told by reviews. It is more of a thriller and adventure sort of a movie.
