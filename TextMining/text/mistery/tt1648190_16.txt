This is well worth watching if you know nothing of the books on whichit was based. I never read the books so my viewpoint is not biased inthat manner. It has a good story arc and the main villain isconsistently ruthless and the characters were well cast. Their are noslow points anywhere in this movie so the audience can expect no lag towaste their time. The ending is good and it leaves open a prequel orsequels.
