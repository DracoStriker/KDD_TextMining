It's a 7 or 8 out of 10 movie. I gave it 10 to even out the negativeratings. It's one of the good movies released in this year, withexcellent acting by everyone, especially 3 lead characters. The moviewas thoroughly enjoyable and pacy. Only downside is that the actiontowards the end was short. The reason for the negative review, as manyhave pointed out here, is that the movie did not do proper justice tothe books. While, that's true, it doesn't make the movie bad. Quiteoften we see that screen adaptations are not quite as good as thebooks, e.g. a song of ice and fire, that doesn't make the screenadaptation bad. To give 1-5 ratings to this movie is wrong,biased,imbalanced and grossly unfair to the people behind this movie.
