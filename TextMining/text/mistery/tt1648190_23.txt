I've been reading these books for over two decades now. I was reallypumped about the movie. I saw the very first showing, and I can saythat the negative reviews coming out about this film are unwarranted. First, you have to keep in mind what they were hoping to achieve withthis movie given the budget. It's a similar play to that of the firstHunger Games movie. If they get some traction with this one, then thesubsequent movies/TV series get twice the money to work with. Ipersonally think that they did a fantastic job with this first effort. The acting was solid. The story was actually pretty good. It had somegreat actions sequences, and the CGI was surprisingly good (most of thetime). It was also a very efficient use of time. Every scene helpedexplain the Dark Tower lore to new audiences. It was a fun action flick that doesn't try to repeat the experience ofreading the books. I'll always have the novels. I wasn't expecting thismovie to recreate that experience for me.Plus, as a die hard fan from way back, it was just great to see Rolandand Jake on screen for the first time. It just felt right. Give it a try with an open mind.
