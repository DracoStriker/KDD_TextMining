TL;DR - If a studio picked up this epic saga and made a high budget TVseries with all these actors like HBO did with Game of Thrones, itwould be glorious.Movie was fun. Acting was solid and believable. Even the kid did a goodjob. Action was fun. Only hits were to the rushed story, but still dida great job with the time given. Ending felt rushed. Wish it played outjust a few more minutes of suspense. So I never write reviews, but this movie got a lot of crap thrown at itdue to book readers harsh critics. If you haven't read the books, thismovie will make you want to. That's a good thing. The movie was shorter then expected, but they nailed, a lot together inthat time. It's one of the only hits to the whole movie I didn't enjoy.Just go to the movie, give it a chance, remember that it was "inspiredby the books" and not "based on the books". That means they deviate.You have to when the book translates to screen.
