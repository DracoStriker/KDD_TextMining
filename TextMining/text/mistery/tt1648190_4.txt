You have Idris Elba, Matthew McConaughey 8 books of material, and youput together a 95 minute movie? I absolutely hate that critics have tohold their reviews on these movies so the public cannot be forewarned.Its like restaurant critics not being able to tell you the food is dogmeat until after you place your order. Then there are those fans wholoved the books, so they delude themselves into thinking the movie isgood enough. Frankly the history of Stephen King material and film is amixed bag. The Shining is obviously superior, but when's the last timeyou dug out Dreamcatcher? It just continues to shock me how inept someof these productions are.
