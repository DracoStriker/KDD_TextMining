First of all, I only watch movies which synopsis move me, I never watchthe trailer (from now on, because it could be so many spoilers there).I haven't read the novels, but I bet the novel version would be betterthan the movie. Because it's actually series novel, you'll feel likesome scene is just too fast & crave more of it. I expect this movie tohave some seasons like LOTR or The Hobbit. Looking forward for this tohappen.The concept as expected from Stephen King.
