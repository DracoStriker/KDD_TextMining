I saw "The Dark Tower", starring Idris Elba-The Thor movies, 28 WeeksLater; Matthew McConaughey-Interstellar, Texas Chainsaw Massacre:TheNext Generation; Tom Taylor-Legends_tv, Broken Hearts and Jackie EarleHaley-London Has Fallen, Shutter Island.This movie is based on a series of Stephen King novels-7 or 8 of them,I think-and he has said that his primary influence was 'The Good, TheBad and The Ugly' & 'Lord of the Rings'. FYI: The Dark Tower novelsconnect characters from other Stephen King books into the sameuniverse. If you keep an eye out, you can spot lots of little 'nods' tohis other books and I even saw a movie theater that was showingspaghetti westerns-nod to The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. Anyway, theplot is probably more of what you are interested in, so here goes.There is a big tower at the center of the universe that keeps evil incheck. All these different universes-one of them is ours-surround itand can be reached by using portals. Tom plays a boy on our world thatkeeps having dreams of Idris' world. Idris is a gunslinger-the last ofhis kind-that is in a never ending battle with Matthew, aka, The Man inBlack, a dark and evil sorcerer that is always trying to destroy thetower and unleash evil across all the universes. Matthew can just wavehis hand and say a word, like sleep, and the person will sleep, oranything else, depending on what he says-stop breathing, kill someone,etc. Jackie is one of Matthew's lackeys that do his bidding-probablybecause they are afraid of what Matthew might say to them if theydon't. Tom finds a way to connect with Idris and they team up to tryand stop Matthew. It's rated "PG-13" for gun violence and action andhas a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buyit on DVD.
