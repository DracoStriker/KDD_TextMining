As usual Stephen King was either taken advantage of or gave hisblessing to make this movie. Judging by previous Stephen King flicks,I'm going to say the latter. Stephen King doesn't seem to give a damnwhat Hollywood does with his stuff, I guess he is paid handsomely tosell out. I got a picture in my head of his smiling face with a toothmissing on the cover of Mad Magazine, saying, "show me the money". Allthat being said, I didn't dislike this movie. I've seen a lot worselately. (on a positive note, at least no one was looking stupid smokingcigarettes in this movie, heh heh, that's something at least). This wasbutchery of the books straight up as mentioned many times in reviews.Try to cram that many books into a 1 1/2 hour movie, and you see theresults. Can't be done. With all the shortcomings of this movie though,I was actually entertained and didn't have to grit my teeth trying towatch it like I have lately on a lot of Triple A actor/C Movie dealsHollywood has been turning out lately that have frankly been turning mystomach. This movie didn't glow but it didn't suck either.
