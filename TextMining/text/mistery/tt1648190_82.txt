Reading the best reviews, there are many viewers saying this film isbad or worse. This is one of those times that I disagree vigorouslywith their ratings.I found the story most enjoyable, keeping one hooked to the screen andspellbound for an hour and a half. One must realize that this film isan adventure in fantasy world and it did succeed admirably in thisgenre. On top of it totally devoid of sex (hooray!), which nowadays isfound in all movies for young and old, making its absence an excellentfamily movie.If you are looking for a solid entertaining movie with an originalstory (with some influence of Stephen King's writings) you can't gowrong watching this film. I rate this a sound 8 out of 10, much higherthan the 5.9 presently computed from 32,299 submissions. The true valueis probably closer to 7 plus!
