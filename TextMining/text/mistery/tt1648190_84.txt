Thank God I read the 75% negative reviews and WENT ANYWAY! This moviewas Arnold's LAST ACTION HERO meets JOHN WICK. D-e-f-i-n-a-t-e-l-yenjoyed Hero bonding with the youth aspect. And the final Gunslingervs. 50 baddies gun fight; unparalleled! But STILL my respect to thosewho read Mr. King's seven books...but reviews saying 'both book readerand non book readers think the movie is trash" is not true.
