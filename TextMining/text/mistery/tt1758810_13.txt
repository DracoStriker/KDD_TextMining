It's a real bummer that some people saw this and didn't like it. It's abummer for them since this was one of the best movies I've seen in2017. This a truly unique film and was a breath of fresh air in aclimate of super hero flicks and overdone remakes. The score and thescenes were intoxicatingly beautiful.
