Why is everyone hating on this movie? It was incredibly well shot in beautiful sceneryYes a lot of the acting was weird but isn't horror a kind of weirdgenre anyways? I think a lot of people has misjudged overanalized andcritizised this because it is not perfect. It a part of art you knowand the actors especially Harry Holy really stayed in his character thewhole time. It was a good movie! Thats why 10/10 thumbs up
