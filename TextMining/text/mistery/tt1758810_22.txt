My, my, there is some hate for this movie. I did not read the book, andit seems that most of the disappointed reviews are coming from thosewho did read it and are unhappy with the film version. Putting thatissue aside, there are not enough good murder mysteries being made,like Wind River. Nice bonus is that the scenery is spectacular, and themovie is filmed beautifully. It's the story of two detectives fromdifferent backgrounds, working together to track down a serial killerin Norway. The pace is slow, but not boring, though I was admittedlyready for the pace to pick up about half way through. The revelation ofthe killer is not an OMG moment, in spite of the director's attempts tolead us down different paths. This film reminded me of The CrimsonRivers, with Jean Reno. If Frosty the Snowman had an evil twinbrother...
