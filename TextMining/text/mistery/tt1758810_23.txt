Michael Fassbender plays as Harry Hole. He is drinking a lot while hehas no current assignments as investigator. He has a former girlfriend,who also have a son at school, which he do care about, but his work isalways getting in the way. Harry Hole jumps on a colleague's murdercases, Katrine Bratt, played by Rebecca Ferguson. The serial killerbecomes their case. Unlike the book it is possible to puzzle out who the serial killer maybe. The pace is slow and comfortable. The thriller has added value inform of aesthetics and egalitarian society. It is not likely a critic'schoice since the movie is very easy to analyze. The reviews should notbe as serious as the World Cup in skiing, but rather be an unimportantchildren's cross country competition. I am unknown to the character in the book of Jo Nesbø. That's toughcompetition, although.
