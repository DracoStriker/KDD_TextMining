I made the mistake of reading the book again before watching the movieSo had high expectations. It was The Snowman that got me hooked on JoNesbo and was excited when I saw the trailer. I walked out of it at theend feeling very disappointed.Characters were stripped down to being almost irrelevant. They shouldhave stuck more closely to the book for Katrine Bratt, such animportant part. Ave Stop did not come across as the charismatic mediaguru. Instead, he appeared to be somewhat impotent. ldar Vetlesen mayas well have been cut right out of it. The script very loosely followedthe book. The twists in the plot were poorly handled. The opening Scenefaded to frame the plot and I won't say anymore about that. Val Kilmeras Gert Rafto?? At least the harsh, bleak atmosphere was captured andFassbender did a pretty good job.This movie Should be shown to film students on how not to do it.
