I would have initially given The Snowman a rating of 7. Perhaps even an8... thanks to a solid performance by Michael Fassbender. Even thepremise lends itself to one of my favourite genres. However, the anti-climactic ending spoils the fun. It feels unrealistic and... the ice...come on. 6 because of the ice (not the mom's ice, that was prettygood).I would totally watch another one with Fassbender and his finger.
