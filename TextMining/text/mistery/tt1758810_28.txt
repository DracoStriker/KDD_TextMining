And the movie didn't deliver. Let's start with what was good. Thecinematography, I thought, was nicely done. A typical cold grey lookthat fits the landscape. But the trailer promised a disturbing thrillerfull of suspense. And man, fell the movie short of that! Otherreviewers criticized the loose ends. Yes, it had some. If you spendprecious run-time on J.K. Simmons taking pictures of girls, then Iexpect more pay-off than just a vague hotel room scene and thennothing. Why did they even put his character in the film? And everydeath scene was barely shown and offered very little suspense. On topof that: - The investigation was uninspired and dull. - The film had nohumor. (Doesn't need to, but..) - There was no real characterdevelopment. (How on earth did they manage to make it two hours long?)- The ending is a huge let-down. As anti-climatic as can be.That's it. Oh, and as a mechanic i should point out, that in bothscenes where the ice broke and people drowned... the ice was way toothick for breaking. You can't expect me to believe this.
