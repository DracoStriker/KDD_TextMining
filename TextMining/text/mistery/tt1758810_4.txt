It is a class thriller and gripping till the end. It is one of thefinest in the class of thriller movies in terms of screenplay,photography and last but not least the story telling mechanism isstylish. Mystery is held tight and never could be revealed.Worth for the money. I think the world of movie review must lay outcertain key indicators to be fair and honest and give true review Theonly shock was the general review I saw about this movie but what I sawwas pretty cool. Coolest scenic beauty of European cities and coldwinter snow added to the mystery value including some lifestyle andculture exposure for the audience. There is still room for improvements but the catch is deliberatesubtleties pumped in the screenplay to confuse and keep biting thenails till end with some release of pressure from time to time tointroduce new complexities. Overall a refreshing movie for thrill seekers..
