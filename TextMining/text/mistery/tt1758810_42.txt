I have read all of Jo Nesbø's books about Harry Hole and had bigexpectations about this movie. Perhaps a little bit too big. But goingto see a thriller knowing who the killer is and exactly what's going tohappen is perhaps not the best context to watch a movie with. I thinkthe reason I was so disappointed with this movie, was that it seemedlike they have taken a chapter of a history and just put it out ofcontext.I give it a 6, and that is only because Fassbenders acting and thevisually great quality of some of the scenes. They had such a greatbook to film and the lead actor is perfect, so I do believe they usedthe budget on one actor and just cast the rest on a whim. The femaleleads are horrible and do not fit in their roles. The plot is sort ofput together like a bad puzzle and some of it just don't belong thereat all.I had the same experience with 50 Shades of Grey. Even though I did notlove the books I did look forward to see the first movie, and then theymanage to ruin it with a bad script and worse acting. But well the 5stars for Fassbender is earned, he fits the role and he did act,perhaps not so excellent as in Shame or 12 Years a Slave, but he iswhat I imagined Harry Hole to be.I do also think that the movie would be different if Martin Scorsesehad directed it and if the female lead characters where betteractresses. The movie has some visually great scenes and the music aregood, but it just don't manage to capture you in the way a goodthriller should. You don't get the chills you are supposed to get whenyou see scenes that are supposed to be horrible because they are notconvincing.
