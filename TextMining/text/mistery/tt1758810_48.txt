Let's start off with me saying that I loved the source material when Iread it a few years ago, and when I saw that it's gonna get a movieadaptation I was really hyped for it. This movie had every chance ofbeing something amazing, the book it's based on, the director, the castwould all be amazing, but somehow they messed the whole thing up. They changed parts of the book without thinking how it would effect thewhole story, there are scenes in the trailer that are completelymissing from the movie, and they didn't put enough time into characterdevelopment. The first half showed some potential, but in the end therewere multiple plot lines left hanging without much explanation. Plusthey totally dumbed down the killer and his motivation, and messed upthe killer reveal(that was really well done in the book, at least in myopinion), and the endgame. The killer runs away with Harry's loadedgun, but Harry the super-detective doesn't think that he might comeback and shoot them, so he unties Rakel and Oleg to have a littleemotional time....And then he runs out to chase down the killer whocould just be hiding around the house to shoot him in the back, but no.Harry just goes after him, although he has no idea which way the killermight have gone. And when he catches up he gets shot, and he startsdiscussing that the killer has a wrong ideology just so he would walkcloser. But why did the killer have to take a few more steps at theend? He could have shot Harry from that range easily, but no, he had togo really close, so he can fall into that conveniently placed hole inthe ice and die. Oh and I just absolutely loved that they teased theadaptation for The Leopard, but seeing how this movie fell on its faceI highly doubt that we'll see that happen soon, or maybe ever. I expected more from Tomas Alfredson, although it's not entirely hisfault how this turned out. But at least you can see the beautifullandscapes of Norway, right?
