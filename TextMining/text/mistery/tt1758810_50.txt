Detective Harry Hole investigates the disappearance of a woman whosepink scarf is found wrapped around an ominous-looking snowman. What theactual f*ck did i just watch? The Snowman is a choppy mess withcharacters and actors being wasted completely in a thriller that ismore boring than captivating. Why does people call Harry Hole a"Legend" when for the entire film is either looking at books or he isdrunk? What purpose does Val Kilmer have to be in this film? and whydoes he sound like a robot? And most of all why the f*ck is this movieso slow and boring? For the entire running time nothing happens to behonest except 2 or 3 kills and that's it, we see characters that weknow nothing about on the screen doing absolutely nothing and the filmis a choppy mess i mean it goes from Fassbender walking threw thestreets to him being passed out drunk, then Rebecca Ferguson'scharacter is investigating someone and in less than 3 seconds we seeher sleeping? The entire movie feels like it had a point? but as themovie was going on the studio cut half of it and we get this? The filmgoes from someone being murdered to someone else driving it seriouslyseems to me that it's not the directors fault but the Studio took hisfilm and butchered it to death until we got a boring horror film withVal Kilmer drinking on a roof and Michael Fassbender being passed outfor the majority of it and overall if you thought that Alien Covenantand Song to Song were bad? you haven't seen Michael Fassbender'sdumpster fire "The Snowman".
