Complete waste of a good book, only positive side was excellent actingof Michael Fassbender! They removed everything that makes book one ofthe best crime thrillers ever. Despite Fassbenders great talent mainprotagonists Harry Hole didn't shown his best, he wasn't given a chancedue to poor scene selection. Did director even read the book?
