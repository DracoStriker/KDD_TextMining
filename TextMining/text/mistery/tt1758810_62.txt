Another movie that didn't make much sense. I haven't read the rave-reviewed Jo Nesbo novel it's based on, but this kind of slightly 'noir'Scandinavian police procedural is usually adapted for television. Theingredients are formulaic: a detective with a drink problem (MichaelFassbender) investigates a serial killer who leaves atrademark/signature (the snowman) at each of his gruesome crime scenes.The psychology of the murderer is too lightly sketched in ? abortionand abandonment seem to be part of his motivation ? and the story goesoff in too many directions with too many characters. The pace iserratic and then there's a rushed denouement which has some ludicrouselements, with a death scene that we've seen before (in OMEN 2 andelsewhere).The Norwegian scenery is very attractive and so is Michael Fassbender,although the script doesn't make many demands of him. Did this startout as a 6-hour series? If that's the case, the condensation hascreated a huge muddle, and it's still too long at two hours.
