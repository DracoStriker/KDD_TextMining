It's hard to believe a movie with Michael Fassbender would make me feelthis frustrated. It's possible that he was as lost as most of us in theaudience. Events happened with barely any relationships between them.Characters hardly tolerated being in the same scene with each other. Icouldn't follow much of the story line, and I read the book. Thisshould have been called something else or come in with a warning thatsaid "barely inspired by..."A serial killer is attacking a series of women and leave several cluesto Harry Hole (Fassbender). He's clearly toying with him, and had itbeen another film we probably would have been either rooting forFassbender or fearing for the lives of his close relatives. There'splenty of darkness, "mood", beautiful scenery, and potentiallyinteresting characters, but the three responsible people for thescreenplay must have been working in separate time zones orgeographical locations without being able to contact each other.1) Character commits suicide. 2) Character loses a body part. 3)Characters wander around in the snow or dimly lit interiors. 4)Character can't understand the other because he/she doesn't make sense.5) Suspense is hardly present.If the problem had been the incoherence that permeates most of thefilm, one would have been frustrated but some of the story changes andcharacter substitutions don't make any sense. "Gone With The Wind"managed to be condensed into four hours, without losing its mainpoints. What happened here?This film begs remake because there was something interesting andexciting, dark, and dangerous in its original concept, and it is a pitywhat happened to it.* out of ****(for its beautiful cinematography).
