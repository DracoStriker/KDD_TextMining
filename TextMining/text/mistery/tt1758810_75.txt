A totally disjointed film that has a lot going on, but is poorlyexecuted and leaves you feeling confused and asking yourself why is thekiller so into snowmen for? I'll confess I've not read the book by JoNesbø so maybe it's explained better in the book, but in the film itisn't explained at all. What's even worst, it's pretty obvious who thekiller was from quite early on which I hate. Because half the fun istrying to figure out who's done it. You never really connect to any of the characters either. So whenthey're in danger you don't particularly care and the killer's motivefor doing what he/she were doing was a little thin for my taste.However, I think the biggest problem is the character Harry Hole(Michael Fassbender) the character just doesn't get enough characterdevelopment for my liking. Apparently The Snowman is the seventh bookin the Harry Hole series and that's abundantly clear in this film. Notime was given to give us the audience enough insight into hischaracter so we can understand his motivations and why he is the way heis. I think the film could have done with some of that.Overall, it's not worth your time. They're better films out there youcan spend your two hours on and it's a shame because the premise wasreally good. But sadly, it's wasted on this poorly executed film.
