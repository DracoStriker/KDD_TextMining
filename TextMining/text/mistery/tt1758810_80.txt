I found this film quite a laboured watch. It tended to feel like astomp through knee high snow rather than the slick pacy thriller thetrailer would have you believe it to be. The partnership betweenFassbender and Ferguson feels contrived and as a result fails to growthe emotional capital required to make you feel anything towards theend. I also found the twist too plainly signposted. The stark colourpalette of the film helped emphasise the remote beauty of this film'slocation, but a little distraction might have been welcome. Ultimatelythis film makes you wait a long time for something to happen, and whenit finally does it feels like scant reward for your efforts.
