The first ten minutes are undeniably the best parts of the movie- afterthat you might as well walk out and ask for your full refund at the boxoffice. The only reason I didn't walk out myself is because i was so intriguedas to how they were going to wrap up this whole mess.However i mustgive credit to the beautiful cinematography and almost bearable actingby Fassbender and Ferguson- two of my favourite actors.Where do i start with this review? I'll just list everything that comesto mind starting with the fact that they managed to convince us thateveryone in Norway (where the movie is set) speaks perfect English. Trying so hard to make us believe one person (I won't say who) is thekiller that it actually creates massive loop holes at the end when wecome to find out who the actual killer is. Useless characters who do nothing for the progress of the plot (butjust a side story of what could possibly lead to another movie).The villain killing off a wide range of people- who again make the ploteven more senseless and confusing. I'll be honest I still don'tunderstand the movie and nor do I want to. Finally the ending- you manage to find out who the killer is half waythough the movie but you convince yourself that it's not true as ITDOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE. My only regret after watching the entire movie is not walking out afterthe first ten minutes. Word of advice DO NOT WATCH!!!
