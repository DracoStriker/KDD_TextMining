If you're a fan of Jo Nesbo, don't waste your time on this movie.Except names and building a snowman, nothing is like in the brilliantbook. All important parts are missing, one plot cut and neverexplained, looks totally unnecessary. And I'm very disappointed withHarry's actor, he doesn't look like Harry at all.
