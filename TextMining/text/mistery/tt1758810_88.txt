The snowman was a complete disaster!!! They chose one of the best booksof Nesbo to turn it into a movie and they cut almost the half out of it!! It was just like taking the book and throwing it into a massiveblender they chose some main things from the book and mixed them with aclassic detective thriller movie!! If they wanted to create a new movieseries they should have picked the first novel of the series so someonewho hasn't read the movies could understand things about the maincharacters such as who is Harry Hole what is the connection between himRakel and Oleg!! About the organization of the movie the direction etchvery bad!! The movie starts with random shoots with no point!! Theytried to create an alternative beginning and ending based on the bookbut they ruined everything!! Last but not least was the scene beforethe credits. Those of you who have read the book and are going to watchthe movie will understand me!!
