Based upon Norwegian author Jo Nesbo's 2007 novel of the same name,"The Snowman" follows Oslo police detective Harry Hole as the tries toidentify and apprehend a serial killer who uses the likeness of asnowman as sort of a calling card and trademark image.This is a picture which seems to want to punish the audience forshelling out the money to buy a ticket to see it. Despite a talentedcast and some picturesque Norwegian location photography, it'sdifficult to imagine a more dreary, inaccessible, humorless, oruninvolving movie. Although originally planned to be the first of a series of picturesfeaturing the character of Harry Hole?there are eight titles to date inNesbo's series of books?the filmmakers and producers seemed toanticipate the movie's critical and commercial failure. Shortly after the picture's October 13 European release, director TomasAlfredson candidly blamed the movie's failure on a lack of preparationtime and a short production schedule. According to Alfredson, the shortproduction schedule resulted in some 15% of the screenplay not beingfilmed, causing both inconsistencies and substantial narrativedifficulties in the completed picture.And the reviews for "The Snowman" have been devastating?the RottenTomatoes website reports an approval rating of 9%, based on 116critical reviews. And the CinemaScore market research film reports anaverage audience grade of D for "The Snowman" from a scale of A+ to F,based on exit polls of audiences who viewed the picture.Distributor Universal Pictures originally estimated an opening weekendgross of some $10 million for the picture from 1813 theaters across theUnited States. But after the negative reviews and a discouragingopening day, the projected gross income was adjusted to a morerealistic $4 million.
