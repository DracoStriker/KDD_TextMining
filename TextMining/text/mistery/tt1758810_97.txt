So I listened to the audiobook of this and hated it, but my husbandwanted to see this...so...costing more than our dinner, we went to seeit. Harry Hole is the absolute epitome of "standard cop in a crimenovel/move". Drunk, but brilliant, women love him, but can't be withhim, yada, yada, yada. So now that his ex-girlfriend and her son areliving with another man, he is still in her son's life, but forgetsabout him when there's a big case. Definitely some strange editing choices, meaning that scenes were cutand then we were left wondering why something did or didn't happen,just what??Val Kilmer. Does he really look like or was he made up to look likethat? I was so distracted by his scenery chewing that it was barelyunderstandable what was going on with that aspect of the case. Michael Fassbender is fine as well other performances, except ValKilmer as mentioned above. Although, Michael Fassbender seemed to besleepwalking through it all. Question for someone in Norway. Do houses and buildings really havesuch large windows, including windows between rooms and rooms and thehallway? Seems like nothing good can come of that.There are a couple of minutes of atmosphere that are good. Also, it'stoo bad there aren't more Norwegians as main characters in the movie. For something that Martin Scorcese has his name on, this could be a lotbetter.
