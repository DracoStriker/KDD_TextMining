i cannot believe these ten star comments, first the visuals were mostlyflat, there was no explanation why in this time there were virtually nopeople around, one scene only with about thirty extras, no lights seemsto be on either in the shots were he is flying over the city. moreimportantly you had a very thin plot that could have been told in lessthan an hour. nothing happens for most of the film. it is as if allconcerned were on valium. the music was just noise. talk about ananti-climatic ending, the film just whimpers out. none of the verylittle plot made any sense. so here we have yet again critics ravingabout nothing. an insult to the original in every way. do not wasteyour time or money going to see this. i was going to list the manynon-sensical things in the film but on reflection i don't think thefilm deserves anymore of my time
