They say most sequels (and prequels and remakes) are unwanted andinferior and, in my opinion, they are correct.I still shelled out the quids for Blade Runner 2049 because I rememberwatching it on video years ago and recall having a sense of wonder andamazement. I even proceeded to read the book by Philip K Dick shortlyafter.At over two and a half hours of it this is a true accomplishment: thegraphics and scenes and landscape and colours are amazing andevocative. With that said there is a lot more daylight in this filmthan in the prequel. For some reason the colour orange seems dominant,which is fine perhaps they wanted to impress on us that the setting isa desert and deserted, but overall the futuristic and cyberpunk land isintact.. and beautiful.Also beautiful are the women. The hooker reminded me of the hooker inEyes Wide Shut and she was hot. The girlfriend was hot and even thechief's legs were hot even though I don't go for women with short hair.As a man, the shorter the skirt the more attractive the lady and thisfilm did a stellar job of making me feel happy in that respect, heck, Iwould marry the giant advertisement if I could.Where the story lost me and disappointed was its ending and beginning.Why kill the man who is nothing but a farmer and has been at it for 30years? Why end the film with having killed an operative, but leavingthe arch fiend and his business interests intact and ongoing? I senseyet another sequel coming...
