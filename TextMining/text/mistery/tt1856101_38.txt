Like a junkie that just can't stop himself from reaching for the heroinHollywood executives (all hacks)just.cannot.stop.themselves.from.reaching.for.the.sequel.bottle.It is quite pathetic and not only a waste of time for the audience, butalso occasionally ruins its legendary prequel. Such is the case here.Blade Runner was a fantastic story, based on source material from anaccomplished author and mainly designed by a bona fide futurologist whoworked on the set extensively. It was original, engrossing, moody,thoughtful and full of action. The new one? Well, let me tell you if itweren't for thin shapely legs on a hologram I would not even give it a4.Let's see if this is the year's worst sequel or the coming Star Wars(not that I plan on being a douche and watching that).
