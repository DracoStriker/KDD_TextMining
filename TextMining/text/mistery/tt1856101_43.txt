No, I am not talking about others. I am talking about you. This sequelis currently rated at better and above its prequel, the classic BladeRunner film of 1982. This is partly because so many people are ratingit 10/10. That is right: there are so many people here who think thisfilm is god, it is perfect, not a single iota, not a single scene, nota single note of the soundtrack, not a movement of any actor could beany better. it is perfection. I could tell you that this sequel waswholly unneeded, uncalled for and is another Ridley Scott monthlysequel (that guy now has the credibility of a Harrison Ford which is atthe same level as Marvel or Disney's rapid fire crap output) , but nowe have hundreds of people here who think this sequel is better thantheir mothers and perfect. no wonder people are voting for heads ofstate that laugh at them, steal their money, fart in their faces withconstant lies and then.. get applause, votes and adoration. It is whatpeople deserve. Just look at the bad jokes running Poland, Hungary,Turkey, dump called USA or Russia. never mind the jokester in Japan orthe criminal in Israel.Blade Runner 2049 (yup only 30 years away) has all the nice postapocalyptic unexplained feeling, flying cars, replicants (massproduced) and humans occupying space already (yup 10/10), but alsononsensical lines, robotic acting and a wide open ending that screams'thanks for your ticket purchase. You are not entitled to anything andmost importantly not entitled to a conclusion, but come again!'hey the computer graphics and sets were nice and the call girl waspretty so 3/10.
