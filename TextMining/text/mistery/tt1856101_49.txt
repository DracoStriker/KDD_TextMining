So you are a scifi lover. Then blade Runner comes out, so many critics,reviews such an amazing score on IMDb (8.6), fantastic trailer, greatand promising cast. BUT? There is a big "but" in this whole movie. Whenthe movie starts it is amazing, CGI's are great, fantastic atmosphereof the destructed world of the 2049 keeps you going and everythingseems so interesting. There is one problem, even if though the storyprogresses, there are MANY points which are so slow and dull thatdestroy the whole movie. The movie should have moved forward faster insome points and have more action instead. Most action scenes areamazing but we needed more. At the end of the movie I had a sore buttbecause the movie was long and boring. Sorry but this is the truth.
