I wasn't exactly on fire to see this, but got the opportunity to see itfor free and it hasn't made much of an impression on me. Nothing reallystayed with me in terms of story or performance. It has too manyanomalies and implausibilities not to mention it's fairly mundane inthe way it plays out. WHY would a functional replicant be retired when all the guy was doingwas growing protein on a farm (ya know, for humans?)HOW is it, the hero is a replicant that bleeds and has real childhoodmemories? WHY are the pair running the new Tyrell Corporation dealio so evil?Tyrell himself was a super-powerful but benevolent man which seems tome to be more apropos and more interesting. Why resort to the boringevil megalomaniac cliché? Rachel copy has the wrong color eyes - sothey shoot her in the head on the spot, WHAT? We find out Rachel had a functional womb here but there was no mentionor hint of that in the original Blade Runner. Harrison Ford looked utterly ridiculous and out of place in this,traipsing around in an ironed t-shirt like he's been moving furnitureout to the guest house on a Sunday afternoon or something.
