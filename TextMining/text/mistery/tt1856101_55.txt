What a letdown & massive creative failure.Good: 1: Sylvia Hoeks as LUV. Good looking, cold hearted, ruthless icemaiden. 2: Dystopian atmosphere & set design. 3: Believable decayedfuture Earth setting. 4: Visual FX were seamless although not as prettyas Blade Runner (1982).Bad: 1: Editing was missing in action. Most of the film needed a lotmore editing shots ran for ages which needed trimming. This created anoverblown excessively long movie which was boring for long stretches ofscreen time.I feel asleep at least twice due to how boring it was.2:Directing was very weak from the usually reliable Denis Villeneuve.3:Story was very weak. Actors were given nothing to work with characterwise. 4: Harrison Ford was utterly wasted. He has perhaps 10 min'sscreen time & about 30 lines of unmemorable dialog. Waste of the actorin an extended cameo for about 3 key scenes only.The movie just does not work properly either it needed at least 1 hourediting away to pick the pace up. As it stands now this is a veryforgettable poorly conceived sequel which adds nothing to the original& even takes away a little goodwill due to how poorly this feels as youwatch it unfold at a snail pace.I cannot believe how badly they dropped the ball either it looksperfect but just feels empty as the actors are given nothing to workwith so it does not work at all & deserves to be a massive financialfailure as it does not deserve any box office success.The power of the Hollywood hype machine cannot stop user reviews fromtelling the truth either!!!
