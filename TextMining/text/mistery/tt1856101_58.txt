It was difficult to rate this film as it is visually very impressiveand the story, though not particularly good, did keep my interestthrough the whole 2hrs 45mins. The low score is given for a total lackof character connection, me to them, or even them to each other. Thefirst Bladerunner film has lots of interesting character relationships:Rachael & Deckard (love) Roy & Paris (friendship, mourning) Pris & JFSebastian (friendship, pity, kindness) Leon & Roy (comrades,friendship, leadership) Tyrell & JF Sebastian (companionship) And ofcourse the brief but evocative kinship between Deckard and Roy at theend of Roys life. This film is devoid of character relationships, mostof the characters seem to exist as individual unconnected entities andthat just does not work for a film. There is only one interestingrelationship in Bladerunner 2049 - that between K and Joi, a genuinelyinteresting connection that makes their scenes together the best scenesin the film. Without character connections the film has no grasp onyour emotions and is actually quite depressing to watch. The storythough interesting, develops very slowly, I was expecting some bigtwist that never came. I can't blame the actors for this disappointingfilm as they have to try to act in a vacuum, apart from Jared Leto, whois just awful. I'd also have to say that the visual effects start towear thin after a couple of hours, there's only so many dark shadows/stripy shadows/ reflections of light from water/ more reflections oflight on water / more reflections of light on water I can watch withoutit getting quite formulaic and repetitive. P.s. the film was criticisedfor not having strong female characters but this is not really true, Iwould say 3 of the 4 main characters are female.
