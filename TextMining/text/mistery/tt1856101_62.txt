Who amongst us has not been entertained and received hours and hours ofjoy by Hollywood? The big American studios have given us moments offun, joy and amazement. Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you! you are sirsto us plebs. You are philanthropists to us whores. You are scientiststo us thieves.It is time for us to give back to you (on top of your mansions, libertyto depict brown people as terrorists and freedom to insert as manysubtle Jewish references and characters as you want into each film).You are just not appreciated enough. You are just not thanked enough(we know the cinema chains keep all the revenue from the styrof, er Imean popcorn). I will do my best to give you some masturbatory enjoyment and a respiteof heavenly proportions even if it is for a moment as a sign ofgratitude. So here goes (feel your climax coming):sequelprequelremakerebootfranchiseuniverseseriesoffshootreexaminingre-imaginingHow was it? Was it good for you?? And you didn't even have to pay thecritics to write hyped reviews or send hourly contractors to spam theweb with good reviews. You are welcome madam Kennedy and sirs.As for BR2049: thank-you very much for this sequel. Your responsivenessto the mass demonstrations, petitions, sit-ins, masses clamoring,begging, cajoling and demanding and finally making it is veryappreciated. You are da best!!The film was NOT boring. The film was NOT too long (it had a read goodstory) The film had a definite conclusion justifying my paying $15 towatch it. The film all made sense. The film added something to theBlade Runner story, had better music than Vangelis' and of courseshowed Philip K Dick what he was missing.Oh yeah!-Signed: getting ready to watch the next 10 Star Wars sequels/remakes(that will NOT be boring of course)PS: F originality PPS: FOAD to new ideas PPPS: down and death tocreativity
