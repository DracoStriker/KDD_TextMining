This is proof that lying Trump (I will designate China a currencymanipulator on day one! I will build a beautiful physical wall thatMexico will pay for! Everyone will have health care with betterbenefits for less, Much Less! etc etc) has influenced and taken overHollywood and the professional critics. I guess money talks and thesham billionaire has everyone at his feet.How else do you explain that this cash grab was reviewed as one of thebest sequels, never mind that, best films ever and instead turned outto be slow and boring. It was unneeded and designed to take money fromthe deluded, the desperate and the hopeful and put more cash into thepockets of the rich and the powerful (yup, Trump's tax plan).Just like Trump promising to keep the dreamers safe and quicklychanging his mind or being all "great" for LGBTQ and then banning themfrom the military we were promised a beautiful film that excites andasks questions like the prequel did, but instead had an unsatisfactorybeginning and an unresolved end.
