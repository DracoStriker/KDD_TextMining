Once upon a time a splendid science fiction movie showed up in thetheaters, based on the intelligent novel of the great writer Philipp K.Dick: Blade Runner! Although deservedly very successful, this uniquemasterpiece remained untroubled by any unnecessary sequel for 35 years.Meanwhile the science fiction genre has moved on. Very nice approachesshowed up concerning AI, such as 'Ex Machina' and 'Her'. When theoriginal 'Blade Runner' picked up the subject, long after the godfatherof AI movies 'Metropolis' (1927) by Fritz Lang, it created anoutstanding breathtaking cutting-edge vision of a future at stake,which needed not a single frame, a single word, a single tone more tohave its role perfectly played. To show up with a sequel to a masterpiece is certainly a high risk.Almost all attempts have failed. This one failed completely as much asnone of all sequels before have failed that I have seen. In fact iteven has failed to be a mean movie at all when excluding the attempt ofbeing a sequel: Reams of illogical settings and acting, poor dialogues,no pace, unimaginative landscapes, incoherent music, partly implausibleroles, a dystopia where the questions of AI are odd an contrived. And,maybe the worst in case of a boring movie is: the length. To copy a great idea, to staple together some actors, frames and tonesdoesn't make a movie for a long time yet. This a failing movie as amovie and a disaster as a sequel. All in all I would recommend to everyone who loved the original andconsiders to go to cinema for this movie: Save your time! Rather getthe original and watch that one, again and again, and you're muchbetter off! While even after 35 years I still enjoy to remember every scene of'Blade Runner', the scenes of '2049' will be forgotten next week, atthe latest. Fortunately.
