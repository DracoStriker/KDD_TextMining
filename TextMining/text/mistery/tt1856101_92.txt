After seeing Alien: Covenant and (over the weekend) Blade Runner 2049,I have lost a lot of respect for Ridley Scott. I feel all he does iswash, rinse and repeat the same ideas over and over and over again,without a fresh idea in his head. In the Alien series (for example),how many times can we watch a bunch of space cowboys land on an alienplanet and get infected by an alien (or xenomorph-like) virus? WithBlade Runner 2049, the "long-buried secret that has the potential toplunge what's left of society into chaos" is procreation amongReplicants. Are you serious? This concept has been exhausted endlesslyin science fiction over in past 20 plus years! Largely, duringBattlestar Galactica, the 2004 television series, procreation amonghumans and human Cylons. I also remember seeing something very simularwhen I was a kid, back in the early 90s, in SeaQuest, procreation amongtheir version of Replicants, known as G.E.L.F, genetically engineeredlifeforms. All these ideas were cool back in the 80s and 90s, butseriously, are movies today completely incapable of keeping up with thetimes! God, it's frustrating! Blade Runner 2 really deserved better! Ifeel it's the same with Star Wars right now, I mean, how many times canthe Rebel Alliance destroy a Death Star? We're on 4 times now. Why arewe incapable of coming up with any fresh ideas for film?If you want to see a good film (and enjoy movies like Guardians of theGalaxy 1 and 2) go see Thor: Ragnarok instead and have a laugh. BladeRunner 2049 is a wait to see on DVD!
