Blade Runner 2049 of course came with its own expectations and a barthat was set quite high. I was drawn in by the promise of thatuniverse, the graphics and the giant holographic woman and was notdisappointed. The CGI and the building, as well as the beautiful womenwere what I expected. I wish I had a 'wife' that pretty.Unfortunately, again the bar was set high, but this film did notdeliver. There are too many loose ends and the film does not give theaudience a conclusion. The major surprise regarding replicants and whatthey can do is also a bridge too far. I do agree that the film is slow,which coupled with the lack of a conclusion brings my rating down.6/10
