Executive producer Ridley Scott is British and director DenisVilleneuve and main actor Ryan Gosling are Canadians. It makes zerodifference. This is a movie made by hacks with terrible writing.You figure (you hope) that foreigners go to Hollywood and make itbetter and bring something new to the table. Nope, isn't happening. Itproves that these guys are just hacks and the head of the studio is thepuppet master. Now I am sure none of these guys are as big a hacks andplagiarists and unoriginal schmucks as Jar jar Abrams, but thearrogance to remake Blade Runner (it needed a sequel like I need mywife to nag some more), the long long long dragging plot and themeaningless and superficial lines had me daydreaming and alternatelydozing off.At least there was a beautiful woman in this film and she had legs Icould admire. Since there is 100% chance that there will be a sequel tothis (Hollywood is an addict) let's make it about her. What? She wasdeleted. Oh come on, this is Hollywood. She can come back (as aghost,as a backup copy, her twin sister is in town, etc.)
