I really was afraid that I would snore in the theater, while the movieplayed on. This new film copies and rips off scenes from the originalwith gleeful abandonment and interjects modern cinematography for avery thin and predictable story. It felt as if shading the movie wouldcure all the boring parts and we would gasp with wonder. The originalromance was palpable between Decker and the girl. Here in this film Ifelt nothing. Lots of heavy lasers, special effects and the dreadedCGI. That grimness of the original was missing. Instead this film feltlike everybody had moved to better digs. Hell, even the Chinatownscenes weren't as convincing as the original. And then my biggestgripe. They replaced Vangelis to give us absolutely earth shatteringbass that any generic synthesizer in the hands of a child would make.No memorable dialogues like the original either. "If only you could seewhat my eyes have seen" if I remember correctly among other samplesthat I used in my trance music production. Straight up unemotional andthe ending entirely ludicrous. The human touch was missing and Goslingand the faded Ford refused to impress with their woody dialogues. Theoriginal remains King.
