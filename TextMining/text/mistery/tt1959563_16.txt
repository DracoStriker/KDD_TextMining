I have to say I was really really looking forward to the movie afterwatching the trailer when it came out. But the movie didn't justify thelong wait and the end product had a way too generic plot andstorytelling. Well we all know we have to shut down a few million braincells while watching and not bother about the story and logic but stillthe lameness here sticks out way too much. The way too digital filmquality sticks out like a sore thumb, its like the entire video and thecharacters were Botox-ed all over after the filming was done. And ittries too hard to balance the seriousness with logical explanations andthe comedy that in the end both fails. Like I mentioned in the title,this is one of those movies for which the purpose is to serve only as acool trailer while scourging for new movies to check out in YouTube,only that you shouldn't really check it out in the end.
