This movie basically portrays the nation of Belarus as a terroriststate. There is actually a scene where a truck full of explosives plowsinto a crowd of people. Given the fact this has been used a method tocommit real terrorist acts across Europe in recent years, it isabsolutely shameful they would add this into the movie. If you'reeastern European, Belarusian particularly, this movie seems like anattack on you.
