I think this reviewer summed it up nicely: It's a Netflix movie soeveryone knows what that means at this point:Interracial relations, beta white male bait, racism, strong dominantgenius gender quotas for female bosses and more or less lead, supposedto match the acting experience of an evil white racist villain, theblack hero and the bait. Mixed with Netflix algorithms that tells whatpeople "like" for each genres.If you like cliché after cliché, "motherfucker" after "motherfucker"couple friendly i.e. female friendly watered down action with an eyecandy bait for them to be okay to watch it, while the boyfriend hopesJackson says a sentence without "motherfucker" pushed into the script.This is the movie for you, especially if you have never seen a moviebefore.1 out of 10 points out of respect for Jackson. The good days are behindyou, but it's not your fault.
