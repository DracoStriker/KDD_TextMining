As some other reviews stated the chemistry between Samuel L. Jacksonand Ryan Reynolds was so good I want to see more. The writers gave usgreat banter between the two men. This would be a great series ofmovies. While I can understand the characters probably use the languagethat is pervasive throughout the movie, I could use it toned down abit. If you like action pack movies, this is one for you.
