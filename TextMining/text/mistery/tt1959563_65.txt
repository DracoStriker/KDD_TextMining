This movie is about as good as the genre gets. If you are looking for aheavy drama, a social conscience kind of movie or one that will winawards, what are you doing in this action comedy/buddy kind of movie?For the kind of flick it is, it is great! It tons of action, of course.Plenty of fun interspersed throughout, especially if you layer in theactor's involved. (They are clearly having fun with it.) Some romanceand even some higher ideals/messages if you choose to buy in a bit.Selma Hayek's character is roll on the floor laughing fun.Good fun kind of movie.
