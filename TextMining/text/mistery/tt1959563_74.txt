I walked into the movie expecting a good time and a few laughs howeverthis went above and beyond my expectations this is truly one movie notto be missed you walk out of the theater feeling like you know you hada good time that's only happened to me with two other comedies so farthis year 'rough night& guardians 2'i had such fun and laughed so hardduring this movie it was incretibly intelligent yet simple tounderstand my only caution is if your offended by f bombs stay awayfrom this movie and also keep kids away but aside from that grab somepopcorn and your favorite soda and have a nice night at the movies
