Why can't anyone just sit back, turn their brains off and enjoy a movieanymore? Does EVERY movie need to be Jason Bourne or some sort of crazytwisty-turny thriller or something?When you saw Deadpool did you enjoy it? Was it an amazing Xmen movie orwas it because of action and Ryan Reynold's personal brand of comedy?This movie is great. You get the genius acting and bonus comedy of atleast two A list stars, with cameos from at least one other, and acouple decent B listers too. Is it predictable? Sure. But is it stillentertaining? You bet. Stop trying to Siskel and Ebert every movie and just enjoy it?
