I left theater thinking average (5 of 10) but my family apparentlyenjoyed it more and said 7-8 so I bumped up this review to 6. Plentyfoul-mouthed humor so be prepared. Action scenes almost James Bod-likeunrealistic but entertaining. There is definitely a chemistry betweenJackson and Reynolds where I could see them hooking up for futureprojects.Hayek definitely showed range and some action star potential (but weprobably should accept it was most likely body double/stunt women).Plot ridiculous and law enforcement made to look less competent whichalways is sad for them. Even military involvement looked rookie likewhich is designed to make stars (and worse, the "Bad Guys) look morecapable and society is at their mercy, sigh...Don't expect much and just enjoy for entertainment; ideally you'll goto matinée so you can accept mediocrity provided.
