Everyone seems to be writing here that the casting was great: I have todisagree. Samuel L Jackson is 68 and, although he doesn't look his age,neither does he look like an action hero who can run around and leapfrom building to building, with or without and gunshot in his leg.Obviously this movie is very far from realistic, but from the momentJackson jogged into the action waggling a machine gun behind him I feltunconvinced. Other than that my main criticism would be the uneven toneof the film and, of course the paper thin plot.If you are just looking for something to kill a few hours with, this isnot the worst choice you could make, but there are certainly a lot ofbetter films out there if you want something with a plot and gooddialogue.
