As the summer movie season comes to an end Hollywood gives us one lastaction/adventure film that is driven by star power; The Hit-man'sBodyguard starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. Reynolds playsMichael Bryce, an anal retentive hit-man who is strictly by the books;while Samuel L. Jackson is Darius Kincaid, an assassin who flies by theseat of his pants however; his style seemingly makes him bulletproof.The fun, and a whole lot of killing, begins when Reynolds getsthe assignment to be Jackson's bodyguard and The two world classhit-man set out on a trek to get Kincaid to a world tribunal to testifyagainst a dictator (Gary Oldman) who is accused of war crimes, buteveryone who's previously tried to testify against him has ended updead.The two lead characters could not be any more different. Reynolds, whowas heartbroken by his previous relationship with a secret agent, isjaded and bitter while Jackson's character is married to another hiredkiller (Salma Hayek), who is currently doing time, is a romantic, lovestruck fool who takes to singing loves songs at the drop of a dime. He's also prone to dropping the "MF" word. (There are more MF's inthis movie than in any other I can recall since Pulp Fiction.) MF's aside, this is one funny film. It's in the tradition ofclassic "buddy movies" like Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours. The contrast ofthe two main characters make for some serious comedic moments. Thejokes make for a smooth transition from the car chase scenes andviolence. The Hit-man's Bodyguard never takes it's foot off the gas.The movie goes at full throttle from beginning to end. It is aseriously fun movie!The film is rated "R" for violence and harsh language and it has a runtime of 1 hour and 58 minutes (which passes very quickly). On my"Hollywood Popcorn Scale" I rate it a JUMBO!Hollywood Hernandez
