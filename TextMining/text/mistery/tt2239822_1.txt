The first thing I want to say about this movie is that the visuals areabsolutely insane! It's really a joy to watch, the aliens are extremelywell made and the first scene is just gorgeous! The story is predictable, but can keep you interested for most of thetime. The main problem was the way things are explained, it's like themovie think that the viewers are not intelligent enough, and many timesI found myself saying "well that was obvious". There are some scenesthat have zero impact on the story, and they give you nothinginteresting. I really wanted to know more about this world, about thespecies, but sadly that didn't happen. The dialog is good but nothing exiting, sometimes they say the samestuff over and over and you may find yourself thinking "we get it, moveon", and it's really cheesy at some points. The acting is very good, the chemistry between Dane DeHaan and CaraDelevingne is great, and overall all the cast delivers.This movie wasn't something amazing as I thought it would be judging bythe trailers, but I still enjoyed it very much, the actions scenes weregreat and the humor was on point most of the time. I won't recommendthis for those who look for something clever with breathtaking twists,but for those who enjoy solid acting, nice story and amazing visuals,this movie is definitely recommended. Overall 7/10 Thanks for reading!
