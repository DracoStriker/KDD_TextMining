I am a big sci-fi fan and I love a good big budget movie butunfortunately I was very disappointed with this film.It has great CGI effects but this does not save the wooden acting anddire script which I watched with my wife throughout the film. I enjoyedthe Fifth Element and the other films the director made but this moviejust never got going for me.Its like the movie was trying to copy some of the other great films outthere like Avatar, Guardians of the Galaxy etc. but never tried tocreate its own unique style.Sadly I could not emphasis with the 2 main actors and they both looked2 young for their roles within this movie when older actors probablywould of done a better job.I lost the bet with my son who said I would not enjoy the movie and hewas absolutely right which is a real shame as the movie could of beenvery good if the script was better, better actors and the CGI effectwere played down a bit.
