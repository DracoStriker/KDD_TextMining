Saw this film today in a discount theater. Worth the $2.50, but wouldhave been disappointed at Saturday night date prices. The acting by thetwo principle characters (Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne) was oftenhackneyed and painful to watch. Part of the pain wasn't just theactors, it was the very clichéd dialog. It wasn't all bad, but therewere several scenes that would have benefited from a second (or fifth)take. The rest of the characters were about what one would expect from asci-fi flick with a couple of pretty faces as the leads. The specialeffects and CGI were all terrific. The beach planet Mul was nicely doneas were the inter-dimensional chase scenes and space battles. There was a very loose thread in the plot where the Major Valeriancharacter makes an enemy with a Jaba the Hut type smuggler and thetension was never resolved -maybe that will be a sub plot (or theentire plot) of a sequel. It's not Shakespeare, the eye candy effects are good, the pole dance byRihanna is very hot, and you have a couple of bucks to burn on a rainyafternoon it's worth the time.
