Special effects were great and the story was fair, but neither couldmake up for the horrible acting. The two main characters had zerochemistry, and seemed completely unable to emote literally anything. Idon't know if that was the director's intent, but it would have beenbetter with anybody with any charisma at all in those two roles. Verydisappointing, as I love sci Fi in general and was so looking forwardto this one.
