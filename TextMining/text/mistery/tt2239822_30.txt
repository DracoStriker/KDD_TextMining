2 hours of an 8 minute loop of film. I don't get it. did the writerhave nothing to do? Did the producer have money to burn? Did the actorsleave because there was no plot.This and many other questions I was left with. In the end I decided the sole reason this movie was made was to makeeveryone sick of the song Major Tom.
