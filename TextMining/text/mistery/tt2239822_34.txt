Decided to ignore the lackluster critic reviews and saw Valerian andthe City of a Thousand Planets tonight at the movie theater. Bottomline......this movie is downright brilliant! It has a great, fast-pacedplot, stunning visuals, and the acting is great! I can't even fathomwhy anyone would give this movie a bad review. Go see it...this is Sci-Fi at its best people!!!!
