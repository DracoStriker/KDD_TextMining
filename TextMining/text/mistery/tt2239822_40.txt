Major movie critics got this one very, very wrong. Or maybe right ifyou consider they are prostitutes that shill for Hollywood and this wasa French production. I saw this in real 3d, and recommend others do also. It's clear from the first 15 minutes that this story was the originalsource material for George Lucas's Star Wars, and after watching StarWars story was a pathetic attempt to copy an original work. Thecharacter universe is very deep and among the best graphical effectsever created anywhere. The main characters, while not the typicalAmerican hero types, bring something else more intangible to thescreen, which is free of the Feminist and PC nonsense that plague somany other movies. Clive Owen's character had real character flaws without being amythological evil character such as Hitler. There is too muchincomprehensible evil in cinema and this was a break from that. Very, very refreshing and I will be buying the Blue Ray. I hope thisfilm gets the love it deserves internationally and Luc will continue tomake follow ups in the series, especially now that it should be morecost effective now the main universe has already been created.
