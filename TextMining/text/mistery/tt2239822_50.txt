'Valerian' is the name of the hero in this story. That's the onlyspoiler I'm offering in this review as I came to the movie ignorant ofthe astounding world I was about to enter and totally enjoyed gettingsucked in. I feel IMAX 3D is the only way to experience all this. Ifound my head turning to all parts of the screen - so beautiful andvertigo-producing were the visuals! Not only is there a virtual bustour in the story, plus Rihanna, but heart- pounding chases which I'msure would all feel so diluted in 2D view. What a refreshing change tonot have to sit through more re-cycled American super heroes saving theuniverse from savage invaders/aliens. Acting is great apart from CliveOwen being one dimensional over-the-top evil, and nice to see EthanHawke in a brief but memorable cameo. Congrats to Luc Bresson fordazzling yet again with his stunning imagination and direction.
