First, I am a very huge fan of the comics "Valerian et Laureline" whichis one of the master piece that educated the boy I am today. And I mustadmit that I was quite afraid of this adaptation when I enter thetheater. But at the end I was happy because the movie even if notperfect and not a master piece made me remember tgood time and do itwell. So I don't know if for people who don't know the comics they willappreciate this movie, But I think they could because, a lot of aspectwere modify to "show off action during that film" transforming thecomics of course but not in a bad way. Besson love that commics and Isaw it. In the end That's all the important matter to me.
