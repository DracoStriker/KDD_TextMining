Admittedly I don't expect everyone to like it as some folks just wantanother tony stark or Chris Evans film, Or they same old same old thathas been spam handed to use for decades. And they are all fun moviesbut this one is different, just as FIFTH ELEMENT was. A huge fan ofFantasy and Sci-fi art I'd see online and at Comi-con, I've always saidto myself wouldn't that be great to see in a film. FIFTH ELEMENT was asclose as we got to it, then we went right back to the same old stuff wealways do, Cause Disney knows all they gotta do is slap a picture of aTie-fighter on a box and they'll make billions, regardless of what'sinside the box and its getting old....like 2005 old. Then this filmcomes along and right off the get go I was hooked. It had the actionthat I liked about STAR WARS, Alien diversity I liked about STAR TREK,however instead of some stupid doomsday weapon or world conqueringploy. There central theme and message is far more interesting andimporting what is "love" really mean, trust, forgiveness, loyalty,vulnerability, also the complexities of a lie. Even when I thought theywere pushing a tense moment, I thought for dramatics it was just totake a sec and get that message out there and make our centralcharacter understand what was really at stake. Regardless how othersfeel, I am so glad that this film is now in existence, and I lookforward to owning it. My hats off to the people who did it cause I wasthoroughly impressed. Even if they had a SFX moment like all Sci-Fi'sthey would use this special kinda of restraint that so many othersfailed to do. And was more of a hand over mouth "WOW". I truly Lovedthis film.
