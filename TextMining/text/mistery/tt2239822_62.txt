I don't see why this isn't doing better at box office? It's a romp andthe story is quite clear. I thought the main characters were finetogether and they played their parts well.I loved the scenery and the imagined worlds, also the odd twists andturns. I suspect it is disliked because of the anti-war messages.But what is it really? It's Saturday Matinée non-stop fun, with apositive romantic ending. Too saccharine? Not gritty enough? Give me abreak.Grab some popcorn, enjoy the ride.
