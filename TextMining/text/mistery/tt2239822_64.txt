As usual, a movie that critics bash I end up liking.The opening gives you the picture - this is not a space shoot em upwhere the humans have to defeat the evil aliens like so many spacemovies have done over and over. This movie sets up its own universe ina very creative way. It really makes you want to get out there and be apart of it, visit the beautiful opening planet or even travel to theinternational space station and interact with the hundreds of alienspecies.A lot of reviews I read have a shot at the lead actors performances. Ithink this is more a case of people expecting either an action hero ora likable rogue as just about every sci-fi movie has those but you getneither in this one. Don't get me wrong you do get action scenes,fights and shoot outs but you don't see the leads as invincible killingmachines. The one liners Valerian tries on Laureline often fall flatbecause lets face it Valerian does not look like the typical moviealpha male and she is playing hard to get. Its got nothing to do withthe chemistry between the actors. In fact I find it more realistic thatshe does not swoon at the "hero" just because he looks her way afterall she is a hero herself.Not wanting to give the story away I will leave it at that and just sayto really enjoy this one don't compare or expect stereotypes just relaxand enjoy.
