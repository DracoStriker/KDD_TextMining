Valerian is a great watch, especially on 3-d. That cannot be denied.The movie has great pace, good action sequences, edgy, punky, funnymain characters that don't look too slick, as is so often the case inHollywood's big movies, but still or maybe because of that have goodcharisma. Their coolness, arrogance and sarcasm are very refreshing.The story could do better, but hey, it's difficult to keep all theapples in the basket, when you're on so wild a ride as Luc Bessonoffers you. But of course the main character of this movie isL'IMAGINATION. In this case the French version of the word, because themovie is the outcome of one man's vision. The imagination is limitless,the creativity unbridled, no effort was spared to give us a full, vastvision of the universe of Valerian, some 7 centuries from now. It'spretty obvious that Luc Besson had almost full carte blanche in therealization of his dream, which is good to keep in mind while watchingthe movie. For a change we aren't looking at a pre-meditated,box-office driven, risk-free effort to make a lot of money. We arelooking at an alternative effort to make a box-office hit, with a morepersonal vision, also more individualistic, maybe more European? Keepthat in mind when reading the negative reviews, especially from theAmerican reviewers. I loved the movie and, without getting my hopes up,see it paving the way for a different, more unpredictable story-tellingon the blockbuster front. And I think a lot of people, fed up with thesuper-heroes mania, with me.
