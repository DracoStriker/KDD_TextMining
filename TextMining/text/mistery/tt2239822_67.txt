I went to see VALERIAN, this past Sunday afternoon, because of theadvance hype I saw in the trailers. Namely, that part of the creativeteam responsible for the success of THE FIFTH ELEMENT had worked onthis. But, I ended up feeling let down for a variety of reasons. In terms of 3-D CGI, this looks like a rip-off of AVATAR. In terms of story, it sounds like a plagiaristic cross between THEFIFTH ELEMENT and STAR WARS.In terms of mixing drama with comedy? Cara Delevigne had more chemistrywith her co-star in PAPER TOWNS. And the only part I laughed at waswhen Rihanna's character accidentally dropped that crown on Laureline'shead!With regard to Dane Dehaan in the title role? He looks like Jason Behrand tries to act like Harrison Ford. But, the resemblance to the formerin no way gives him the acting ability of the latter.Add all that to the fact that I was only one of _half a dozen_ peoplewho were in the theater for the 3-D showing...and you've got anambitious big budget film that is most likely going to be one of thissummer's biggest box office flops.
