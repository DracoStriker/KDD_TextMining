If we were to travel to the future, we would be entering into a worldwhere a lot of customs, technology and politics would be unfamiliar tous. The beauty of Valerian is that it doesn't flinch from allowing theaudience to feel disoriented in the way we should feel encountering analien and futuristic world. Very little exposition is provided orneeded, and it is enthralling to be transported to a state of mindwhere nothing is explained, but everything makes sense. Luc Besson returns to the mindset that drove his first film Le DernierCombat, a feature with zero dialogue. Pure cinematic storytelling.
