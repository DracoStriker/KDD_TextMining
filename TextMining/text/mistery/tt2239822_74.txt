It seems that the critics have decided to gun down every big project ofLuc Besson. They thrashed Lucy which was actually a good movie and nowValerian. I went to see the movie after reading these weird reviews ofthese so called critics. It turns the movie is great space opera with agood story and I enjoyed every minute of it. Those who try to compareit with the comics (read them all, i'm a big fan) are making amistake...this is a free adaptation of the comics. I highly recommend you go and see it...it is much better thanTransformers and as good...maybe even better than Guardians of thegalaxy. Certainly much better than the last Star Wars.
