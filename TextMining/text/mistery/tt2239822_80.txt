Luc Besson has an eye for visuals. That's my takeaway from this movieof his. But - as is the case with practically every bad movie - it hadpotential.The film is based on a French comic book series that ran for 43 (!)years. So there was a lot of material to work from. But the story ispresented in a very uninteresting way, the script is atrocious and theacting is... well, it's like the script. Mostly, it's not the actors'fault, though. Except in the case of Cara Delevingne. No facialexpression, not a single change of tone in her voice... Other actorsare more believable selling car insurance than she is here. When I saythat she was the standout in the movie it is not at all a compliment.But at least the others tried... even though they had little to workwith.The only redeeming quality - for me at least - is the visualrepresentation of the world the movie tries to establish. The CGI isstunning, might even prompt some awards. Of course it's only myopinion, I'm no expert when it comes to VFX.The bottom line is that I didn't care about the story or thecharacters, but, boy, is it pretty to look at. Sadly, it's not nearlyenough. It's only visual porn if I don't feel invested in thecharacters or the story.Where is the director The Fifth Element? Or Léon: The Professional?This is all fluff, no substance.
