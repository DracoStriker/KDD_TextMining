Another good Jean Luc Besson movie. The movie is very faithful to thebook. Visually it is a stunning movie and for those who read the bookswill be screaming for another movie. Sometimes the rhythm of the linesand also some scenes may be a little slow for a movie, but not thatslow to make it boring. The action scenes have enough action and arenot overwhelming. Cara Delevingne was very well casted for the role,but Dane DeHaan looks a bit too young for the role, nevertheless does agood job. Too bad Rutger Hauer only had 10 secs of movie time. Theintro of the movie is amazing and eagerly waiting for the bluray tocome out. All in all a good movie to see.
