Adapted from Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mézières long-runningFrench sci-fi comics series Valérian And Laureline. Luc Besson createsa stunning visual feast. Besson's attention to detail is immaculate.And that along side the quirky dialog's between Laureline and Valerianare what keep this film afloat. I might be in the minority, but Iprefer my films to be lengthy. However in this case, Valerian feelsoverstuffed trying to add more depth to the story at every turn. Thisfilm might have benefited from a shorter run time. The biggest surprisewas Laureline(Delevingne), her character is what kept my interestthroughout the film and her acting was actually on point. As someonewho was skeptical about her casting, I'm glad to be proved wrong. Notsaying it's her breakout performance, Just saying she's improving andperhaps she might have a future as an actress. Everyone deserves asecond chance.Grade: B-
