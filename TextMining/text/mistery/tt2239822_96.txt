MAYBE some spoiler leakage but nothing very specific.Edit: After some thought, I think I was initially too harsh (one star).There is, after all, a sub-theme of peaceful coexistence andreconciliation. Which is good for kids to see. Also, themulti-dimensionality is something that may really exist in this'reality' and is slowly being leaked into the masses as a form ofpredictive programming (getting the public "acclimated" to thinkingabout it). Just a theory. It's just too bad that the dialog andsoundtrack were so banal, hoaky, unintelligent etc. Don't worry,whatshisname director, kids can handle it. Still think you got co-optedby holly weird though.Tired plot. A mash of Star Wars, Starshop Troopers, Avatar etc. Some ofthe CIA future tech and cityscapes were interesting (hmmmm) but overallit is just a huge waste. It's hard to believe the same guy directedLucy which is one of my fav SF movies of all time. Different types ofscifi but still, you would think he/they/it would progress but this is20 times backwards. Whatshisname must be living in holly wood, hangingout with "Weinstein" and drinking the tap water. Sickening anddisgusting people.
