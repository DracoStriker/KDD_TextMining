When the fifth element came out i remember news channels reporting thatthe film bombed in the US. Valérian et la Cité des Mille Planètes seemsto take the same path. Just like the fifth element at the time, i lovedthis one too. The way Besson tells stories with big visual effects isdifferent than regular US blockbusters, that's why some people can'tenjoy it. Because they want to see the same movie over and over again.Valérian et la Cité des Mille Planètes is a great because it's more anadventure film than an action film and i really hope there are more tocome.
