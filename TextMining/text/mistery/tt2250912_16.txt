Let me start by saying Spider-Man Homecoming is an absolute blast. It'severything you could want from a Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland did afantastic job as Spider-Man. He was an interesting, lovable PeterParker and an absolutely classic Spider-Man. Michael Keaton was anexceptional vulture. You couldn't ask for a better actor to play him.This also had a lot of very comedic moments so if you enjoy comedies,this would be a good movie to see. This is how Spider-Man should alwaysbe. Lovable, funny, kind of awkward and witty and that's exactly whatwe get from this movie that we didn't fully get in The AmazingSpider-Man movies. I noticed some people were comparing to Spider-Man 2and saying which one was better. I think they are both awesome but theyare also very different in certain ways. Overall, this is a fun flickfor the whole family to watch. Not much more you could have asked for.
