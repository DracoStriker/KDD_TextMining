I've read a few reviews and I understood a few complaints especially ifyou were a 90s kid and haven't been keeping up with all the reboots andwhatnot of Spiderman. Toby's Spiderman in 2002 was more of "Spidermanthe animated series" version of the 90s. If you only remember thatspider-man this movie could be kind of disappointing. Me on the otherhand, I've been keeping up with all my superheroes that interest me,with spider-man being my favorite, I've been watching the UltimateSpiderman. He crosses over with the avengers a few episodes, even getsinvited to join the avengers down like he was in the movie and turnedit down. In the cartoon, Shield gives him all of his gadgets and Ironman gives him this Iron man Spider suit. In the movie, Tony stark isresponsible for all of his gadgets. The story is a little different butit works for me. I enjoyed watching the spider-man who actually is akid unlike other spider-man movies. I expected more from this movie butit still was a 10 out of 10. I think that this movie sets up the nextspider-man movie and even sets up the avengers movie maybe. The onething i probably felt was just totally wrong in this movie is theportrayal of flash Thompson. That was very disappointing. Where is thenot so smart High school Jock, not this guy that is supposedly one ofthe fastest in the school (athleticism) but is on a debate team??GTFOH. only disappointment.
