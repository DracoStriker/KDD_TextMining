this was the best spider-man movie i have seen in a long time but whyis it the best because it is grounded in the why it tells of peterstruggles with being spider-man and how he trying to cope with it plusit is not about the iron man at all yes he is key to the plot but itmainly focuses on spidy plus the cast is amazing and make this a muchwatch summer blockbuster.
