Tom Holland's first spider-man film has me anxious for more from thenew marvel hero. The acting was fantastic and hands down the bestspider man movie yet. Micheal Keaton did fantastic as Vulture andalthough Bokeem Woodbine was a smaller role as shocker he did a greatjob. This movie finally gives us a MARVEL spider-man that actuallytakes place inside the marvel universe. The scene with the MJ reference,although being a cool little quirk, could've been left out do to thefact the characters name is Michelle but hey what can you do. Thismovie is the spider-man I have been wanting my whole life, definitelyworth a watch and really looking forward to more.
