This is the first time i am posting a review on IMDb just because of mysheer love for spidey and now Spider-Man: Homecoming.This movie belongs to Tom Holland in and out. He is was amazing asPeter Parker and Spider-Man (no pun intended). And Vulture was one ofthe best villain in recent CBM. He was grounded and scary at the sametime. Also, the supporting casts were brilliant, specially Ned as thechair guy.RDJ worked as a proper mentor for Spidey and you can feel how he haschanged after AoU and Civil War.And for the action, it was mind blowing. The swinging, different webshooting combination, TASER WEBS, I can go on and on and on. The scenewhere Peter was stuck under the rubble, that scene itself made themovie worth.Highly recommended.
