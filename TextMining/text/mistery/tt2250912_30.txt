Perhaps the best spider-man movie yet. No doubt, Holland did a greatjob portraying the character. We get to see the life of Peter Parker asan actual high school kid and how he deals with all theresponsibilities and be spider-man at the same time. It is a must watchmovie, whether you are a comic book reader, spider-man fan or simply agood movie lover. We get to see Vulture for the first time on screenand he really challenges Peter to sacrifice for the greater good. Handsdown, one of the best movie ever made.
