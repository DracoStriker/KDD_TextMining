There was nothing wrong or bad about this movie. It was witty, comicaland funny, and had many twists and turns along the way as well. I havebeen a big fan of Spider- Man for years and it was honestly better thanthe Spider-Man movies starring Tobey Maguire and much better than theAmazing Spider-Man movies starring Andrew Garfield. It stuck to itscomical roots; Spider-man is just a young kid trying to prove himself.The Amazing Spider-man series focused too much on the action and triedto make the movie look cooler in 3-D and did not focus on thestory-line too much. Homecoming had a perfect blend of action, drama,and story-line and that is what makes this movie great. Go grab a popcorn and watch it in the cinema and have a blast!
