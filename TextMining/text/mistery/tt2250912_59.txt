I am a huge fan of Spiderman, I love the original trilogy (yes even thethird one) I really liked Tobey Maguire and felt he did a great job. Ithink the Andrew Garfield films, while enjoyable, really lacked thetone of a Spiderman film. So I can tell you, this was easily my mostanticipated movie of 2017, but I do have to remember that I can't keepmy expectations as high as a drug addict. So as the film started, whilepumped, I also was just praying it would be awesome. So... I AM VERYHAPPY TO TELL YOU THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!! The entire timewatching it I had a smile on my face! ? First off the acting is great,Tom Holland was born to play this role. All his friends, the villains,and of course Robert Downey Jr did awesome like always. Next theaction, the web swinging sequences, the high flying fighting andintensity was all handled so well, Marvel always achieves greatnesswith that. You can really feel the brutality and fear of the characterswhile watching. Let's talk about Micheal Keaton as the vulture wow!What an incredible villain! He was very intimidating with the suit onbut also, a terrific character underneath the suit. While I am a fan ofthe MCU I do agree, a majority of their villains suck. But Keatonreally was different. He had so much depth and motivation which Iadored. And there is one big shocker towards the end which even putmore emotional weight towards his character. This movie is not justanother marvel movie. Spiderman Homecoming is very unique and specialin its own way. Of course the CGI was great like always. The story waswritten in a way we can all adore. There are so many twists and turnsand unexpected paths it chooses to take which was the right direction.And last, the humor was hilarious! Laughter is the best medicine.Peter's friend Ned was a addition that fit like Cinderella's slipper.Spiderman Homecoming is definitely the best Spiderman movie to date andI say you definitely should go out and see this one!
