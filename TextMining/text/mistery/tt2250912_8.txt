I saw Spider-Man Homecoming on the opening night of the movie,and itsmy favorite Spider Man movie since the 2nd Spider Man movie from theoriginal series.Tom Holland who plays as Spider Man in the MarvelCinematic Universe does a terrific job on being passed the mantle ofplaying Spider Man.Michael Keaton also does a great job as playing asthe main bad guy of the movie Vulture.The new take on Spider Man of notbeing dark and gritty its nice to see for a change.And I have a feelingthat Tom Holland will keep impressing me on his performance as SpiderMan in future Marvel movies.
