Worst movie EVER!!!! I can't believe this is what people like. Zerostars for this garbage. The movie is plain, dull, boring, made nosense, weak story-line, characters were not likable, and too long. Howlong is this, because I was pulling on my hair! ALERT, BEYOND THISPOINT - "CONTAINS SPOILER" - Why does Spiderman throw bottled up web,that you can purchase through Ebay? Spiderman's body is suppose to makeweb naturally! Was this movie intended for 12 year old kids ONLY? I amnot racist, but why was this movie turned into a Multiracial film?Enough with the White & Black couples!!! I don't like it at all, it'sokay once in a while to see this, but this has gone overboard, thereare White & Black couples in EVERY MOVIE NOW! Why in the world is MaryJane Black???? What a turn off! I don't want to see this. Also, why,why, why there always has to be a comment about Black people "thatblack slaves build the Washington Monument???" WHY! I don't give a damnwho built it, or anything else that was build, whether it was byChinese people, Latinos, Americans, Indians, Egyptians, just stop withthe slave comments! Moving on: all the action scenes were boring, andmade no sense what so ever. Honestly I hate this film, and won'trecommend to watch it. Waste of time, and money. And for any haters outthere - Let me tell you, THIS MOVIE SUCKED BIG TIME, NO MATTER WHAT YOUSAY!!!!
