"Spider-Man: Homecoming" is a very good movie, mixing a JohnHughes-style teen film and a superhero flick ? which may actually be aproblem for anyone over 25 year old. This movie feels like it wasdeftly taken right off the comic book pages, like no other superherofilm before it, seeing a truly juvenile, but well meaning, teen, whonow has super powers, try to be a hero. However, just as it is unlikely someone over 25 (being generous withthat high of an age) will read a superhero comic, it's unlikely anadult would really enjoy a teen, coming-of-age comedy, like "SixteenCandles", for example.I am well aware of how odd this review may read, highly complimenting"Spider-Man: Homecoming" (it is an excellent movie), but alsosuggesting it may not be as enjoyable for those over 25, than thoseunder that age. This film is simply going to play much better for theyounger crowd.
