I went to see this movie with no expectations and i'm glad i did. Thismovie was okey if you are not a classic spiderman fan or you readultimate spiderman, otherwise is below average.Things that bothered me: 1_The movie tried very hard to make you laugh,like deadpool movie, it's annoying. Give me some action! 2_I was hopingthat trailer scene of the boat, but then Iron Man solved everything.3_If you want to give spidey a great suit, okey give it to him becausewe are not in 1970, but WHERE IS HIS SPIDER SENSE? That's the worstthing of the movie, no spider sense at all! 4_ Indian skinny nerdFlash? Fat Asian friend? 5_Nobody except Green Goblin or Doc Ock knewwho spiderman really was, and it took several issues. But in this moviealmost everybody knows. 6_ They used the same argument from Spiderman1, Green goblin is his best friend's father... The vulture is hiscrush's dad. Come on!There are just too many bad things in this movie, but hey, people justwant to see techy suits and laugh a lot so Go and see it! You mightlike it....
