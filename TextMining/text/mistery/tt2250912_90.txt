The trashiest spiderman movie of all times. I don't understand the highratings. Things are just happening for no reason in this movie andthere are some really boring relationships as well. First of all, there is absolutely no romance in the story of Peter andthe girl. There is just one girl we know nothing of, whom peter keepsblowing whenever they are together and that is the love story.BS.Secondly, the horrible cruise shipwreck scene. The ship is cut in halfwith the powerful weapon, and the two halves are falling apart withpeople in it, and at first our spidey boy holds them together with hiswebs. oh yeah. but then the webs fail and then Ironman's suit comes tohelp and wait for it..... SEALS the ship back intact! I won't acceptthis garbage from Hollywood. Sorry.Peter's friend who has a really irritating persona is the one who getsto know he is spiderman from the beginning and then he irritates thesh!t out of me throughout the movie!TOO much talking that doesn't even make any sense. The girly high pitchsqueaky voice of spideyboy is annoying. There is not a thing right withthis movie. Oh wait... there is! There is a girl in the movie who isnot the main girl but interestingly she is following pete wherever hegoes and guess what... She has the BEST dialogues in the entire movie.This one is a sad sad attempt from Marvel and I am thinking maybe I amdone with liking Marvel's movies. However, I am really looking forwardto Deadpool coz I loved the first one.
