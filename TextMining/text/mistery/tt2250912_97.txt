It doesn't seem all that long ago that I saw Spider-Man with TobeyMaguire. Has it really been 15 years? Those renditions were the bestever when they came out. This might be the start of something evenbetter. This flick was much lighter in tone with just as much actionand a great story.The star of the movie is the script. You can tell they took their timeand got it right.Michael Keaton makes a great villain. The only thing that keeps thisfilm from being one of the best of all time is the inclusion ofHannibal Buress. He is getting a lot of mileage from throwing BillCosby under the bus. The audience was howling in what appeared to begenuine laughter as he delivered his lines with the dexterity of astick of wood. I'm like WTF?! I am so much in awe that I am consideringselling my soul to the devil.
