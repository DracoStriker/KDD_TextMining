Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release,Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be theirbest feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked itout of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe ABug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every releaseof theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015'sextraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be thesecond great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully areturn to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot isthat it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Landof the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual,entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids'movie, and very few "adult" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this iseven more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both ofthose films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this onedid. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike mostemotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began toopenly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experiencedbefore. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to beenormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reacheslevels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and TheIncredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Deadthey have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollickingadventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. Theother thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the bestPixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, evenbetter than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's(2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering thisis the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless wasone of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favoritePixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), FindingNemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), withMonsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), andInside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by theirseemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even theiroriginals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay atbest. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better atdelivering an important message to children than it is being its ownstory. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back tochildhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003)and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and thetears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movieshould me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of myfavorite movies of all time.RATING: 10.0/10.0
