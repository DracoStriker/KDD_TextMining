Pixar's unique and colorful take on the Dia De Los Muertos was trulyremarkable. The story was a match made in Pixar heaven due to its heartwrenching and heartwarming moments. Though this story seemed a bitmorbid at times, you can really tell Pixar catered this movie to adultsas well as kids. The visual effects were probably my favorite in anyPixar film thus far. The amount of detail on screen at any given timewas beyond belief. Also, the character development was extraordinary.Having an extensive look at each character's background not only helpedyou fall in love with the characters, but it was also used as a uniquestorytelling device. The music in this movie was great too as it paidhomage to the traditional mariachi style still practiced in Mexicotoday. The movie even featured some songs with lyrics entirely inSpanish. Overall, I would say this movie captured the Mexican heritageto a T. The characters were memorable, the story and dialogue wereexceptionally written, the visuals were gorgeous and bursting withcolor, and the music was festive and fun.
