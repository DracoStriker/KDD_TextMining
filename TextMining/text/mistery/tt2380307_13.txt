Let me start of by saying that as Mexican born and resident, I foundthis movie very respectful and honest about our culture. So, watch itwithout any guilt! "COCO" tells the history of Miguel, a music- lovingboy trapped on a shoe maker family that happens to hate music forgenerations, this is because his great-great grandmother was left by amusician. After breaking his family rule of "no music" he embarks on anadventure through the world of the dead. This is Disney at its finest,a powerful movie with a powerful message, even though I found it to bemore on the WDAS territory, it is clearly a Pixar trademark. I cannotspeak about the voice acting in general since I watched in Spanish, butfor that matter the cast was very well developed here in Mexico andthey made a wonderful job on that department. Gael Garcia's did samevoice as in the English version at least I can say that he did a verynice job as Hector. The only thing I didn't like about the movie (Andthe reason I subtract 1 star out of the 10 maximum) was the third act,which I found It to be very cliché with a very, very old trope found inlots of movies and even regular TV shows and cartoons (I ain't going tospoil anything), but don't worry, it is compensated with the rest ofthe movie which I found it be very clever and emotional all the waythrough. And of course! As an old Disney-Pixar tradition this movie isone hell of a Tear-Jerker so don't forget to bring your tissues to thetheater. I'm sure you and your family will enjoy this movie so go seeit, you won't regret it.
