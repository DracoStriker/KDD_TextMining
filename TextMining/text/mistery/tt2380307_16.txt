"Coco" its the latest Disney Pixar animated film, I try not to missthat many Pixar movies and even if a few of them have escaped me Istill do whatever I can do to watch them, I love a good Disney movieand "Coco" its no exception.I know that the gimmick this time its that it takes elements from theMexican tradition known as El dia de los muertos (actually, it takeselements from general Mexican culture) but I cant help to feel thatthis is a small story that happens to take place in a huge startlingworld, we follow our characters through a journey that only affectsthem, the rest of the world does not depend on their fate but theyaren't apathetic towards them, its a nice balance between a big storyand a personal one. The plot isn't anything special, the world it establishes isn't specialeither, the characters are likable but they aren't great, except for afew of them like our main lead who carries the whole movie (as itshould be), yet I wish they would have developed the rest of the familya little more or at least in a better way. The movie opens with exposition, as many modern Pixar movies do, Iremember "Moana" doing this too, it doesn't bother me that much, I knowthat there's a lot to explain and to establish, so I just go along withit until it stops giving us information and tries to have actualscenes, when we get to them they are worth it. While I do like movie Iwill say it hits all the story beats a movie like this would, its notoriginal, its quite predictable and melodramatic at points, but itseffective, for whatever flaws it may have, never do they break the moodand they feel somewhat insignificant when compared to the wonders thefilm offers. The themes and subjects it plays with are familiar to me,physical death isn't the worst thing awaiting man and the pursuit of adream will take away part of you. I was predicting where it would go and I was also awaiting for anspecific moment to come, as I knew that it will be executed perfectly,and it was. I had a good time watching this, when its not being goodits about as average as you can get, that goes to show how superiorPixar is to the rest, when they are not being exceptional they on thesame level as their competition.
