I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I had seen Book ofLife which I really liked. After seeing Coco, I thought it had a goodand touching story, but very similar to Book of Life and therefore veryeasy to end up comparing one to the other.In general I liked Book of life better since it had more humor andfound songs and music to be better. Still a good movie worth watching.
