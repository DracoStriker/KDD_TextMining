Honestly, I wasn't amazed or fantacised by 'Coco'. It's nowhere evennear the same level as Toy Story 3, Inside Out, Up and WALL?E. It wenton for too long, some scenes dragged and weren't that entertaining. Thefirst half especially was extremely dull, I literally just didn't knowwhy I was watching the film. But the day of the dead scenes were kindaentertaining and quite a bit of fun. That was really when the filmstarted to pick itself up a bit. The animation is spectacular and I'mglad that Pixar satisfied me with their stunning visuals, like theyalways do. The characters are good-fun and are people you candefinitely relate to. Miguel is a great lead and when he's stuck withthese skeleton-like people (I don't know what to call them, sorry!), itreally is a lot of fun and entertaining. Although I didn't even enjoyCoco that much, I'm pretty sure you will, I'm pretty sure you'd like towatch it.I enjoyed this one less then Cars 3 but give it a watch, andif you don't want to, don't. The first 40-50 minutes you may not beentertained or satisfied like I was, but you will be surprised andamazed and the second half. My overall review of the film is that it'snot bad, watch it if you want to.
