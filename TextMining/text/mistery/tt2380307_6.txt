Taking place in contemporary Mexico, in a fictional village named SantaCecilia, "Coco" tells the story of a 12 year old musician, MiguelRivera, whose family - ironically - hates music. There's a pretty goodreason why they are against music though. Anyway, nothing can killMiguel's dreams to meet the success of his icon, Ernesto de la Cruz. Itall gets more complicated when he discovers that he is his ancestor and"steals" his magic guitar, which sends him to the World of the Dead.Throughout his journey there, he has the company of his adorable dog,Dante, and a trickster skeleton, Hector. That's how much I can revealabout the story.Coco is a flawlessly crafted movie. It's a visual marvel, a musicalphenomenon that has three dimensional characters, top-notch voiceacting, great sense of humor, a wonderful, deep message and some reallyemotional moments that will surely make you cry. Coco is about death,life, love, music and hope. It's also the best and most loyalrepresentation of Mexican culture and the Dia des Muertos (Day of theDead) holiday I've ever seen. At the same time, it's very refreshing,creative and authentic, which will surprise those who think it's acarbon copy of "Book of Life". It now has a special place in my heartand it's yet another masterpiece from the studio that reinvented theanimation genre.
