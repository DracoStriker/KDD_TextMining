A slow-burning character centric drama, that's powerful themes of raceand acceptance are just as resonate today as they were in the time inwhich Dee Ree's impressive film is set, Mudbound is one of the finestfilms yet released through Netflix's streaming service and a potentialplayer at the upcoming awards season that is soon to be upon us.Adapted from Hillary Jordan's sprawling novel of the same name,Mudbound tells the seemingly simple story of two families of differentcircumstance and race, living their lives in the harsh farmingsurrounds of Mississippi during the war torn era of the late 1930's and1940's.Featuring an array of voiceovers and inner voice monologues of both thewhite McAllan family, wannabe farmers who've in many ways gone into aventure that is beyond their capabilities and the black Jackson family,who are hardworking and knowledgeable farm hands determined to make themost of their lot in life, Mudbound offers an insightful andemotionally resonate look at American culture of the time.The McAllan's, led by Jason Clarke's one-eyed Henry and featuring CareyMulligan's kind spirited Laura, Henry's racist father Pappy (playedwonderfully despicable by Breaking Bad's Jonathan Banks) and Henry'swar pilot and PTSD suffering brother Jamie, which acts as Garret'sHedlund's best big screen performance to date, showcase a familystruggling to coming to grips with who and what they are.The opposite then to the Jackson family, led brilliantly by Rob Morganand Mary J. Blige's father/mom duo Hap and Florence who are fightingthrough their trials with both the McAllan's, the land and the absenceof Jason Mitchell as their oldest son Ronsel, who has enlisted in thewar, are a family who know exactly what they are in the eyes of thecountry they live in and are a family who have a clear goal on whatthey want out of their landscape.There's a lot of character's and movements for Ree's to juggle as sheflies between both various timelines, countries and a sprawlingcollection of personal but she handles it all with aplomb.Employing almost a Malick like sensibility of visual palettes,voice-over and construction, Ree's film is big in scheme and scope butis most importantly an intimate character exploration of both thesehuman beings and a country that may've been at war overseas but wasalso at war within itself and this powerful expose is broughtpowerfully to life by the young filmmaker and her on-song cast.Ending up being one of the years strongest ensembles, Mudbound'srecognisable cast are all as good as each other, even though standoutsinclude Hedlund, the increasingly impressive Jason Mitchell and RobMorgan's Jackson family patriarch, while the likely key awards playerBlige showcases a previously untapped ability as an actress that willlikely see the music star feature more prominently in films to come.Each actor displays a care and nuance for the material at play and asthis slowly paced drama proceeds on a path of certain confrontation,bubbling racial tensions and character motivations coming to theforefront, Mudbound's final segments will pack a powerful punch toviewers who've becoming entrenched in the dirt and grain of the filmand will make this an experience that sticks with you after the creditshave rolled.Final Say ? Not a perfect film and one that unquestionably has been told before,Mudbound is still an undeniably effective and brilliantly acted epicthat touches upon some highly volatile and important themes. Anchoredby all-round award worthy turns and a career defining directionaleffort by Rees film is one of the year's top films and easily one ofNetflix's best release's yet.4 ½ mud filled crops out of 5
