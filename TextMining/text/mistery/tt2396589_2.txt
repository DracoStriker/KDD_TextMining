Wasn't going to go to this, but so very glad I did. Netflix has made afilm worthy of the highest praise. If the book is better than thismovie, this is a book for your library. The entire screening audiencebecame engrossed in this movie, so quiet you could hear a pin drop onthe carpet. The story unfolds necessarily slow and snares you. Thenarrations by different characters at different times, helps to pullthe viewer in lightly forcing a personal touch to each story. Thedifferent perspectives of the storytellers is blatantly obvious whilethe movie spares little in realistic actions that make the viewercringe at times, laugh at times and cry at times. it doesn't hold backThe acting is top notch, even though I had only heard of a hand full ofthese players, one not even being an actor. The cinematography is upthere, crisp and a great player in the mood of this movie. It hadeducational moments too, while not being preachy, it just shows andtells where we have been. It is also a movie for our times. People fromthe screening audience are still taking about this move 4 days later.An Oscar contender this should be.
