I admit that I'm extremely tough on Netflix when it comes to film. Theyrelease brilliant television, but their film output is definitelylacking as far as quality, but I'm glad to say that Mudbound is a greatdrama. It was well directed, well shot, and it had a pretty good scoreto go along with it. This movie also has an ensemble cast filled withgreat performances especially from Jason Mitchell. My only problem withthis movie is that it takes a little too long to take off and becomeinteresting, but the movie makes it up by ending on a powerful note.This is definitely the best movie Netflix has released since Beasts ofno Nation.
