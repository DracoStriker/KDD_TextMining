A good and extremely well acted film. It is really the netflix filmthat could make the difference in terms of awards recognition. It isnot your typical racism film as it tells another side of it. It isabout two young men who would never be in any way friends if it wasn'tfor one thing they have in common. Both are war veterans and returnhome with a trauma. One is the son of a farm aid, the other is thebrother of the owner of the farm. But it is not the only story thisensemble piece tells. The acting is the best reason to see the film.Rob Morgan was the MVP for me. It was a performance that worked waybeneath his dialogue. A very deep and moving character and he managedit absolutely realistic. Jason Mitchell was great as well, especiallytowards the end. He has for sure the battiest role. Garrett Hedlundcomes right after with a very controlled and intense turn. He surely isunderrated for his acting, I also liked Mary J. Blige who had somegreat small moments, but after all the buzz I expected something moreintense. Much of her performance works through her expressions whichwere great and real. Carey Mulligan and Jonathan Banks were great aswell. Jason Clarke had his moments but was possibly the weakest of thebunch, but that was mostly because of his pale character, The film wasextremely well shot, nicely directed and had a great screenplay. At thebeginning it dragged a little bit but it is definitely worth to see andthe ending is extremely intense, shocking and memorable. And the finalscene has to be one of the most beautiful scenes of the year.
