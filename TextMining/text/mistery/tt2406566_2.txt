I think many reviewers, including the mainstream media, have been fartoo generous to this film.Basically, the plot line is rather thin so there is a lot of emphasison style. Charlize Theron ponces around in a lot of different designeroutfits - she seems to be wearing a different one for each scene - and,despite knocking back bottles of Stolichnaya vodka and chain smoking,she still seems to be able to beat the crap out of every man who triesto kill her.Percival, the British agent heading up Berlin, is another hard boozing,hard smoking spy who likes to drive at top speed around the city in hisPorsche (wanting to blend into the local environment apparently, plushis short haircut).The film does have some good fight scenes and what makes it credible isthe West and East Berlin backdrop that is very authentic and capturesthe mood of the time, and I also enjoyed the 1980s background music.However, the whole film is a bit of a tongue-in- cheek romp that has avery thin veneer of depth to it.
