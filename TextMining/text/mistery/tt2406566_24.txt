The story is weak and doesn't make sense. There's no special style toit (like, say, John Wick). The protagonist is not charming or sexy(maybe she was ~20 years ago). Laws of physics are ignored but itdoesn't bring anything interesting to the table (like, say, Fast &Furious). It's not funny or fun.It's basically a piece of feminist propaganda. "Men are incompetentand/or crooked, women fix up their mess and are stronger and smarterthan them".Mind you, it's not _terrible_. With all its flaws, its decently done.Sometimes it actually does let Charlize Theron do some sensitive stuffa skilled woman fighter would do against bigger and stronger men (useleverage, weapons...). It has elements of spy movies (everybodybetraying everybody else, secret drop points...). It keeps moving, it'snot boring. Misandry is actually quite minimal for such a premise.But, when Theron, a 40ish woman, gets up a second after being hit hardin the head by a trained man twice her size, it all just comes crashingdown (like she should have). Or where she says that she basically"manipulated everything from the very beginning" to get the mainvillain, which is like 10 years younger than her and for it to workout, it would take more than 10 years to set up, so, he was still inhigh school when she started... you feel like the author(s) of thismovie should go back to (high) school before someone lets them makeanother movie.About the only way you can like this movie is if you like CharlizeTheron kicking ass, or like feminist propaganda movies in general.Otherwise, there's nothing to see here.
