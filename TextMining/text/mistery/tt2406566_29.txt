I would like to start by addressing two criticisms that I keep seeingin reviews often. The first is that it is too much like John Wick witha female lead, and the second is that it is an example of Feminism gonecrazy in 2017. Addressing the latter first, I do not see much in theway of feminist propaganda throughout the movie. I am usually one ofthe first to pick up and point out political agenda in movies, and I amjust not seeing it here. It has a strong female lead with plenty ofstrong male supporting characters. Not so much in the way of "GirlPower" that others seem to notice. People seem to forget that therewhere a lot of female spies during WWII, and I find it kind of nice tosee this one picking that up as a story. As for the former (being aripoff of John Wick); Sure, I guess you could say that it takes sometips from that movie, but with a radically different style. I only seea slight connection.This movie plays off of the WWII spy theme that is often over used bymovies these days, but with a refreshing take. It is also filmed in astyle reminiscent of movies like Sin City, and Watchmen (both movies Iwould recommend). It can be a bit slow at times, but it will keep youentertained throughout and ends pretty nicely. Still the story doesleave a bit to be desired, and the writing is pretty much the normalfor a lot of movies these days. Not fantastic, but not terrible. Thelighting could use some work, but they where trying to set a tone forthe movie and accomplished it marginally well. Special shout-out to thecamera work during the fight scenes, which are themselves fantastic.Overall, I would defiantly recommend renting this one if you cannotfind anything else to watch. Don't get your hopes up, but don't expectto be too disappointed either. 7 out of 10 from me.
