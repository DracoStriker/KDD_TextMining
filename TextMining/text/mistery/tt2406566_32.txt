What is Charlize Theron doing in this? Having said that, what was shedoing in Mad Max? The movie looks like it was made by a young male whojust discovered 80's music and spy films and decided to combine the twointo a movie. The fight scenes suggest the whole thing is tongue incheek but if that is case the character direction/acting undoes it all.Why does Charlize Theron whisper all the time? And why do charactersspeak facing away from the other spy. That hasn't been done since thePink Panther and that was a spoof. Each scene is started with an 80's'classic' which has one thinking that a record company is behind thewhole thing. On the whole, an empty experience but the fight scene onthe stairs is mega. Even though I'm only giving it 5 stars I'd nearlysit through the whole thing again just for that.
