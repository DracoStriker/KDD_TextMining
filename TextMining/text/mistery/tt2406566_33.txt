Another movie that shows Russians as the bad guys. Am I the only onewho is sick of them? Even so, this movie is awful on many other levels,starting with the non-existence of a decent plot. I haven't read thebook (or the cartoon?) but this movie definitely did not made sense. Ihave waited for a twist for the entire length of the movie. SPOILER: itcame, but did not make much sense. Who is this woman? Who does she workfor? Why was Percival the way he was? Maybe he got so accustomed toBerlin's duality, he developed a duality on his own. Who knows? And,also, who cares? This movie was a total waste of time. I watchedbecause Charlize and James McAvoy are terrific actors; well, usually.In this movie, Theron overacted her part, and she seemed extremelyfake. But, let me be fair, I did manage to stick to the end. So thatmust count as something. And also, if you want to see Charlize Theronin a lot of different designer clothes I could recommend the movie,though I'm still perplexed as to how she managed to bring all thoseclothes, which included multiple shoes, boots, and coats, in two tinybags into Germany. Ps. what was the deal with the Queen song 'Under Cover' in the lastscene? Not that I am not a fan of the song but it totally did not fitthe mood of the scene. Never a good sign when someone barely controlslaughter in a serious scene.
