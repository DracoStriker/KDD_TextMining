Lessons learned from this movie...1. Smoking makes you really look cool and a great example to follow. 2.Beating up a dude and smoking his cigarette butt makes you even cooler.3. Drinking an alcoholic beverage before popping a dude in the headwith a handgun really really really makes you pretty cool. 4.Apparently a skinny fragile woman can disable a bunch of male thugsfive times her size and strength without even flinching.Wow !.....whatever happened to the days of good movies ?.....Another one hour and fifty five minutes of my life I'll never be ableto redeem again and fill with doing something useful. The only positivething I could extract from this terrible experience was that CharlizeTheron does quite a convincing British accent.Avoid this like the plague !....
