Atomic Blonde does not offer anything particularly original when itcomes to the plot, it is your typical spy story. The film looks goodthough, the action scenes are very well filmed, fast paced andentertaining and the photography was nicely done too. Kudos to CharlizeTheron for her performance, I think she really nailed this one. Thestory itself is not moving as fast as all the fights but it is enoughto keep you hooked. Another positive thing in my opinion is thesoundtrack. If you like 80's music, you are definitely going to enjoythis film. All in all it is a decent film and I do not think you aregoing too make a mistake if you decide to spend 2 hours of your time onit.
