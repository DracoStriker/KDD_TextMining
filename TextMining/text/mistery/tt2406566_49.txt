A Cold War spy flick directed by stuntman-turned-filmmaker DavidLeitch, after cutting his teeth with JOHN WICK (2014), as both theproducer and uncredited co-director, now he is currently the helmer ofDEADPOOL 2. In the tumult of Berlin Wall's impending collapse, thisretro-futuristic action-er pits MI6 spy Lorraine Broughton (Theron)against a bunch of ruthless Soviet Union KGBs and a friend-or-foe localcontact David Percival (McAvoy), to seek out a leaked list which willput all the field agents in the Soviet Union in danger and also, findout who is the mole with the appellation "Satchel". Before anything else, ATOMIC BLONDE is a Theron's star-vehicle, thepoint-blank, minutely choreographed fisticuffs between her and herco-stars/stunt-performers are brutal, visceral and bluntlyfemale-empowering, they are divested of the usual veneer of sleeknessand flaunting, but revert to a primal, beastly, clumsy combat exigencywhich could take place between non-martial artists, but lethal killersbattling with instinct. The film adds another brickbat to her throne asHollywood's most redoubtable ass-kicker, and that title is notinclusively confined to the distaff circle.Berlin, brisk, forbidding and sunless under the daylight, breaths aniridescent decadence and nihilism into its nocturnal life where thisconvoluted triple-agent shaggy-dog tale takes its shoddy shape throughLorraine's stiltedly obfuscating recounting in the MI6 headquarter,sadly, the screenplay fails to live up to the standard of an arrestingthriller, there are over-stretched longueurs moseying between fightingsequences which barely subsist to engage audience's attention(including Lorraine's soft-headed lesbian relationship with a Frenchtenderfoot), thus the tantalizing of its plot wears thin quickly,however, a cracking miscellany of Synth-Pop/Electronic hits becomes theunexpected grace note to render the restive zeitgeist. Last but not least, James McAvoy emits some coruscating élan when he isnot typecast as the salt-of-the-earth sort, his morally ambiguousPercival is an effervescent foil against Theron's prosaicinscrutability, maybe Hollywood has been using him all wrong, insteadof relentlessly priming him as a matinée idol, he is much more in hiswheelhouse as a chameleon-like character player, a rogue withdistinctive charm.
