I thoroughly enjoyed this escapade with hard-working Charlize Theron!Some viewers compared her to James Bond in female form, but it goesmuch further than that, hence my summary title. Perhaps the producerschose the film's name as 'Atomic Blonde' for this very reason.A movie with lots of kick-ass action, in a serious but light-heartedand most entertaining spy thriller, made great viewing and the almost 2hours duration was well spent. But then again you can't pleaseeveryone!The majority of viewers rate this movie slightly lower than my ratingof 8, whereas my ratings are usually below what the majority thinks! Ihave no regrets watching this movie I would have skipped because of thetitle, as a silly, dumb blonde comedy which, on all counts, itcertainly is not!
