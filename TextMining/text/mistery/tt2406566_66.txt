It can't decide if it should be drama, thriller or action. First ofthere's no character development,it just sort of jump right into itwith both feet.Which again doesn't really help the movie.Cause you aregiving no reason to sympathize with any of the characters.It get toldmostly in flashback,So it switches a lot between a debriefing in thepresent,and the past where all the action take place.Some of the shooting and stunts are great in terms of effects,butnothing more.The biggest problem it has, is story development and pace. The pace isway to slow to keep you interested,or for you to invest in any of thedifferent agents. And it's full of illogical plot holes the size ofgrand canyon.Especially when Charlize's character is suppose to besuper pro.Agent. They all act like amateurs,instead of the pro's theysuppose to be.But they seem to have done a great job of recreating Berlin,as it wasduring the cold war.Maybe that's where all the effort went,cause itsure didn't go into the storyline or the script.A good portion of the bad guys,survive way to much.Even for Hollywoodbad guys. It get to the point were it's simply too much for a seriousmovie,and not a comedy
