What's with the soundtrack? Does it need 50 pop songs and other"noise"? This has become a trend with all movies, the background soundhas become the the main soundtrack and dialogue is lost! Apart from thefact characters no longer speak a line, they mumble it, whisper it andunless we have subtitles we miss a big part and have to guess what wassaid!As for the movie, not sure there was an actual story, a lot of actionby Charlize is about it, plus unnecessary sex scene by herself and someother bit part actress. Not appealing to men, at least not to me butseems women like that sort of stuff. A lot of blood "splatter ontocamera lens", as if the camera man was actually in the scene/room orplace! She is bruised and battered during the interview by hersuperiors, 3 days later doesn't have a mark on her! Get real! If youask me, it was a stupid movie. I watched it because I like Charlize,but I think this was not a good idea on her part, should be morechoosy.
