Who still thinks smoking cigarettes looks cool? Now it just looksweird. Hollywood sure still does and smoking in movies/TV is asprevalent now as it ever was (or even more so). The cigarette companiescan't make TV commercials anymore but they don't need to when they haveHollywood to do it for them. Anyone who doesn't think the tobaccogiants are paying big bucks to Hollywood is nuts. Dunno when Hollywoodis going to get in sync with what's really going on around it. Now onto this movie if I can see through all the cigarette smoke. Charlizereally missed the mark on trying too hard to be cool in this flick. Ifthis is what feminism is, I'll walk to the other side of the streetwhen one walks by. She just comes across as typical of Hollywoodarrogant and not at all likable. I like her in some movies but not inthis one. Her beating up McAvoy and sitting on him while he is talkingwith a cigarette hanging out his mouth for a minute or two, and thentaking the cig out of his mouth to take a cool hit just about sums upthis movie. Whatever message Hollywood and Charlize were trying toproject in this movie was sure lost on me. Movie was just boring to mein spite of the not believable fight scenes by a skinny blonde chick."Yeah right" was all I could come up each time she kicked someone'sbutt. Just glad I don't see as many disgusting cigarettes smokers as Iused to. Lots in Hollywood though.
