I love spy movies, this is not one of them. Talk about superficial.The plot was impossible to follow. There was almost no dialog. I wentto see it because of the trailer about her training for the fightscenes, which was more engaging and had more information and plotdevelopment then this entire movie.If it wasn't for the fact I was drinking heavily and was enjoying thesound track I would have walked out. I seriously thought about catchingthe end of Wonder Woman in the theater next door, now I'm wishing Ihad.
