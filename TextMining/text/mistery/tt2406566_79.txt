Not the best of Theron I've come to love and expect. In fact, I wasvery disappointed to see so much violence and especially toward awoman. Theron's character seems void of real emotion. The plot is flatand chaotic at times. I lost my way amidst all the crazy gunslinging,hitting, bashing, and banging up stuff. Just got way too much andbecame torturous to watch. I actually held my popcorn in front of myface at one point feeling I was in some kind of sleazy, triple XXXtheater. I hated seeing this beautiful woman beaten up and looking sobad. So beneath her. She's a goddess who deserves better scripts andfar better treatment. Women don't have to play badass chicks to provethemselves anymore. That's getting old.
