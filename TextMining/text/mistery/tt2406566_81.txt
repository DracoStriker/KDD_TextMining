After sitting through 1/2 hour of inane, violent and CGi-heavy previewsof coming movies - including at least one from Spielberg - in my local"Regal" theater, I was not expecting much from Atomic Blonde. Andthat's what I got - nothing but cartoon-ish, over-the-top violence andridiculous acting. Charlize Theron's role was absolutely silly, but Iwas hoping that James McAvoy, Toby Jones, and Eddie Marsan would makeit worthwhile. They didn't. I was even willing to tolerate JohnGoodman's being in the film, but it was all to no avail. A movie for14-year old boys. Maybe that was it's target audience.
