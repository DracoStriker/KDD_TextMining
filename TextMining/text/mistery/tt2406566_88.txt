I was counting down the days 'til this movie finally came out. I evenposted a Snapchat with the Atomic Blonde filter on my FB page-- which,I deleted after watching the movie.As a female, I'm not sure why we had to see Theron's nips so manytimes. And, some of the scenes (nude and sex) were truly unnecessary.I did like the fashion, and Theron always looks beautiful even whenshe's got a black eye. But, the plot was thin. Too thin. Too much nip and butt, not enoughplot. I would have walked out, but I thought I'd give it a fair chance. Iliked the soundtrack. So: two stars for the fashion and soundtrack. That's about it. The movie was too exploitative.
