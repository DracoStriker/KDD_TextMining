I saw "Wonder", starring Owen Wilson-the Zoolander movies, the Night atthe Museum movies; Julia Roberts-Mother's Day, Eat Pray Love; JacobTremblay-Before I Wake, Room and Izabela Vidovic-The Fosters_tv, AboutA Boy_tv. This is a family movie with a message of tolerance andacceptance for those that may look different from themselves. It'sbased on a book by R J Palacio about a boy that was born with TreacherCollins Syndrome, a facial disorder. Owen and Julia are the parents ofJacob and Izabela. Jacob has TCS and has had multiple surgeries for itbut also understands how people can react to seeing his face for thefirst time. Because of this, he has been home schooled by Julia. Now,Julia and Owen decide that it is time that Jacob started going toregular school-5th grade middle school-and try to lead a more normallife with other kids, at least as normal as he possibly can. There aredifferent reactions from the kids; some curious and some veer moretowards bullying. Some, in ignorance, even think Jacob is contagiousand that they will catch TCS if they so much as touch him. There arekids that do become friends with Jacob, despite their peer pressure andtheir single-minded parents. Izabela, who loves her brother very much,also has to deal with feeling neglected, since her parents spend somuch time on Jacob. The movie has a message of tolerance, understandingand even acceptance of people that look different. It's rated "PG" forlanguage and some bullying and has a running time of 1 hour & 53minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-maybe for thegrand-kids-but I did enjoy this heart-warming family movie and it wouldbe a good rental.
