"Wonder" is definitely one of the best movies of this year. It is abouta boy named August / Auggie, who has facial differences ; he has gonethrough 27 surgeries since birth. The movie focuses mainly on the timewhen Auggie is sent to a regular school by his Mom, against Auggie'sDad's wishes. Auggie faces all types of obstacles / problems that anindividual experiences among a group of similar-looking people ; beingstared / frowned at , being accepted with doubts and suspicions , beingbullied. However, Auggie is a tough-minded and intelligent person, andfinally manages to gain genuine acceptance by most of his schoolmatesand other people in the community.Jacob Tremblay plays Auggie ; he has really given a very fine, artisticand genuine performance as a boy with facial differences / deformities.Owen Wilson has given a decent performance as Auggie's daddy ; however,he has been denied a fair deal because Owen's role is very limited inthe movie. Julia Roberts sparkles in the role of Auggie's Mom. Izabellaplays the role of Auggie's sister, and she also excels in her role.The director, Mr Chbosky , has done an inspirational work in thismovie. He has captured the sweetness and healing effects of feel-goodfilms like this lovable "Wonder". Mr Chbosky uses a round-robin chapterstyle of story-telling ; some segments of the movie are named aftercertain characters. He has also managed to squeeze out goodperformances from all actors in the movie. I would love to become astory-writer for movies, because I have also got some interesting andinspirational stories in my mind.
