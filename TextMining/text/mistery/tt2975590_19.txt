Just as with every previous film, Snyder's grandiose visuals supersedeand essentially suffocate any opportunities for intriguing plot,character development, or anything beyond CGI extravagance. The filmpresented too much and not enough simultaneously. The visual effects,dream sequences, and other traditional tropes of an action drama stoodin the way of getting to know or care much about what is going on inthis "universe."PROS - Ben Affleck was a decent Bruce Wayne / Batman. - Henry Cavillremains a solid choice for Superman. - Aqua Man was barely shown. -Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburn, and Jeremy Irons were all solid in theirminor roles. - If you're into special effects, you'll probably enjoythe absurd amount showcased in this film. CONS - Jesse Eisenberg - Snyder apparently forgot that Batman does NOTkill people - The "battle" between Batman and Superman lastedapproximately five minutes of the 151 minute run time. - Batman'sorigin story is repeated and used to accent a major point within thefilm. - Far too much focus on Lois Lane (three heroes and she stillshows up and plays a role in nearly every major battle sequence) - Lackof story and character development - Various plot holes - Ad naseum...This is likely the last superhero film I will waste my time viewing, asthe superhero "team" concept is already abysmal. Showcasing numerousheroes / super humans in one film takes away from the development, andtherefore, the connection to the hero. "Oh well" says Hollywood; we'restill making a killing!
