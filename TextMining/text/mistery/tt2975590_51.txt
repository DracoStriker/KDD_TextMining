Where do I start with this review? Well first of all, within an hour ofwatching the film I completely got lost with where the storyline wasgoing, I had no idea at all what was driving the film, was it a revengefilm?, was it a world vs superman story?. Where did Wonderwoman and theother characters fit into it? By at least an hour and a half into themovie I fell asleep in the cinema. Then as the film picked up and aloud explosion woke me, I saw a creature on the screen that I instantlyrecognised as Doomsday, shock, gasp, horror, they have used a creaturethat has already been done in the superman universe. I was sodisappointed with this film, I left the pictures thinking I was nevergoing to get back those two and a half hours and I'm never going towatch a Ben Affleck movie ever again. The acting was poor, thebat-mobile didn't even look like the bat-mobile, and all the costumeswere not what you would think they should look like, all in all i wasnot happy with this movie at all. For die hard fans of the comics andthe other films before this, I would avoid it at all costs. So unhappywith how this film panned out after all the hype surrounding it.
