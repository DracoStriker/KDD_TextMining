Ever since this movie was announced, I have been looking forward to seethis. Batman vs Superman has the potential to be the biggest actionmovie ever. It has all the necessary background material from the maincharacters that only a very incompetent team of filmmakers can makethis movie to be a disaster. Sadly, this is exactly what Snyder and histeam proves himself to be in this movie.The title of the movie itself is misleading. It should have been calledBatman vs a weak superman. Superman is shown so weak throughout themovie, without any apparent reason, that you feel pity for him. Hissupernatural powers seem to work selectively throughout the movie.**SPOILERS** Superman can hear when his GFs in trouble but he can'twhen his mother is kidnapped? He can hear when Batman is planning tosteal the data from Lex, but he has no idea kryptonite will be stolento use it against him? **SPOILER ends** Really disappointed that thismovie didn't care to show us the tensions between Superman an Batmanbut was pushing all along to make them friends. And that lame situationused to suddenly make Batman forget his hatred towards Superman, Lol. The movie is so poorly written, directed and edited that its not evenfunny. The title of the movie is in itself misleading as there are veryfew scenes in the movie where you can feel two superheroes going ateach other. I am really disappointed that the movie about my two bestsuperheroes is made by Snyder and team who seems to lack competency tomake such huge movie.
