I am utterly astonished. Watched the U.S. premiere of this movie; it'sabsolutely one of the best comic movies ever made. Whatever Zack smokedwhile making this epic masterpiece, I want some.All the actors exceed your expectations. Laughed at the absurdity ofJesse Eisenberg playing Luthor? Laughed at the pathetic Ben Affleckplaying the Caped Crusader? All of you fanboys are so horribly wrong.Eisenberg is at his best. He's the most sinister and brilliant Lexwe've ever seen. More a conniving weasel than a real estate mogul.Affleck gives one of his most thought-provoking roles. This movie isart. It deserves Oscars. Also kudos to Zimmer. His score is bothhaunting and epic at the same time.The direction is absolutely fantastic. Zack masterfully blends shots ina poetic way. The pacing is absolutely better than other comic bookmovies; we see things build up to this great, epic, brawl instead ofgetting bits and spurts. It makes the overall payoff much, much better.This movie feels like a Greek epic come to the big screen. Terrio'swriting style and Ben Affleck's assistance come shining through thescreenplay, which will silence the Man of Steel haters. The flow of thenarrative is smooth. There is humor, there is wit. There is mythos,there is sadness. There is even a lot of subtle political commentarythat Terrio sneaks in. You will feel many, many emotions while watchingthis. I also have to mention that the third act is easily the apex ofcomic-book-dom. It feels like a hodge podge of some of the greatestmoments in comics brushed onto the canvas of this movie. Zack's done it guys. He's made a darn masterpiece. We should thank thisman. He's created this year's Mad Max. A blockbuster movie that exceedseven the strongest naysayer's expectations. It's everything we wantedin a comic book movie but more.P.S. Marvel's movies don't hold a candle to this one. D.C. has theirEmpire Strikes Back.
