100 minutes into this movie and you are still waiting!! waiting for thebatman legacy created so craftily by bruce wayne to appear in some formor shape!! Ben looks more depressed than serious!!! he fails to carrythe class, the swag, the inherent attitude and glam of a Wayne!! helooks tired and old!! Superman on contrary is the only saving grace!!! Hopeless plot, idiotic acting by Ben and the girl, stupid misplacedemotional outbursts and what all is not wrong here!!This is a shame to the legacy of batman movies!! lex luthor goes on todo overacting, not knowing the fine line between appearing psychoticand actually behaving like one!!! Totally depressed by this flick!! don't go!! you will come out cursingand feeling bad for batman!! He deserved much better!!
