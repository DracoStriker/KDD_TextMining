Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman was pure awesome and dark. You can seehe's traumatized by the events in the past, and he has some fantasticlines in general (Yes we see the whole parents thing again). Nobodyshould really be surprised that he was good with the role consideringhe's a solid actor, but I thought he was great. Versus Bale? That's ainteresting question, because Affleck definitely regards Batman as apermanent part of his persona, while in Nolan series he eventuallydoesn't want Batman. In combat he's pretty much everything everyonewould hope for from a film with Batman. One comment on the latest BvStrailer said he fought like the Arkham video games from a scene theyshowed. That's a good comparison. He's incredible in fights. Also theway Snyder records him in action, you can actually see him fightingunlike the Nolan films, which I'd imagine would make many people happy.He also gets a chance to use his detective skills, do not worry. Alsohis relationship with Irons, who plays Alfred, is just wonderful ingeneral. Irons was exceptional in the role (Its Jeremy Irons forChrist's sake, of course he nailed the role) gets some witty lines andalso gets pretty emotional later on. He didn't get a lot of screentime, just enough to be effective. Always passing advice to Batman.
