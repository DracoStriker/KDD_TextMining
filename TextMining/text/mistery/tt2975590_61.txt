This movie was supposed to be a amazing experience for the comic bookreaders and the film enthusiasts. Instead it created more division thanunity. And I'm not talking about the Batfans going againstSuperman-fans. This movie has so many mixed opinions. It's okay if youhate it or loved it. But I'm stuck in the middle. It brought us one ofthe best Batman after Christian Bale's performance. And also some fightscenes and CGI that was killer. But the motives were very unclear. TheMother Issue was a complete turn off and a let down. The build-up isabsolutely pointless as the battle ends with them becoming friends bythe mentioning of a name that can literally be mentioned at any givenmoment. If Batman was Batman he could easily listened to what Supermanhad to say about his mother. And Superman could have easily swooped himfrom the sky and taken him down. Point is this movie should have beencalled Fans vs Rotten Tomatoes: Dawn of Disappointment.
