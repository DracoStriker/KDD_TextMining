I am totally convinced any review of this movie above five stars isfake. I did not think it's humanly possible to make a BORINGSuperman/Batman movie - but somehow it happened. All I can think of atthis point is that Snyder purposely tried to ruin it, there's no otherexplanation. It's that bad.After mucking through two hours of terrible, slow development thatnever happens, you actually see the boys fight. And after about twominutes you begin to think "why are they fighting in the first place?"I still haven't figured out why Lex is even in this movie - he hasabsolutely no real reason to be angry at Superman or Batman. And by theway, Eisenberg totally ruins the character - over acts through theroof, no charisma, most of his scenes you think what the world is hetalking about? There's going to have to be some real damage control forthe Luthor role in any future movie.Unbelievably disappointed. Still in a fog about how this movie couldhave so much fluff in the middle. I never thought in a million yearsI'd be dozing off during a Batman flick, but alas, I did. Any rebootfor Superman OR Batman will need some very serious changes, veryserious.
