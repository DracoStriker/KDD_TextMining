If you are just looking for a digital special effects show, buy aticket and enjoy your popcorn and coke! there are a few novel digitaleffects there but do not ask for a rational story. Batman ismanipulated against superman by a mad scientist in seconds and suddenlybecomes Superman companion in less than seconds! The mad scientist (theworst artist for this role) makes a fight which it simply does not makesense. Why he does this? what does he want? NO answer! weak links andirrational reasons. It seems that Nolan got surprised by a new idea andmade up the story over a night with no editing! Batman is used to beknown as a fair and rational person. Why he suddenly decide to act as acriminal and fight back the BAD guys by marking them?? Why he does notuse his super artificial intelligent system to check the SCIENTISTbackground? why superman can hear his girlfriend scream from the Arcticbut he can not hear his mum????? Whole the movie reminds you a teenagecomic. Actually, not a 2016-teenager, but a 1916-one! As even my10-year-old son did not buy it and rate it awful!
