Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was a movie I wanted to love. Beinga huge enthusiast of films and comics, the thought of seeing Batman andSuperman together in one film seemed too good to be true.Unfortunately, the previews leading up to this film had made medoubtful. To be on the safe side, I brought myself to lower myexpectations to the extent that even if the movie was lacking in someareas, I could still find enjoyment out of it. Every part of me wantedto like this movie, but BvS managed to take everything with it, sparingno survivors. This film was ruled by money, and its pure purpose wasprofit. All the dignity of making a respectable film had been strippedaway before it began. Zero plot development, rushed scenes, terribledialogue, fight scenes that were so bloated with special effects youhardly knew what was happening, character's that were displayed in suchpoor fashion it was laughable( I'm talking to you Lex), the list goeson and on. Their attempt to create a DC universe in one film was adisaster of epic proportions. I ask that you save your money and avoidcontributing to the garbage they tried to pass off as a movie.Somewhere out there, with grinning smiles on their faces, Marvelexecutives are sitting around a table clinging glasses together attheir triumphant victory as top dog from now until the end of time. Ifthis movie is any indication of future films in the DC Universe, beprepared for years of utter disappointment.
