I have to admit, before going into the theater for this pre screening,I knew it would be good, I didn't know it would be amazing. Batman VSuperman is a fresh of breath air in the live action comic book genre.I remember all the hatrid before this movie came out and all the nitpicking, well, all of that got washed away with this masterpiece. Letme first point out Ben Affleck's performance as Batman/ Bruce WayneSurpases all the previous before him. Cavil is Superman, kills it asClark Kent, very true interpretation to the comics. Jesse Eisenberg, nowords can explain how deep this character is and how wonderful of a jobEisenberg does as Luthor. Wonder Woman is fearsome. The action is epic,the story is rich and I can happily say I will be seeing this again andagain, hopefully I did not spoil anything as I want to everyone to haveas good as a time as I did.
