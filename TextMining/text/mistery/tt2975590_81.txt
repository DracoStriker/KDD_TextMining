I think that the movie was really good it mixed it in with there originstories and then had the fighting scene at the end I think it was agood movie. There was a little bit to much talking but it gaveinformation about the characters. All in all the movie was good and thecharacters were excellent and that it is the only movie with batman,superman and wonder woman in it at the same time. look at the brightside this movie leads up to the first ever justice league movie withall different characters it will be the best DC movie ever. well thatis what I think some people will disagree and others wont. But i thinkit was a really good movie and I loved wonder woman.
