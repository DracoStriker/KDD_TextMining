This movie had all the hallmarks of being a long endurance classic butturned an iconic villain into a joker Zuckerburg. The best parts of themovie were in the trailer & the mishmash of editing left you feelinglike there was no continuity to the movie & I really don't care aboutseeing a Justice League made up of these characters. I really enjoyedMan of Steel & the Dark Knight series but this movie sucked. I can'tblame it on Afflack because he wasn't what brought this movie down. Itwas the story & editing that did that. I wouldn't waste my money forthis movie on DVD let alone flop down the cash to see it in 3D. I hopefor more from Suicide Squad because the previews look just as good orbetter than BvS & I know it can't get worse than BvS. If you want BvSget the Frank Miller Dark Knight story that was butchered in this film.
