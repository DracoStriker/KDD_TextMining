I can summarize the movie as a script trying to base clashes on properpsychologic reasons, but failing to do so, as a result confusing andboring the audience. The scriptwriters tried to put something fromeverywhere to strengthen their thesis, but this caused disintegration.I didn't find the movie gripping, there were jumps from scene to scene.I kept asking myself the questions: "What is going on now?" "Why did hedo that?" And I couldn't find the answers within the movie. I had toread reviews after it.If you haven't seen previous Superman Episodes and have not reviewedcartoons a bit, you may find it difficult to interpret and integratethe seemingly unconnected scenes.The atmosphere was dark as in Batman movies. Nevertheless I wasexpecting vivid colours though black themes usage, but the colours werefaded (in 3D).In addition the movie is named Batman vs Superman, but the reasonsbehind their clash were weak. And after a lot psychology, the movieturned into a stereotype superhero movie, losing its special positionas "Batman vs Superman".Briefly, trying to combine stereotype with psychology unsuccessfullyruined the high cost movie. It could have been better processed andfast-moving. I got bored watching it which lasted more than 3 hourswith the ads and the break. I don't recommend.
