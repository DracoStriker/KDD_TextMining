I was pleased when I heard Ben Affleck was going to be the new Batmanand in this film I think he does a good job. I can't think of an actorworking today who looks more like how I imagine Batman. Unfortunatelyhe's stuck in this horrible mess of a movie.Good points - As well as Affleck who does wonders with no decentdialogue, Wonder Woman is also very good but she's not in it much. Infact if you've seen the trailer you've seen the best bits of her. Andthat's it really. I can't think of anything else that's good about thisfilm.Bad points - Jessie Eisenberg is terrible as Lex Luthor. Seems like hethought he was playing the part of the Joker. He's all nervous ticksand zany humour (none of which is funny). Lois Lane has nothing of anyinterest to do other than be saved by Superman once every half hour.And as for Superman, well he's just miserable which doesn't help whenhe's played by an actor who has no range. He doesn't come across as agood guy at all. Where I could accept Batman being angry and vengefulall the time, Superman is supposed to be more of a clean cut guy withmorals. Cavill's Superman cares not a jot if hundreds of innocentpeople die as long as Lois is okay. Then there's the script. It makesno sense. There are so many occasions when characters do things withoutreason or motive. Such as why Lex Luthor creates Doomsday. There is noexplanation about why he would do this, or what he will gain from it.And finally there's the three dream sequences that seem to have beeninserted into the movie just because they look awesome. They might aswell have stuck in the opening scene of the Star Destroyer in Star Warsjust because it looks good, then cut to Ben Affleck waking up in a coldsweat because he's had another irrelevant dream.If Zack Snyder continues to direct these movies I'll be checking out.Let's hope Suicide Squad helps to erase the memory of this appallingexcuse for a movie.
