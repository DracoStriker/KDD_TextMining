Is not the best movie I ever see,, not even the best superhero movie,that's for sure, but I love every single minute of it and I think thatthe people is hating it 'cause some critics say so.I understand that is not a movie for everyone, because is long, denseand have a lot of easter eggs for fans, but if you enjoy DC comics,have a little knowledge of the characters and you like Zack Snyder, Ithink, at least, you can enjoy it. I enjoy every single character, even the ones that I think I was gonnahate, and the writing seems logical and coherent.But let me tell you my real opinion, if you think that this movie isworst than The Dark Knight Rises or Superman Returns, I think we'veseen two completely different movies.
