Ben Affleck did an excellent performance playing Batman. AlthoughChristian Bale wasn't good enough but Affleck is even better. I'vewatched it in the theater and I watched it on DVD. It blew my mindaway. All the fighting scenes between Batman and Superman was intense.The Man of Steel versus the Dark Knight. It's nothing like I've seenbefore. The first two Batman films by Tim Burton is still close to myheart but this one is superb and dark. I can't wait for Justice League.
