As a die-hard Saw fan I was really hyped for the eighth installment. Ihad high expectations. Once I watched the movie, I realized: Do I likeit? When the movie was half way through I did not understand mostparts, but later I found out how the plot worked and stuff. The plottwist at the end is cool (not the best) and I did not see it coming. Iwas kind of disappointed though when I went home. Once in bed I startedpuzzling all pieces together end I found out the plot was actuallypretty good! I liked the movie and it was fun to watch. It is not thebest Saw movie, but A lot better than Saw 7 (Saw the final chapter). Ifyou are a big Saw fan just like me, go watch it! You will probably likeit :D
