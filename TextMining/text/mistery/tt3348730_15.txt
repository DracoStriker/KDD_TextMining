So it has been a long time since a Saw film came out but this wascertainly worth the wait. Jigsaw is not very scary but it isn't tryingto be. It is a smart and fun entry that modernizes the Saw franchise.It was REALLY cool to see Tobin Bell on the big screen again, like thatguy is so freakin cool! The characters range from cool to not cool, butthe worst character is the one who survives! It's the person you wantedto see die the most, yet he walks out A-OKAY. These Saw movies have aknack for doing that! The gore in this movie is INCREDIBLE and featuresdownright the BEST gore moment of the entire Saw franchise, where aguy's head is split down the middle like an apple slicer. It had mecheering, because it is not only the best gore moment in the entire Sawfranchise but one of the best gory moments I've ever seen in theaters!The twist at the end sent chills down my spine, like wow I neverwould've guessed it and it made so much sense too. I was so happy thisfilm was good. I would probably rank it in fourth place behind Saw 1,2, and 3, and it ties with Saw 6. I would recommend you buy a tickettonight!
