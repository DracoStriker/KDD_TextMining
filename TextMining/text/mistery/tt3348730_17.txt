REVIEW - JIGSAW Who remembers the very first Saw film and how through the course of themany films the whole premise seemed to get lost to the investigation.The premise that it was a game with an outcome you could choose. In many ways this latest installment returns to the original premisebut......Generally a good (not great) film but certainly worth your time. One or two plot holes which of course I will not give away. My biggest problem with the film is why? As with Ghost In The Machine,why tell us the complete story in one film, why not leave us wantingmore? The above doesn't generally spoil the film which does have a lot oftwists and turns. Rating 8 out of 10
