Jigsaw doesn't have over the top traps, where you chop off your arm(Saw VI). OR impossible traps where you put your hand in a jar of acidto retrieve a key just to get your chest ripped open (Saw III). Historyrepeats itself and Jigsaw goes back to their old roots being simple,with basic traps and a mind blowing ending. Unfortunately there's onetrap I disliked, it involves lasers. It relies on CGI too much, thestakes are high but the practical traps are way more fun and creative.With wires, tricks, chains, a puppet and the classic pig head, thisfilm will leave you a with a smile on your face.
