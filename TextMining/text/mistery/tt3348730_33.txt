I am in a unique position because I would not have chosen to go and seethis movie. I was invited to it for a friends birthday, I can give youmy honest opinion with no prior experience\expectations with thefranchise.Not once did I feel I was missing out having not knowing the series, Asa stand alone movie it did well misdirecting suspicion in some parts.However in a lot of movie I found myself telegraphing what was going tohappen and knowing what was there for a second viewing which I like tobe in the dark for until the second time round. I can forgive thiscause there won't be a next time. The people I was with all said thesame thing... "The first was the best, and the movies went downhilluntil this one." The acting was good the effects were better. However, the twist at the end was a masterpiece I will give it that. Noone could have seen that coming.
