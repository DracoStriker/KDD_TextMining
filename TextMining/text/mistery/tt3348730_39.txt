Just watched jigsaw, and at first it was just okay. But after the filmended, I sat and thought about what I had just watched. I came to theidea that the movie was great if you look at it as a PREQUEL!!! In mymind that's what this was, and for me made it very more enjoyable. Ithas everything you want in a saw movie, Blood, gore, plot twists. Andof course the ah-ah moment that saw is known for.
