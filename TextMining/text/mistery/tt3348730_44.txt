I think its one of the mystifying elements of modern life is that whenI used to want to view people engaging in mutually consensual sex onfilm I had to go to the farthest corner of the DVD store, behind acurtain well away from prying eyes . It was private, creepy and clearlywell hidden away from all decent folk.On the other hand if I wanted to watch people chainsaw the heads offother people , gouge their eyes out ,torture themselves and basicallyportray acts that would have you sentenced for life , they were alwaysdisplayed in a prominent position next to the counter where thesmallest children could witness our enormous capacity to take pleasurein others pain.Go figure!
