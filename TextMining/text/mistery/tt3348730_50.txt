Now, the Officials are chasing thedead.Saw released in 2004 was one of the best Gore, Slasher Suspense HorrorThrillers. After the completion of film school, Director James Wan withhis friend Leigh Whannell wanted to make a short film, but limitationshold their hands. Hence, they decided to make something that haslimited location, actors etc. This short film of 9 minutes gave greensignal to the Saw movie. But, the franchise was rated straight downfrom Part 1 to 7.This movie is from the Directors of Predestination (2014), SpierigBrothers... hold on, don't expect much. But, if you are a fan of Sawfilm, you can take a breath. Definitely this is not as bad as theprevious installments.Mostly, a cocktail of the previous films. The beginning was reallygood, it had hope and expectations about the movie. This dropped soon.But, managed to pick up towards the end.
