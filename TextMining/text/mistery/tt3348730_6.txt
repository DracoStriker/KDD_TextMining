I'm a huge fan of the Saw franchise & I never saw this coming a Prequelan a Sequel all rolled into one , my mind is blown away . Jigsaw isbrilliantly written as they all are , the traps are especially good &the twist was incredible "spoiler coming" that we were watching aprequel game all along ! and the reveal of Jigsaw so we think he'salive ! my jaw was on the floor ! the 7 years has been worth the waitas Jigsaw exceeded my expectation .
