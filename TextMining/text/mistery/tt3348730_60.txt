Tbh just a massive let down. I am a massive fan of all the saws to dateexcept this one...even took a hot girl to it for a date so I could holdher hand when she was scared, but the movie wasn't scary at all, ifanything it was funny OK. If anyone has the same intentions of taking ahot date to a scary movie so they can hold their hand when they'rescared, pick another movie. But yeah, horrible film.
