The Saw series get a lot of hate mostly because the film changed it'spsychological direction after the first 3 movies and turned it into apure gore Carnaval, with this film I expected that it would bedifferent given that it's been seven years since the last Saw film (SawVII), but the changes are not that big, the film still roams around thesame plot that we love, gore exists but this time it's restrained whichis for the best, the style of the film is more cinematic because thedirectors never worked with a Saw film before so you notice thedifferent styles of directing, but it has some good twists, I'm a hard-core Saw fan so I enjoyed it very much, I was just hoping for a mind-blowing comeback.
