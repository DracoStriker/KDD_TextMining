After 7 years since Saw 3D, I was curious to see how much the storywould be related to the ending of that film. To my surprise, they didnot do anything with that arc at all. In my opinion, this was a verygood option since I believe that arc was going on for too long andbecame very confusing. With this film, it felt fresh with newcharacters to watch. However, it seemed to use clichéd moments whichbecame predictable after seeing twists at the end of the first 7movies. The time change became evident after a while when viewing, butthe editing was clever to be convincing that Jigsaw was alive for mostof the movie. The film also felt as if it were trying to set up another series offilms towards the end, but also trying to stay independent. This methodcan work, but I felt like it was a little off. The production quality is much better than the films 5-7, and matchesthe idea from the first films. If there is enough for a Saw 9, and theyfix some of the issues with being independent, I believe the serieswill be good again
