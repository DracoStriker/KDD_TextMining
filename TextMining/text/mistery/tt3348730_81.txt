I liked this sequel, meticulously better than the previous one, I'm afan of the Saw franchise, I feel it was not enough, but it's veryacceptable, I'll list my observations:1- What happened to the gore?2- What happened to that ending? It's not bad, but it's very particularif we compare it with other Saw movies, apparently Jonh Kramer has manyapprentices.3- What happened to Hoffman?4- What happened to Gordon ?, I think they should have given camera tothem, but none was named, I think that in the next film (if there isone), they should do it, of course they will.I conclude saying that, this installment is a very good start to thefranchise after 7 years and that for us the true Saw fan, we should begrateful.
