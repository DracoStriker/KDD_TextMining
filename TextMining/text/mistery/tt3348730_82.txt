While 2010's Saw 3D/The Final Chapter seemed to send a death knell forthe Saw series, 7 years later a new film has emerged. Throughout themovie, many plot holes are presented, can be considered a major issuefor some horror fans, mostly those who are larger fans of thesemi-bloodless, physcological movies of earlier this year. If a viewerallows themselves to look past these, and simply enjoy the premise,they will find it as a solid sequel. Jigsaw is most likely to beenjoyed in the theater by hardcore fans of the saw franchise. Causalfans or general horror aficionados are more likely to benefit fromwaiting for the movie to be on video, or streaming it in a few months.VERY, VERY MINOR SPOILER THAN WILL ANNOY SOME FANS: While the movietakes place after Saw 3D, little attempt is made within Jigsaw tofollow up on the plot of the previous installment.
