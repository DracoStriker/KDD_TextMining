Right I am a big fan of this franchise... A real big fan so that when Iwas at the school I even made a film that is inspired by thefranchise... Even though I am not proud of the film considering it wastight on budget and time Eventually it was shown at numerous filmfestivals around the world because it was catchy, commercial andcurrent..So last week after seeing Jigsaw I was shocked to see my plot beingturned into feature length script,shot and presented to me in thecinema...Some might call this as plot similarity which I doubt... As even thewriters made the same mistakes as I did... ( Those flat characters inJigsaw... In a short film I had limited time to establish a characteranyway ) Secondly Both mine and Jigsaw twists the time... Which is the mainsimilarity... Which means the bodywork of the films are literally theSAME... Second thing to note is at first those bucket heads did not mean a lotto me... Why they were there to begin with... Until I spot the firstsimilarity about the plot...Literally my work is inspired from ice bucket challenge... So you nowknow where those bucket heads are coming from...Interesting coincidence one might even doubt if it is a coincidence oran indirect COPY & PASTE product...you can check my short on youtube under Game Of Death Terms &Conditions short film if you are a writer it would be easy for you tounderstand the similarities...let me know what you think...
