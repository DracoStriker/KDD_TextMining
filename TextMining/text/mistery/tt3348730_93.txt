I saw "Jigsaw", starring Tobin Bell-24_tv, The Quick and the Dead; MattPassmore-The Glades_tv, Son of the Mask; Callum Keith Rennie-Longmire_tv, Fifty Shades of Grey and Laura Vandervoort-Ted,Smallville_tv. This is the 8th movie in the 'Saw' franchise and yes, Iknow, the last one back in 2010 was called the final chapter but he'sback-you just can't keep a good man down. This is the first Saw moviethat has the character's name, Jigsaw, in the title. What is remarkableto me is that Jigsaw/Tobin was killed off in the third Saw movie butthe producers keep coming up with ways for him to make anappearance-and yes, they have an explanation here, too. This one startswith bodies turning up dead and all the evidence points to one man asbeing responsible, Tobin. Callum is the lucky policeman that gets totry and match wits with Tobin. Matt plays the medical examiner thatgets to autopsy all the dead bodies showing up-and some of them are inpretty bad shape. Laura is one of the lucky contestants that gets toplay Tobin's games, and yes, they are just as gruesome as always. Now Iknow that these movies are not for everyone-my wife hates them-but ifyou do like them, then you will probably enjoy this one, too. I know Idid. It's rated "R" for grisly bloody violence, torture and languageand has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes. I enjoyed it and wouldbuy it on DVD.
