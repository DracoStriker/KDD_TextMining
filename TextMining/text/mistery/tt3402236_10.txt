Diane and I viewed this beauty of a film this afternoon, and we boththoroughly enjoyed a magical cinema event: I use these words becausethe movie takes you out of your own reality and places you in anotherworld that is not macabre or dangerous but filled with beautifulpeople, costumes and settings. Perhaps the reader can tell that I love being removed from themundanity of our ordinary existence. This beautifully constructed filmfilled with marvellous actors who are dressed in gorgeous timelycostumes and set to work in spectacular train compartments and asked touse a perfect script will leave many cinema-goers anticipating more.If I were much younger, I would not hunger for the movies from theDirectors Period in the 70s and 80s when they were allowed to makeGreat Movies rather than only the money-men. In any event, see thisfilm for its sublime attractions painted by Kenneth Branagh.
