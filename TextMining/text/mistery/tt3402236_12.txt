I went to see Murder on the Orient Express last night and this is myreview. I am rating it 7/10 A quick overview of the film is that someone is murdered on the Orientand the worlds best detective played brilliantly by Kenneth Branaghmust solve this case with caution and intelligence. The film starts smoothly with some laughs produced by Kenneth. We meetevery character before the train journey and that's when the guessingbegins. I really enjoy a film that keeps you guessing and gives you a fewunexpected twists. The orient certainly delivers that. Pros: Few well timed laughs, Kenneth Branagh is fantastic, GuessingTwists, Being focused on what is going on Lovely scenery, Great castand an intense story.Cons: To be honest, with the type of film it is and plot. There isn'tanything bad I can say about it because it delivered Agatha Christie'sstory very well.An entertaining watch for those who like a mystery film with a strongcast and to be engaged throughout but getting you to guess at moststages of the film. I guessed loads but was wrong! Thank you and hope you enjoy this review
