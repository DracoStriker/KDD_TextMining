I was so looking forward to this remake.. Kenneth Branagh is so verytalented. His live action Cinderella was delightful, But this remakelooks beautiful but is so wordy and boring. For the first ten minuteswe are shown how clever Poirot is and after a lot unnecessary paddingeventually we get on to the train . With all its glory. Greatphotography. But there was virtually no character development; and thesound was so poor ( even At The Odeon Leicester Square) that I did nothave a clue what was going on.(which is partially why there are nospoilers.)In fact it was so dull I nodded off and woke up when themurder had been committed . So I did not have a clue who was dead.( sono spoiler! An hour had passed and the rest of the film trundled alonglike a slow goods train, whilst Branagh did his stuff. I think hethought he was playing in Shakespeare's Henry the fifth. For at thedenouement, he just went on and on and on with speech after speech, inthat phoney French accent which was like a bad imitation of MauriceChevalier. In fact had it been a musical, I was waiting for him toburst into song! Mercifully this travesty ended and we left. Incrediblydisappointed.The original1974 version and the Richard RODNEY Bennett score was suchfun which captured the light Agatha Christie feel. This was like a veryheavy plum pudding. Branagh alluded to Murder on thrnNile. Please NOKenneth . Go back to Disney
