I have watched the 1974 "Murder On The Orient Express" at least 7times, and although not my favorite Hercule Poirot film, it is one withgreat replay value. The 2010 episode of the David Suchet series suffersby comparison, and so does this latest remake. As a director, KennethBrannagh has some visual ideas (a shot near the end deliberatelyrecalls The Last Supper) and orchestrates some impressively fluidcamera movements, but he botches the most iconic sequence of theoriginal (the ritualistic re-construction of the crime), and he addsunnecessary "modernisms" (Poirot in physical action). As Poirot, he israther unconvincing, but you get used to him; none of the other castmembers stand out the way, for example, John Gielgud and Wendy Hillerstood out in the original (Daisy Ridley comes closest). The film hassweeping production values, but is short on atmosphere and detectivework. I enjoyed parts of it, and will probably add it to my AgathaChristie collection, but it really is a runner-up. **1/2 out of 4.
