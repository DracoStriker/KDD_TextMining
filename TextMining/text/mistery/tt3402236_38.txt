I was a huge fan of Kenneth Branaugh's early work. He was a fantasticdirector and made such great movies as Dead Again, Henry V and Much AdoAbout Nothing - but after he starred in the pitiful Wild, Wild West heseemed to disappear.Murder on the Orient Express is a Branaugh vehicle. Branaugh isfantastic in the film and his direction is spot on. This is Branaughshowing what he once showed in the past.While this movie has an all-star cast - Branaugh carries the entirefilm. Everyone has a fine contribution to the movie, but make nomistake Branaugh raises the bar on this film.Well worth watching.
