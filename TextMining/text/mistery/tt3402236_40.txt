I've come late to the game with this story! Having not seen theoriginal movie or read the book, I cannot attest to how this moviematches up by comparison. I can however say that I throughly enjoyedthis movie from beginning to end! It had the right amount of drama,intrigue, comedy, as well as perfect pacing. I really cannot say enoughgood things about this movie! The actors were believable and charming.The shooting was interesting and clever. It lacked the Hollywood actionthat I detest in these sort of crime dramas. It relies instead on theinteresting story and acting chops of everyone in the movie. A mustsee!
