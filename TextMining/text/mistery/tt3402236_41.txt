Branaugh's performance as Poirot closely followed Mrs. Christie'sdepiction of the Belgian sleuth. And the train is as much an actor inthe production as any of the other stars. I loved the set and theatmosphere and the film's pace! Made me want to book a trip. If anyonecan tell me what was the cake served in the dining car, I'd be muchobliged! Fans of the book will enjoy the film. Daresay, fans of the erawill too.
