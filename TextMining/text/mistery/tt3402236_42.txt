Firstly I admit I know the story and have seen the original movie sothere is no whodunnit element of this for me.If you don't I shall keep this spoiler free.The opening seemed a totally unnecessary way of introducing thecharacter of Hercule Poirot. Some pretty CGI enhanced scenes didn'treally do anything to capture the mood or time and place.Once we are all aboard the train sets off on it's journey. This iswhere I first noticed the music. I am a big fan of film music and lovethe way it can integrate with the story and lift emotions or heightentension, but here I had no idea what was going on. We had somechildlike stuff at the opening then we moved onto trad jazz and I beganto wonder if this was going to spoil my enjoyment. I managed to ignoreit and it was only at the end when I thought there was some emotivestuff that I appreciated it again. Unlike some I enjoyed Ms Pfeiffer'srendition over the closing titles.The one element that did distract me throughout the movie was the "lookat my fancy directing skills" with totally unnecessary shots and oddset ups just to add to the director's or DOP's showreel. The scenewhere Poirot walks through the train after boarding was particularlyoff putting.As we are introduced to each of the main characters there was a lot ofsilent movie style acting, or mugging for the camera, going on.The plot moves along, at times somewhat disjointedly. I would haveappreciated more rumination from Poirot and we seemed to get quitehurriedly to his resolution.The closing big speech, aka reveal, is done quite well although I don'tunderstand the symbolism of Da Vinci's Last Supper painting parallel.The performances were perfunctory and I am sure a nice time was had byall the cast as nothing seemed like hard work. A bit more effort on theaccents might have helped. Where was Leslie Odom Jr supposed to befrom? If, as hinted, we are moving towards another Agatha Christieremake on the Nile, I hope Poirot trims his moustache.
