Ever since I watched "Hamlet (1996)" I have been loving KennethBranagh's work, but lately his movies haven't really interest me, thankgod hes back at making great movies, I missed you Kenneth (even if younever left)."Murder on the Orient Express" started pretty average, nothingfantastic, but it was entertaining, slowly, the movie evolves into anengaging experience.We have some great performances here, Johnny Depp is always good,Branagh is amazing (obviously), and the other actors are also amusing.Daisy Ridley is surprisingly decent in this. Its the best movie I have seen this year. I had some problems with it,like I said, the beginning was nothing especial but it just makes thegreat parts stand out even more (now that I think about it, thebeginning may not even be as mediocre as I thought). Perhaps my bigger issue its the ending, not the execution of it, butthe message and its way of thinking, I am kinda of mad at it, but Ireally love the way it was handled. I guess I liked the fact that itmade ask some questions about the morality of it rather than the endingitself.
