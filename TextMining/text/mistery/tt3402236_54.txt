The exquisite cinematography alone was breathtaking. Combine thevisuals with deft, smart writing and you get an award worthy script.Each performance by the multitude of great actors was inspired. If youappreciate seeing a movie with more than just chase scenes and masskillings, then this is a must see for you. This is a double thumb-er inmy opinion. ? ???????
