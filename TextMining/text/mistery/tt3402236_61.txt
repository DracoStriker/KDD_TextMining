First things first: I haven't read Agatha Christie story. Shame on me.But I rather I'm lucky because it's really absorbing narrative andfinal minutes like a revelation. I didn't compare Branagh to Suchet,not even their masterpieces of moustache, I just enjoyed the film fromthe very beginning to the final minutes. So for those neophytes who arenot captivated by Christie yet it's a perfect start. And all that first rate actors don't just gathered together to havefun, they do actually act, I can't name no one who doesn't keep up.Gosh, guys, I suppose after all those almost identical super heroesblockbusters and catastrophe films MOTOE is like a fresh air withhuman, grim story and a extremely difficult question that everyone isto decide by thyself. This movie is rather stylized, I think, and Ilike it a lot. All the splendid views of railroad stations,Constantinople, mountains, marvelously detailed interiors and costumes,just amazing how much work was done to get it feel luxurious andappropriate at the same time. Once again, it's a marvelous movie and certainly worth a go.
