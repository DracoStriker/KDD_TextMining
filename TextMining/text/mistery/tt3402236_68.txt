I was disappointed by this movie, because it had a top cast, andundoubtedly a very good crew, but the movie is too static and tooboring. Of course, if you have never read Agatha Christies story youwill like her story, because it is unique. But the scriptwriter anddirector of this movie could have done so much more with the greattalents who were at his disposal. I do understand the fact that there'sa lot of money in the ticket sale at this moment, just because themovie uses the great name of Agatha Christie. I do see the good work ofthe camera men and the dedication of the actors, but ..the scriptwriterand the director haven't had any real inspiration to get the greatactors into their job: great acting. They were like puppets.
