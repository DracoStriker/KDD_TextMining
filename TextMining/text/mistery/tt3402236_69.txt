The true crime in this film is how badly Kenneth Brannaugh's hubrismurdered a nearly century-old classic character and made a tremendouscase for an ending to remakes, as this one totally spit on the 1974Sidney Lumet version as well as the novel.It's really a shame that Brannaugh once again used a film he wasdirecting to highlight himself as much as possible at the expense ofmaking a good movie. This could have been a modern day ensemble castre-telling of a classic tale. But thanks to Brannaugh, it instead was acomplete and unnecessary overhaul of a great story for the worse. Forsome reason, Hercule Poirot is now part James Bond, and while it wasone thing to add a little diversity to the cast, it was completelyridiculous to then add a ton of garbage about racism.If you're not very familiar with Agatha Christie you may find somethinggood in the film. But if you are a fan, do not bother wasting 2 hourson this complete and utter dreck.
