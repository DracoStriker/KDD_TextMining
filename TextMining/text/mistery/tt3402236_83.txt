This is Poirot as I have never seen him before. The whole film feelsfresh and helps introduce new generations to a classic tale of Christietwists.The winter atmosphere makes one wish to cuddle up by a fireplace andsip hot tea. All the shots either give a sense of the isolated coldwinter outside or the tense claustrophobia inside the train cabin.Each of the actors give quite good performances. For Branagh, DavidSuchet's Poirot is a hard act to follow not to mention anOscar-nominated turn by Albert Finney. However, he makes the Belgiandetective charming, witty, likable, and portrays all the brilliance thecharacter has to offer. Some of the other stand outs include anamazingly dramatic Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy and suspicious,Johnny Depp oozes all the vile traits for a putrescent man, and DaisyRidley plays a strong-willed and delightful character perfectly.This version goes in a not before seen direction by adding heart andemotion into not only the suspects, but even the detective himself.This is rarely seen in other incarnations, but Branagh gives chills ofemotions while others leave you in tears by the charged ending.This is a wonderful blend of classical and modern film that Branagh hasgotten so good at over the years with his Shakespeare adaptations. Iwill be happy to revisit this version of an old mystery again andagain.
