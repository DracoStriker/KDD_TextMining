Murder on the Orient Express is a classic detective novel by AgathaChristie released in 1934 featuring the famous Belgian detectiveHercule Poirot. There have been quite a few film adaptations of thenovel, the most known probably directed by Sidney Lumet in 1974.Everyone who have read the novel might not be too excited about thisfilm version. Kenneth Branagh does a good job playing the famousdetective but if you are used to David Suchet's Poirot, better prepareyourselves to see something different here.The film itself is very well made, the photography is beautiful, aswell as the costumes, all the acting stars do not disappoint and thestory is nicely presented. When closing credits start rolling it says"Based upon the novel by Agatha Christie" and I think it is importantto keep that in mind. It is simply a version of the story and thedetective imagined by the director and the writer of this film so notevery single detail from the novel is followed. With that being said,it is still a nice viewing experience. I would especially recommend itto all of you not familiar with the story, I believe you will enjoy it.
