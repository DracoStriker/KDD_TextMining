I saw the star-stunned 1974 film version of Agatha Christie's famous1934 novel, so I knew the outcome of the equally star-stunned 2017remake, but I still found it an enjoyable ride through the snow. It hasto be said that the plot is massively contrived and the whole thingsags somewhat in the middle, but the cast and direction make the workeminently watchable. Heading the cast is Kenneth Branagh as the Belgian master detectiveHercule Poirot and he is splendid in his clever deductions, while it isa special pleasure to see the return to the screen of Michelle Pfeifferwho is particularly good in a cast-list that also includes male starsJohnny Depp, Willem Dafoe & Derek Jacobi and female talent such as JudiDench, Daisy Ridley & Penélope Cruz. The director is Branagh who offersus a flashy production with lots of soaring camera-work and plenty ofcolour and noise.
