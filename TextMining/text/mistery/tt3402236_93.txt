The Story evolves around Hercule Poirot(Kenneth Branagh) a detectivewhile riding a train, is suddenly pulled off of his vacation when apassenger(Johnny Depp) is murdered, has he investigates the murdered,and questions the passengers, he discovers there is more to thepassenger then his murder.I really liked this, Branagh really shines as Poirot, puts on a perfectBelgium accent to the point I forgot he was British, and also hasdirector. Johnny Depp is also good, I mean the amount of time he's oncamera, you really get a feeling he's up to no good. The rest of thecast are also good, everybody works well together. Perfect music isplayed well when tensions builds.
