I need to sit down to watch the other Hercule Poirot actors who hadplayed the famous Belgium Agathe Christie detective. But really KennethBranagh does quite well accent and with wit and charm.As he can be fussy but he is smart. And he tries to get in some restafter doing one case, but then he does not go to the case but the casegoes to him on the you guess it, Orient Express.As a despicable person who has ruined so many lives, is found murderedas will not give you who it is and who done it as need to see it foryourselves.But that are twelve people on board in all different walks of life andnothing in common except murdering the despicable person. As it couldbe anybody on the train. And that Poirot must postpone his rest and getthe bottom of what happened and why the murder was on the train and themotive.Ranging from a doctor(Leslie Odom), the man's butler(Derek Jacobi), alawyer by trade(Josh Gad), a professor(Wiliem Dafoe), a socialite(JudiDench), and a Governess(Daisy Ridley who proves to have a future beyondStar Wars). Among the culprits. As this man also seemed to be a criminal himself and rubbed people thewrong way. Will the great detective do so or will he be defeated? Asfor those that have not read the book or seen the original movie or TVshows, prepare for a surprise. Kenneth B does it acting and directing!
