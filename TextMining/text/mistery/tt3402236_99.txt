Let me first say this: many negative comments here are based oncomparison with the previous adaptation of the book Murder on theOrient Express. My review is based on this version the way I justviewed it on the big screen. And even though the story may be known,even though it's a star vehicle with a group of big names and not allof them get the time to truly show their strength, it works in my eyes.Why? Because of the spherical way it has been filmed. In a way, itreminded me of the Grand Budapest Hotel. And I have to say, I loved it.The book was written for entertainment, the first movie was made forthat and this movie has just one purpose and that's entertainment. Agood night with visual pleasure. Not to find out who did it, most of usalready know. It's the way it is found out that matters. People who sayit was an unnecessary remake in my eyes are in love with the firstversion and rightfully they are. But that does not make their reviewobjective. If you have an open mind, if you like to be entertained.Then go watch this movie and have yourself entertained. For me, it wasa pleasure from start to end. Only negative... it's a bit short. And inthe end, Michelle Pheiffer can sing a nice tune during the end credits.
