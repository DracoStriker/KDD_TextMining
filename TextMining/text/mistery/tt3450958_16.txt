I've walked out of movies before, but never have I walked deeper anddeeper into total disdain for over 2 excruciating hours. Completelyconvoluted and nearly nonsensical plot, wrapped in a farcical attemptto be profound, while being utterly transparent in its attempt to copysome iconic movies and characters (Ape-ocalypse, really?!). This totalmonkey poo is actually what will wipe out our species by making us allstupider with every passing minute we watch it. Life is too short, godo something more worthwhile, like watching paint dry. That said, hadsome moments of real emotion coupled with top-notch CGI. And, ittotally succeeds in making critics look like total morons.
