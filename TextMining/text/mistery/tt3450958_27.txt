Basically, don't waste your time watching this film. I don't know whythe rating on IMDb and rotten tomato for this film is so high. As aresearcher in computer vision and graphics, I can appreciate how goodthe cgi is but still the film maker is wasting their money and resourceto make a film which tells a rubbish story which didn't developnaturally. Lots of things in the film are just against common sense andfells the film maker is trying to make fun of the viewer. Such a badmovie, I don't want to waste even one more second for it!
