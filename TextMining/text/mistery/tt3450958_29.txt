Typical Hollywood. Two sets of American armies, both considered theenemy in the movie and their opponents are the always the good guyswhomever they are. And of course, the National Anthem and the flag haveto be strongly associated with evil acts! Never again will I seeanother Planet Of The Apes or this director's or producer's movies.Give it up. We are the good guys or have you pulled your head out ofhiding long enough to notice!
