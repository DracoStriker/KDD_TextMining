I've seen the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston andRoddy McDowell, I've seen the remake with Tim Roth, I've seen thousandsof films during my life. War for the Planet of the Apes seemed to me assimply a showcase for the digital ape effects.It's full of closeups of different digital ape faces against a blurrybackground. Af if it's 1957 and we should be marveling at newDisneyland animatronic characters. It's full of distant shots ofdigital chimps scurrying around. That's most of the movie.What people are saying is thought provoking, is a simple illustrationof two groups in conflict. Draw comparisons to Nazis and Jews, blackand white, Shia and Shi'ite, slave and slave owner. The same "thoughtprovoking" questions arise.The only difference here is that it's put into a science fictioncontext - what if apes were as smart as humans? Well, what if catswere? Or squirrels? Had this been an action film, I'd say OK, it's anaction movie and it's fine. But it isn't. It has some action, but isnot an action film. It's mostly a very slow moving, dull, inarticulatedrama.Inarticulate in two ways. A lot of the apes use sign language insteadof speech, and the script is not clever or intellectual. A few flashesof well written dialog come up during an exchange between the Colonel(Woody Harrelson) and Caesar (digital ape) and that's all there is.Less than five minutes. The rest of the dialog is mainly focused onvengeance and war or merciful understanding. There's no complexity orintellectual stimulation here.I'm shocked that nearly all professional film critics give this movie ahigh rating and praise. Perhaps they all received $5,000 checks fromthe film studio.
