The apes are well done but somehow elicit less empathy than Disneyanimated characters. Scenes that are supposedly moving or sad drag onand on. Some fight scenes are good but when monkeys got hit, somehow Ifelt no pang. CGI is impressive but I don't go to the movies for thatand I still don't know what it was about apart from references to thestory of Moses and hints to the holocaust. A mess.
