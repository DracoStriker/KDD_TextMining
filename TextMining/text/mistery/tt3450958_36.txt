I am a huge fan of sci fi and planet of the apes, which fits into thiscategory. But unfortunately I found this movie just plain boring anddifficult to keep up with. The subtitles made it impossible to fallasleep during the slow parts, which where constant. cinematography wasamazing, and the CGI was excellent. But unfortunately the story linelacked and I had hoped that Woody Harrelson would be the key to thismovie's success, but it just lacked any luster to keep me entertained.I unfortunately bought it on I-tunes, and can now no longer return it.Sad sad movie. Maybe the new star wars will restore my faith in sci fi.
