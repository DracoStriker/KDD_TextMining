Plot was just missing everything, no character development, you have nobackstory or connection with any character but then the movie woulddrag out every scene as if we were supposed to be at the edge of ourseat every second, except I wasn't. The bad character development andover dramatic scene making creates the perfect movie to fall asleep in,you will start feeling bored and exhausted after only 20 minutes andsince it is a long movie you will either feel this way the whole movielike I did or you will be lucky enough to watch this pile of garbage onthe plane where you can wake up and the movie will be over. The onlyreason I gave it a score of 2 is because there has to be at least onemovie out there that is worse than this one. It started bad, had a badplot, had no drama, no character development, had horrible attempts attension, horrible solutions to problems, it all ends exactly as your 8year old would have predicted, maybe the Producers preschooler wrotethe plot. Yes it was that bad. Humans and apes? battle for the planet?I wish, except it wasn't, it was just pathetic.Oh and the worst part is the embarrassingly high reviews for thisstinker. Too bad the Internet has become overrun with armies of paidshills, This movie, were it to be honestly rated by people thatactually have seen it, would likely be less than 2 because I gave it atwo out of pity.
