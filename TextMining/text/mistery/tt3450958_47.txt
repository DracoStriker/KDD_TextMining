I enjoyed this film and found quite familiar with the taste of editingstyle. This film is originally a job of Mr.Stan Salfas, ACE! Hisediting is strictly based on storytelling methodology of Robert McKee. His beautiful cuts in this film are the sequence in which Caesar'sfamily killed by the Colonel. The close ups between Caesar and theColonel are well managed in the most tragic moment. On the other hands,it is when Caesar was suddenly shot after the death of the Colonel insilence. Caesar is a typical oppressed nation's leader, and the Colonel is aclassical imperialist army officer. Mr.Salfas's reverse cutting revealsthis core conflict. What I appreciate is that US films reveal theevilness of imperial acts taken by its politicians. Self-criticism isdone by filmmaking. Moreover, it successfully turned into theblockbuster entertainment. Individualism and anti-imperialism attitude are quite strong, and othersub characters need more intelligence. Caesar and the Colonel are toobig. I prefer more anti-imperialism, and more collectivism. Fortune isnot religiously decided but it cannot individually be controlled. Whatwe can do is do our best efforts under difficulties. At least, the apesexpressed this thought. I love this film more than Godzilla! 10 out of 10!
