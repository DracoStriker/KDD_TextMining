Halfway into the movie, I wished I could be magically transported intothe movie itself as one of the apes... then hopefully be shot andkilled so that I could be put out of my misery. The only reason I didnot walk out is because I was with my family and I mistakenly thoughtthat they were enjoying the movie. However, as soon as the creditsstarted to roll, my husband announced, "Thank God it's over. That wasthe worst movie I've ever seen!" All of us agreed. I am so sorry tohave wasted that money, but I'm even sorrier about wasting the timethat I could have spent doing something else -- ANYTHING ELSE -- withmy family. The kicker was when my 11-year-old son sadly concluded thathe no longer likes movies. Likewise, my 20-year-old son did not have akind word to say about it. We've never agreed on anything so stronglybefore as a family unit. What a shame that we couldn't have bonded oversomething else.
