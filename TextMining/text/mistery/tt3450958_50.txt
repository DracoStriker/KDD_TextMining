This is a humiliation for a series we all loved and adored. Ceasor'scharacter is completely downsized. There is NO WAR in the film. Theending is bogus and outright stupid. There are hardly any dialogues.The entire film is like a slideshow where characters take a lifetime tocomplete an action. By the end of first half, I could hear bunch ofpeople snoring and the rest complaining why they bothered watching thefilm. This film deserves a Razzi. The only silver-lining is the first10 minutes. How can you fail so miserably despite have such an amazingproduction value?
