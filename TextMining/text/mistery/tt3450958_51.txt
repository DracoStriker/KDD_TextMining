I'ts shameful they where able to create such a bad movie so many scenejust don't make sense even when 2 characters talk the background musicthat supposed to be heard just not there . I really loved the 2previous one - they done perfectly as needed. but this one - it lookslike low cost production. I say they should return me the time i spendof life for this movie. the only thing good about this movie - is thatit was over.
