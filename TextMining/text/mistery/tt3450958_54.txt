This movie had everything going for it. 1 good and 1 amazing movie inthe franchise, fantastic CGI and great cinematography.It opens up with a skirmish in the forest and you can just marvel atthe action scene which is extremely beautifully filmed in long andsteady shots. What a change!After how Dawn managed to make you empathize as much for the humans asfor the apes (Gary Oldman and Andy Serkis carried it...), it lead to anepic confrontation where the apes assaulted the human city. THIS iswhat I expected from War, but in bigger.I wanted to see how the apes, particularly Ceasar, would be forced toabandon their pacific policies and put an end to humanity. How humansand apes would face-off in one big final clash. How we would root forboth humans and apes making the film an emotional roller coaster, etc.SPOILER: All we got in the end was an anti-army, anti-Christian,anti-US film that thought so highly of itself that it lingered on forages on random stupid scenes. Gorilla gives flower to girl, Gorilladies in the next scene. Colonel picks up doll, colonel cannot speak inthe next scene. Avalanche finishes off humanity (wait what...?). I just believe that after the success of the 2nd installment praisedfor both its CGI but also its very compelling and emotional scenes(when Gary Oldman turns on his ipad...), the director suddenlyconsidered himself a genius and thought he could do no wrong. He waswrong. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was simply a high class popcornaction movie, but a popcorn action movie non the less - War for thePlanet of the Apes forgot about that. A bit like The Hunger Games,after the second amazing installment combined social message withaction, the director thought people went to the cinema for the socialmessage...Extremely disappointed, do not watch it...
