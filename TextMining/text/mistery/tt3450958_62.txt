My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library.Picture and sound are great, the several explosions made my viewingroom shake. Of course you need a good powered subwoofer for that.This all started, moviewise, with the 1968 "Planet of the Apes", basedon an earlier French book. In that story 20th century space travelerssomehow zip to the far future where Apes are the intelligent speciesand what we know as Humans are the ones captured and caged. At the endwe see the remnant stubble of the Statue of Liberty and realizesomething very bad happened on Earth.The current series of Apes movies actually fill in that space in timebetween a catastrophic event and the rise of the intelligent Apes. Inthis version it isn't a war, it is Simian Virus stemming fromexperiments with caged Apes.The Ape leader is again Andy Serkis as Caesar, raised from very youngby a human family, and as a mature Ape speaks well and has humanqualities. All the surviving Apes want to do is live peacefully intheir home in the forest.That plan is upset by Woody Harrelson as the rogue military Colonel. Heand his men seek to exterminate the Apes and that conflict is the coreof the story here. We can look at it as sheer entertainment, we sensethat Apes becoming human-like is just a Sci-Fi fantasy. Or we can lookat it as an allegory, those with power seeking to dominate others.The cutest character is an Ape named "Bad Ape" and played by SteveZahn. He had learned to talk and when in captivity had often beenyelled at "bad Ape" so he came to think that was his name. A wrinkle inthis story is that the virus gradually allows Apes to develop theability to speak, and at the same time gradually renders Humans unableto speak.It runs over two hours but never seems long.
