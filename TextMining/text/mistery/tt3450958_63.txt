No amount of progress in CGI facial expressions can make up for anunimaginative story and a clumsy script. A better screenwriter couldhave done so much more with this premise. As it stands, this is justanother example for film class on an over-reliance of technique oversubstance.It was impressive to see a vaguely chimpanzee face make humanexpressions. There are lots of micro-expressions and nuances a humanviewer could appreciate. They clearly worked very hard at it. They areclearly very proud of it. But after a while the movie seemed like ademo-reel for those wizards. It is no surprise that the extras gostraight into a facial CGI documentary slash fundraiser. The dialog is trite and uninspired. And this just draws attention tohow far the art has to go. The uncanny valley is wide. We have notcrossed o'er. The walking, running, fighting, falling, are all stillcampy and cartoonish. If it only told a good story then maybe thismovie would not be unwatchable in another ten years.
