This film concludes an epic story and a wonderful trilogy. If you can,watch all 3 films at once. The filmmakers for the three films reallydeserve more credit than they have received so far, and as for thenegative reviews, watch it yourself and make your own mind up. You'llfind that most of the negative reviews are well far of the mark...these movies are as rewatchable as the batman trilogy in my opinion,and i hope they continue the story further.
