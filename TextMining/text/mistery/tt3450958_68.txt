Let me just go out and say this this movie is the most underrated movieof ALL TIME (at least for me).Such a fantastic movie one of my all time favorites. Complexcharacters, brilliant writing, fantastic VFX, And action is fromanother world only.The film has so many things to explore that I will not be able toconfine it in just 1000 words but keeping short.I feel myself so unlucky not to experience it in cinema.All actors are fantastic but I wished to see more of woody. He lookedfantastic and acted very well as well.But I see some negative reviews here from people as well. My onlyrequest to anyone who is reading this is at least watch it once andthen decide your verdict because this movie deserves to be seen, a trueMASTERPIECE.A special mention to the unbelievably brilliant, beautiful andthrilling action set-piece in the end. I had GOOSEBUMPS in the climax.I didn't expect to see such thrilling action in an otherwise such acompelling drama. The best action scene in a long time as far as Iremember.Watch it once, if possible on Blu-ray but watch it and decide foryourself.
