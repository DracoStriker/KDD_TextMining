It appears the apes have all been castrated. What cruelty. Isn't PETAgoing to say something?Also, the apes used in this movie have unusually long torsos. They lookunnatural.As for plots, it is full of plot holes. So don't think too hard whenwatching.The Nova character is completely unnecessary. I thought somethingimportant was going to happen with her, but nothing. They could easilydelete this character and fill her role with someone else.Basically they run out of good plot but want to milk this planet of apeidea. Hence this movie.
