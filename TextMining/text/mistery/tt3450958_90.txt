Woody Harrelson is the Colonel, and he channels Brando's Kurtz fromApocalypse Now,as he has gone off the deep end. After killing Caesar'wife and son, the lead ape is on a mission to settle the score, muchlike an old Clint Eastwood spaghetti western. Again, as with theprevious ape film from 2014, it is much too long at two hours andtwenty minutes. Does anyone know the meaning of the word editing?Otherwise, it is the classic battle of good versus evil between Caesarand the colonel. Woody is great, as usual, and Andy Serkis reprises hisrole from the last Ape movie, and he again equal to the task. Thevisuals are stunning, and the action non stop. Other than theaforementioned length of the film, if you have some time to kill thisis one entertaining ape fest.
