After Christopher Nolans Batman Trilogy. Planet of Apes is probably oneof the best trilogies, I've seen. Very well written and logicalstoryline. Connect with the audience and shows how ruthless humans havebecome. I would suggest everyone watch all the three movies.Caesar'scharacter is beautifully portrayed.
