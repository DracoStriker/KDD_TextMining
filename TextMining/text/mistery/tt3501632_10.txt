I ve heard good things about Logan,spider man hc,guardians 2.And theyall turned out pretty good for me in different ways.Logan is the first hero movie that made me cry.Yondu's death had a hugeemotional impact on me(even more than superman's death in BvS).Thathuge twist about vulture being Liz's.And now this spectacular Thormovie.I am broke now,thanks to you marvel:).After this movie,the hulk grew on me so much.Finally they gave him somepersonality.Loki,Hela both were pretty good.Easter eggs weresurprising.Both funny and emotional at the same time.They showed the devastatingevents in Ragnarok pretty well.You should definitely watch this movie in 3D,visuals were also amazing
