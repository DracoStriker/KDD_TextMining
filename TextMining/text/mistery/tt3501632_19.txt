I thoroughly enjoyed this film- credit must go to the fantastic humour,excellent direction and art direction- a great example of translatingcomic art into film, and finally, the stunning Cate Blanchett who stolethe show over other highly commendable performances. The cast overall is perfectly assembled, especially the new TessaThompson as Valkyrie!Kudos to Taika Waititi for helming a project this size and deliveringan example of how to do it right.
