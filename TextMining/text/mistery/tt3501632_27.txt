Thor is at his comedic best with a great cast and great directing. Iloved all the subtle references to the origins of thor in the comics(eg, the umbrella Mjolnir, rune thor with one eye) as well as in norsemythology. Great research! Keeping it light is what it needed, as thereare too many marvel movies with "end of the world" scenarios. Greatfun!
