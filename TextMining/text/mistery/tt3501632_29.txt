This movie was a really solid one. It was really funny and and justlots of fun. I didn't like the first 2 Thor movies that much and thisis obviously the best one so far and probably one of the best mcumovies. Taika Waititi did a really good job both directing and voicingthe funniest character in mcu history probably. His character Korg wasprobably the funniest character in the movie, his lines werehilarious,he had the funniest accent ever probably. And all thecharacters were really good. Hela is probably my favorite mcu villainright now. Cate Blanchett is really good in this movie, she is reallysexy, funny and intimidating and her little fight with the Asgardianswas really fun and cool. Chris Hemsworth was also really good in thishe was really funny and had more character to him compared to the otherThor movies. Jeff Goldblum was awesome in the movie. Karl Urban wasreally good (I couldn't realize him in his character). Tessa Thompsonwas great. Tom Hiddleston, Mark Rufallo and Idris Elba were great asalways. This movie had a basic plot and story that was just fun. Alsothis movie was visually stunning (not BR2049 stunning but very pleasingin that regard. Had really cool set pieces and action. Soundtrack wasalso really pleasing with its synth wave-y 80's feel and pretty muchthe whole movie had the 80's feel with neon color usage. I don't havemuch problems with it and I definitely would recommend seeing thismovie if you have the time.
