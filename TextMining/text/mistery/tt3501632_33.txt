Thor Ragnarok is an absolute ball of a film: it's the MCU's mostenjoyable film since the first Guardians of the Galaxy film, anddoesn't focus too much on sequel building like previous MCU films.Ragnarok is the kind of film that will appeal to even the most ardentlycynical critics of superhero movies; it's stupid but it relishes in itsself-aware sense of joy and fun.Ragnarok is eons ahead of Thor: The Dark World in my eyes, and is evenbetter than the first Thor. It's one of those rare 'threequels' that'sbetter than the films which came before it. And considering howsupposedly 'formulaic' people are starting to perceive the MCU films,that's saying a lot of great stuff about this movie. Thor: Ragnarok hasthe mythological scale of something like The Lord of the Rings, theover-the-top fun of Richard Donner's Superman movies, and the extrasprinkling of The Hulk in a gladiator costume to top all this insanityoff in a perfectly gorgeous combo. Oh, and it accomplishes theother-world-liness of films like The Star Wars Trilogy.Thor: Ragnarok is the Thor film I've been waiting for easily. It usesthe character in a way that we unfortunately had to wait several filmsfor to justify this payoff, but I promise you the payoff issurprisingly satisfying.
