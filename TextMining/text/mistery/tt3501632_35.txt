Without a doubt, this is one of the best films that Marvel has producedwithin the last decade and certainly the best sequel of any Marvel filmproduced.Excellent script, excellent storyline, excellent casting, excellentscore.'Thor: Ragnarok' is testament to the fact that Marvel is capable ofproducing sequels to what should be a 're-run car crash' by now. Thefilm is thoroughly enjoyable, full of nostalgia, self-mockery andplenty of laugh-out-loud moments.This is one for the big screen.
