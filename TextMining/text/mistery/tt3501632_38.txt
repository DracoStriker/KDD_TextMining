I've always loved Thor since I was a child. I used to go around thehouse with a hammer in my hands. Unfortunately, the two previous Thormovies were not so great but boy this one, wow! Ragnarok is so muchfun; enough action but not too much to drive me to boredom, sensitivemoments and so much funny moments. I really loved it.
