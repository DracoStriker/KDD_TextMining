Let's get rid of this ""Aw,but the Ragnarok event in mythology hasgreat battles, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a numberof major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr,and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters"" nonsense.Causethese movies don't have to stick to the myth or comic books,100%.Theyshould make changes for the sake of the movie.For instance,in NORSEMYTH,fenrir(the giant dog) is the son of Loki and hela is also thechild of Loki. Now tell me how the hell Marvel is gonna show us Helaand Fenrir as Loki's children??Loki is already a well established andgrounded character.At this point,I don't think any director/writercould change Loki's past and introduce Fenrir and Hela,as Loki's kidscause this would also bring tons of questions,plot holes and flaws.For the sake of MCU continuity,Marvel HAD TO make changes in the NorseMyth and in the comics.The performances of the main cast are impressive and exceptional.Thismovie also showed us the real "God of Thunder".For the first time hewas extremely powerful without his hammer.That lighting streaming allover his body was pure awesomeness.This movie is mostly targeted for everybody except forjoyless,moody,edgy people who are allergic to have fun and have aboring,dull life. The CGI,fight scenes,epic battles,monsters etc..kindaremind me LOTR.Also,when I ve read the first reviews of this,some critics werepraising the soundtracks too.Wow..they were completely right thismovie's soundtrack list is on the same level with GotG 1 which wasperfect.They finally gave hulk a personality.Even though he looks allbig,formidable and scary,he was kinda adorable every time he talks:).Soglad they finally made him talk.They really improved his CGI.The bestversion of Hulk in MCU.The haircut made him better too.Tessa Thompson surprised me with her performance.I still hear somepeople complaining about the color of her skin.Cause she doesn't looklike Valkyrie in myth.Well,she doesn't have to actually.All I careabout is,her performance.And she did really good.So put another major hit on MCU.They did it again.We have another MCUmovie approved by critics and audiences.They have successful trackrecord since 2008.Unlike some people's petty,shallow claims,I don't think marvel isalways using the same formula again and again since 2008.Cause if theyfallowed that path since 2008,people wouldn't watch their movies forthe past 9 years.And they definitely couldn't create thehighest-grossing franchise of the planet without their major playerslike Fantastic 4,X-men and Spider man.
