Loved it! Busting to go to the loo (far too much Diet Coke)! but didn'twant to miss a minute of this cracker of sparky and sparkly joyousromp. There was so much to laugh about in the car home, from thebromance between Hulk and Thor, the wonderful scene steeling Korg, (seeya new Doug!) Jeff Goldblum hamming it up as only he can through to thebattle scenes using Led Zeps Immigrants Song and Tom HiddlestonesLoki's comedic facial grimaces. When a movie is talked about in the carhome with my family, it's a sign we all enjoyed this, big time! Lasteduntil the end then - ahhhh the relief!! Two after credits scenes, onefairly important to the next movies in the MCU, the other just funny!
