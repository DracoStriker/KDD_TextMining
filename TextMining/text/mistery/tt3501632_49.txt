I have to admit this blew me away , I wasn't expecting to enjoy it butthis was a really funny enjoyable piece of entertainment. Definitely worth seeing . This is not my genre but this will appeal to those who love films likethe LOTR trilogy as well as those who love the humour in Guardians ofthe Galaxy . Jeff Glodblum stood out as Grandmaster. As well as the Stonerevolutionary South African gladiator . Kate Blanchet was superb , there was even a small cameo role forScarlet Johansen completing the Avengers assemble . As a complete novice to the genre and knowing very little about thefranchise - it came across as a mix of Sci Fi ( of the Star Wars ilk )mixed with myth and fantasy tied together by an excellent script andgreat comic lines .Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleson were great as was the Hulk / Bannerand Valkyrie . The only let down was Anthony Hopkins - his performancewas below par for such an excellent actor . Plenty of action and CGI for those who like their cinematic fix .It's a film I'd definitely see again maybe in 3D or in the recliningseats :) Pad.A 9/10
