This review of Thor: Ragnarok is spoiler free**** (4/5)LIKE CHANTING BETELGUISE'S name, for Marvel products the phrase thirdtime's a charm really works, of course well-earned nods to brotherdirectors Anthony and Joe Russo's Captain America: Civil War whichaccomplished all fears for its enchanting, eye-shattering Leipzigairport battle scene having the heroes involved showing what they cando, the standout there was Black Panther and the introduction of thenewer, younger much improved Spider-Man. Then we had Shane Black's turnat Iron Man 3 which vastly improved on its predecessor. Now the thirdand final entry in the Thor series is one of the most ridiculous, mosthilarious adventures Marvel has ever produced, it's essentially likeeating a badger sandwich, and no we don't know what that is either. This daftness comes from none other than New Zealand-born directorTaika Waititi, who over the last few years has created some of the mostbizarre adventures ever told in cinema with his hilariousvampire-mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows and secondly Hunt ForThe Wilderpeople which had a stunning performance from Sam Neill in ahat made from a collinder. However Thor: Ragnarok is his mostridiculous adventure yet.After Chris Hemsworth's Thor is hurled from the bifrost he's capturedon a strange planet which from first glance is obviously the universe'strash can, under the rule of Jeff Goldblum's daft, yet tyrannicalGrandmaster who looks like he just wears anything he finds in the 80sfactory complete with a blue line under his lip and comes with a lot ofGoldbluminess, he's funny as hell - he gives Thor the ultimate fightagainst his champion - Hulk's (Mark Ruffalo) welcome is really nosurprise but comes with a roundhouse of applause particularly with thewell-drawn hand-to-hand combat in a Star Wars-esque gladiatorialcoliseum which can't escape Thor's scream of joy and a few quick-wittedjokes to get you going. Meanwhile on the other side of the universe theAsghardians are held for a fight for their survival after a viciousattack from Cate Blanchett's goddess of death Hela looking a tad likeAlice Cooper's twisted sister complete with a horned helmet forferocity. Sadly her performance is the film's weakest point, shedoesn't exactly come with Galadriel's strength or depth she's notMarvel's best villain, though a better improvement over Thor: The DarkWorld's Dark Elves. She's not in many scenes and when she does appearher delivery is often heavy-handed and empty with little feeling.The script penned by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost isan improvement over the previous instalment too - the funnier scenesare along the same lines as James Gunn's unadulterated joy forGuardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, here there are arse gags and penisgags aplenty which is a vast improvement over the previous two films'barrier for serious face the actors are allowed to let loose here.Particularly the shared chemistry between Thor who hates having hishair cut, Hulk angry as ever and Tessa Thompson's surly Valkyrie whocan't stop drinking yet comes with a humanizing story giving herperformance some emotion. Yet there's humour to them too they eachshare their time with the whims and the jokes that the script has tooffer, the three arguing in a room with an angry Hulk and a teamedfinal fight are obvious standouts. Sadly, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't come without its flaws it's not utterlythunderous throughout the last few minutes of the final fight are alittle CG heavy there's a lot going on in a few shots it can bedifficult to follow a certain point which watching in 3D can be onoccasion daunting to the eyes. Though there is some goodness the CGimages on show, here the destruction of Asghard though upsetting forthe fans who have stayed with the series is thoroughly stunning plusthis is the most impressive vision of Hulk yet, he's still a wonder towatch from the outrageous gladiatorial combat, through the hilariousjokes he lets free to the film's final fight he's relentless andutterly charming. This is vintage Waititi he is clearly at home here inthe huge immersive worlds of space or the cramped space of Hulk'schamber he allows you to breathe with the world he has created here.The finale of the Thor series is one of the most intense, boldestadventures Marvel has ever created does it bring on the thunder? You'redamn right it does.VERDICT Daft, ridiculous and hilarious Waititi manages to retain hisunique brand of humour and goofball madness in this neon-infused 80sstyle finale.
