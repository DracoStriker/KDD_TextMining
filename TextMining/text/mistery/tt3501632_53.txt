Another win for Marvel. Phase three shows no signs of slowing down. The movies itself is a great stand alone film, but also does its partfor the wider MCU. Thor has evolved from the serious, god-likecharacter we knew after spending some years on Earth. His new foundhumor fits well without throwing away the development that has occursin previous appearances. The dynamic between Thor and Loki continues toflourish; the latter remains a key factor into the franchise success.Hulk/Banner gets enough screen time to warrant a spot in the title. Noone will ever tire of seeing Hulk smash on a scale as large as this.Stand out performance from Valkyrie. Excellent portrayal of alesser-known character that shall no longer be lesser-known.Grandmaster goes full Goldblum. That should be enough to sell you onthat character. Hela does not fit the mold of weak antagonist rolesfrom past Marvel movies. Too powerful to disregard with motives to backher actions. Epic actions scenes on a larger than life scale. Worth a watch in IMAX. Some overuse of comedy but it's what you come to expect from ablockbuster appealing to the masses. Not once does it distract you fromthe threat at hand. A nice set up for Infinity War without seeming like a prequel. 9/10.
