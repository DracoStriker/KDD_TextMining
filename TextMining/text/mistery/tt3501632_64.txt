A well paced fun and action packed film. Its what films based on comicsshould be like. Whilst it moves all over the place (as far as one sideof the Galaxy to the other) and flash backs in time could be confusingif not paying attention .. but to be honest I was glued to the screenand it all fitted in to the flow. One of , if not the best Marvel movie, certainly the best Thor by a long margin.
