30 October 2017 First Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Thor:Ragnarok. This is another outing for Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and avery welcome return it is too. Joining him is the enigmatic TomHiddleston as Loki, Mark Ruffolo as Banner/Hulk and Idris Elbareprising his role as Heimdall. We once again find ourselves immersedin a gladiatorial contest between good and bad with Thor the centralcharacter binding it all together. This outing to Asgard is very muchmore slapstick than the previous ones and there are many more momentsof genuine mirth amongst all the fighting and slaying. Having saidthat, it in no way detracts from the story and from the core charactersthat have formed the stable of Marvel stories over the years. Add oneJeff Goldblum as a larger than life caricature of himself into the mixand you have a thoroughly entertaining film. I want to see this againand soon. Oh and people......it's a Marvel film.....stay until the endof the credits!!!!!!
