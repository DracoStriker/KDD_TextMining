This movie was so much fun! Seriously the third funniest MARVEL movie,right after Deadpool and GotG#1. The cast were top notch, lots of puns,lots of great moments. Hulk got more screen time, Loki got hissatisfaction (no spoilers, but it was great!) and the music was veryfitting. 9/10. Totally worth your time and money!
