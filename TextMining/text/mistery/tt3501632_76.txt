Wow I was so hyped for this movie, I was sure it couldn't live up toit. But damn it was awesome to be blown away like that.For anyone who might not have loved the first two Thor movies, shouldnot let them keep you from seeing this one.It's so utterly different, colorful and funny, it's likeAvengers/Guardians mixed together.There was several truly epic scenes, and lot's of awesome action scenesthroughout the movie, with lots of humour and soul to it.The story worked well, without trying to be complicated, but enoughtwist here and there to keep the movie from feeling transparent.If you are looking for a funny and very entertaining movie, ThorRagnorock won't disappoint at all.Very likely to rank as the best MCU movie yet.
