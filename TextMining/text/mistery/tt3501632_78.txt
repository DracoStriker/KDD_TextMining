This movie shows something I've never seen in MCU. It's amazing for itsplot setting, pace, visual effect, music etc. They are telling the story right, and making it hilarious andexhilarating. Every role is developed and paid adequate amount ofattention. So glad to see that Hulk was finally given more personality. I also liked the female characters in this one, both very bad assfighters, no unnecessary romantic entanglement as the previous works.(I mean, it's not about Jane herself, she's fine, but was written in away that doesn't really fit in or helpful to the plot.)btw I watched it in BFI IMAX. It was such an experience! Would highlyrecommend 3D or IMAX for it's visual effects.
