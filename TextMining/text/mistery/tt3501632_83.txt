THE best Marvel movie to date. Fun, retro and interesting, accompaniedby an amazing music and picture quality. 3D is not a MUST but you wouldenjoy iMAX experience for sure!Story is way better than Thor 2 or even 1. Few plot twists and yes... 2post credit scenes. First 1 hour of the movie is by far the craziest,really cool stuff and last 20 min is also amazing. Overall movie keptyou engaged pretty much all the time. No dragging out
