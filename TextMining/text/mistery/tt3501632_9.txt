In the comics, Ragnarok killed every Asgardian, including Thor, and hewas gone for years from the comics. The darkest story in Thor'shistory.So of course Marvel Studios makes it a comedy.There is nothing to this movie but jokes. It's quips, pratfall, anusjokes, Hela's kind of lame, Hulk and Thor are a comedy duo. And Thorhelps Loki bring Surtur to Asgard so he can destroy it. Let me repeatthat in case I wasn't clear. THOR HELPS DESTROY ASGARD AT THE END.It's just so bad.Some of the action was really good, but the forced humor didn't work inthis movie.At least Marvel Studios has finally admitted that comedy is their mainfocus.Getting stellar reviews, of course. Because critics love the MCU andwill just pretend they're masterpieces when they're not. This movie wasterrible.Critics call it "FUUUUNNNN". But it was just lame.I wish I would have saved my money, or burned it. At least if I burnedit I still would have wasted money but I wouldn't have sat throughthis.It sets the final stage for Infinity War, which is going to be abloated mess.
