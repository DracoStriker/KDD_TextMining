The plot of this hulk sized film is imprisoned the mighty Thor findshimself in a lethal gladiatorial contest against the Hulk his formerally. Thor must fight for survival and race against time to prevent theall-powerful Hela from destroying his home and the Asgardiancivilization. They actually did it they did a Planet Hulk film i had tosay that because it pretty much is Planet Hulk and i have to say thatto me the story was really well told and really well paced which is tobe expected since the film is only two hours and ten minuets long.Returning as New Doug (if you don't get the joke then watch the film)is Chris Hemsworth , Tom Hiddleston , Cate Blanchett , Idris Elba ,Jeff uh ah uh ah uh ah Goldblum , Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo. Ihave to admit i loved the chemistry between Chris and Tom at this pointthey might as well be brothers and the same goes for Chris and Mark i'dsay the only one that Chris doesn't have chemistry with is someone ican't mention since it's spoiler. The rest of the cast do a solid job i know we make a lot of fun aboutJeff Goldblum but damn he was good in this film you can tell that hewas having a blast playing this character and i hope to god that we getto see more of him in future movies and once again Tessa kills it iloved her in Creed and i love her in this i'm calling it right nowshe's going to win a lot of awards.It's taken them awhile but finally Marvel have created another greatvillain at least in my eyes Hela was a true badass. The only real gripei have with her is more personal then anything and that's the fact hermotivation wasn't that clear others might think the opposite but that'smy opinion and she can actually beat people up and be an actualchallenge for our hero and i hated her helmet.Wow this film has a lot of humor and i do expect a lot of it to go overpeople's heads especially with the music choices but this film had melaughing out loud and hard we all know of the scene where Thor and Hulkfirst meet up and that's still funny but for me one of the best jokesin the movie is what happens after that scene and if you've seen thefirst Avengers movie you'll know why i laughed at that scene.Honestly at this point there's no point in my even talking about theCGI because we all know it's going to be good so instead i'll jumpright into the action which honestly was rather refreshing just due tothe fact that not a lot of it boiled down to who can hit who thehardest and there's a badass scene with Thor near the end of moviewhich i was going to make a joke about but then i thought it might be aspoiler.Damn the soundtrack for this film is really something and when i saythe soundtrack i don't mean the score used by composer MarkMothersbaugh.i mean the songs they inserted into the film i kid you notone of the scenes uses "Pure Imagination" from Willy Wonka while notone but two action scenes use "Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin and iwas OK with that.Overall i can't say this is the best Marvel movie because i think thereare better movies but i can safely say that this is the best Thor movieand the best Hulk movie for me this film gets an 8.5 out of 10.
