There are so many disappointments with this film, I don't know where tobegin. So I'll start here?first, the tag-line that, "you can't turnback time, but you can wind it up again" is not mentioned at all by anycharacter in this film. As it turns out, Lightning can't wind it upagain. **SPOILER ALERT** In fact, he is too old to finish the race andneeds a young girl car to do it for him. Did Disney not learn anythingfrom The Simpsons?? You don't have to age animated characters. From thepreviews, I was led to believe that Lightning would wreck, overcome hisimpediments to win the race and show us all that we can do anything weput our minds to. Instead, Disney, was so busy being PC by making agirl win that they actually WERE being ageist. When you pay to seeLightning win, and he doesn't cross that finish line, you have failedas writers. I will now move on to the poor characterization of Cruz.From the color chosen for her, her dialogue, her lack of humor orconnection-she was flat. Doesn't Disney have ENOUGH female heroes-heroines?? Did they have toretire one of the very FEW males-Lightning?? This was a colossallystupid decision.I guess Disney did not consult any child psychologists-or anyone withchildren-to find out that boys like cars more than girls. They haveeffectively ended their franchise. I feel the fizzle out coming. Somuch for the next generation of Lightning McQueen fans-I doubt manygirls are going to be asking for race tracks with Cruz for Christmas.
