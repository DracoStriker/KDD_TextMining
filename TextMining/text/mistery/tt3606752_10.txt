I am a huge cars fan, I absolutely loved the first movie, the secondmovie was still really good, but the first was a classic. This movie was an absolute disgrace to the first two. The writers weredifferent and they absolutely destroyed the atmosphere of cars. Theybrought in way to millennialist stereotypes and decimated the standardset by the first two movies. Things were misquoted from the first movieand characters were poorly developed. Don't waste your time or money.
