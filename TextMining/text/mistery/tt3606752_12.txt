What happened?... Are they trying to shutdown some "old" franchises?...this movie is a total anti-climax, you go in full of expectations andgo out trying to forget it... to keep the good old memories... it issad... they completely abandoned the universe created in Cars 1 and 2and all other spin-offs... they tried to do something new, a newperspective, but did not develop anything beyond a scratch deep...nothing makes any sense... no fun... no logical connection among storydevelopments... I will try to forget it... but it will be though... inthe end there is no hero left...
