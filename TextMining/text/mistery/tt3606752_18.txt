We all expect our lead character McQueen to win or do somethinginteresting every time but this movie is all opposite.... It's justabout his retirement..... It talks about new generation racers who arebetter than the old ones.... Everything McQueen had is hopelessness...He loses all hope and hands over his career to a girl racer makinghimself retired..... he declares himself shower than the others andtakes up a blue paint in memory of Hudson hornet and becomes a crewchief... Cars has always been my favourite Disney movies since mychildhood but thus movie made me real upset...I was really notexpecting this...... It is surely the worst Disney movie ever....
