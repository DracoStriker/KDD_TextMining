I wanted to like this movie based on the earlier ones and took mykids... was I wrong, it was awful. The whole movie is based on the redcar trying to get his mojo back because he's too old or needs work, andin the end he basically quits. And still gets called the "winner." Idon't like to overly analyze movies or entertainment and will watch andenjoy things with any reasonable message about self-empowerment, untilthat entertainment tries to shove a ridiculous message at people ---defeatist. More or less inane level propaganda, and about how NOT tosucceed at something at that. If you want to see a real comeback movie,and one that makes a little sense, just rent any Rocky. 1 through 7 (orwhatever they are on....) There are tons of other good ones.
