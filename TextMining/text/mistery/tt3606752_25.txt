The Movie reminds me Rocky 3, our hero loses face on a younger rival,his mentor does not exist anymore, it is necessary for him to findother reference marks.Whereas the one was an improbable film and supers funny ? The secondwas a pastiche of spy film, on the ecological wave with a beautifulcompetition between two cars so different but animated with the samedesire of victories.This one is too dramatic, lacks of jokes and genuine story line ? It isa mixture between a victorious come back and the hand-over between themaster and the rookie..So it is very confusing, the plot is then impossible and bad written?..how a car/pilot can finish a race started by another car/pilot ?At the end, I did not laugh and I did not like the plot
