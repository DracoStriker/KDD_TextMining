Our family has been big Cars fans since 2006. My boys(while outgrownthem) have tons of Cars toys. Their room is still decorated in thetheme. We've been to DL to Carsland 2012.Onto the film.I really only have 2 substantial issues with this film. 1. It's complete ignorance that Cars 2 ever happened. If Cars 2 didn'texist, this film on most ends could've fit in the series nicely. Youcan't take back the past... Cars 3 could've been a prequel... (with adifferent script entirely)2. The race switcharoo of Lightning & Cruz during a race. I mean,really?? This is beyond mind boggling to me that this was a good idea.She goes from a sorta clueless & naive personal trainer to better thanthe best race car in the world, who lets her switch places in themiddle of the race?I'm sure this film will appeal to some young families who don't knowthe series well or aren't critical of storyline progression or have anyknowledge of racing. My boys @ 11 were disappointed. They said itdidn't make sense. 5 out of 10 just out of respect for the artistry.
