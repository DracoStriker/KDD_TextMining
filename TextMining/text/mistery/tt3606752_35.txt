Cars 3 is not like the rest of the Cars movies, though it triesrecapture some glory from the first movie. Didn't mind the newcharacters, they were interesting in their own way. However, it wouldhave been good to also have some of the old characters in there aswell, and not just at the beginning and at the end. Other than that,the story is okay, with some action (though, they could have added somemore) and a great twist in the end, that, at least, helped pull themovie out of the cliché pit. Finally, the special effects were nice,with the cars almost looking like real ones, especially at certainscenes, where even the scenery looked real. So, overall, 4 out of 10.
