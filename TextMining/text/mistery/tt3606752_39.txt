As a huge supporter and fan of the first CARS film, and not caring atall for the 2nd, this one was phoned in, lacked the "SOUL" and interestof the original. The parts are there, the deep drama and personalproblems but it failed to flow. Just plodded along from thing to thinguntil the big climax ending. The ending was fine, but I have zerodesire to ever watch this again, and won't be buying the disc, and WILLbe watching the original again to re-feel everything that was missinghere. And it is almost too deep for kids. Lots of talk about life andretiring from it, and not lots of kid style hijinks.It looked great and had a story, but felt like a cash grab --- or thatall the original PIXAR writers were not involved.
