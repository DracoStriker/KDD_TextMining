Cars 3 is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and agreat voice cast. It certainly has its moments, a pleasure as always tosee these lovable characters once again, particularly Lightning McQueenand Mater, who have a terrific back and forth with one another asalways. There is also a very sweet, hard hitting message as we seeMcQueen accepting his fate and realising it is his time to pass on thetorch, the final fifteen minutes certainly serves as an effectivefinale to the series. I am somewhat heartbroken to be rating a Pixar film below an eight, butthe quality of this film is far less than what I have come to expectfrom this studio. It is a very slow moving ninety minutes that I wouldimagine would get quite tedious for kids. It tries too hard to remaingrounded, but is not gritty enough for that to be effective, it is fartoo innocent. It is also rarely funny, I am not saying this in a way that the jokesfall flat, but it actually does not try to be humorous for very longperiods. It has a droll, bland tone throughout, an annoying newcharacter and a very small amount of screen time from all thecharacters who made the original two harmless fun, bar Lightning. Expected much more from my favourite animation studio. A disappointingconclusion to an enjoyable series, Cars 3 is nothing more than a moviemade for merchandising, the kids may love it, but there is very littlehere for adults. Lightning McQueen struggles to keep up with a new generation of racersand technology.
