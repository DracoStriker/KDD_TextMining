*** This movie is both politically correct and sexist. This is commonwith most movies today ***This movie really lost its way. What made the first movie so great wasthe heart between Sally, McQueen and Mater and the absence of politicalcorrectness and sexism. That was sadly an issue in this movie. BothSally and Mater dialled in their performances through lame scripts, amajor let down. Chick Hicks was extremely weak, although his colleaguein nastiness (Certain) played the part well. Thankfully, McQueen wassolidly played by Owen Wilson. Without him, there would be no heart tothis movie. While Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzon) had some heart, herrole as the "victim" was borderline insulting and has become a clichéad nauseam. She would have been much better marginalised in the sameway McQueen was in the first movie (ie. not the "McQueen wasmarginalised because he was a woman" tripe that's become so popular inthe modern age of victimhood). Pixar just can't get past this sexism.It's impacted their last 1/2 dozen movies. Enough already Pixar.Ultimately, the movie didn't work well because of lacklustrecharacters, the lack of chemistry between the characters (especiallySally and McQueen) and the usual cliché in most movies today (women areall victims). If you are tired of political correctness, give this onea miss. Go and watch The BFG on DVD. Despite having a strong femalelead, that movie skipped the political correctness without missing abeat. It can be done Pixar, it can be done. Pixar have just lost theirway.
