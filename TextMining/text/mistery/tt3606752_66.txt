I hate to hate on this movie I really do, but it just misses in so manyplaces. I'll only mention a few. This review will have spoilers!Lightning McQueen was an awesome confident character , now he's only ashell of himself. it's not even the same character anymore. It makes itout to be a good thing - and he is nicer, but evidently that means youcan't be competitive and you must give up... Also, I'm kinda tired ofevery Disney movie feeling the need to push feminist propaganda - andif you miss this in the movie - well, tell me your trick - I'd love toknow how you do it. And finally BIG SPOILER HERE: the ending iscompletely stupid - he doesn't even finish the race - he stops midwaythrough and lets the young female protégé finish for him - yes youknow, the one who was always told she couldn't do it and that shewasn't allowed in the race - Blah...blah...blah.... IN THE MIDDLE OFTHE STINKIN RACE! This is a movie for kids that decided to tackle theissues of ageing and sexism.... I just want to take my kids to a moviethat is for kids.
