The first Cars movie is a classic that will be enjoyed for a long timeto come. Cars 3 a has a few major problems. - We don't want to live inor know about whatever 'new reality' this movie has created, whereLightning isn't the fastest car anymore. We especially don't want toknow that there is an entire new generation of cars that are fasterthan him. How depressing is that. - The movie has very little of theheart, soul, and humor of the original. It has a very different feel,with the 'next gen' cars speaking and acting like spoilt millennials.Jackson Storm is a nasty piece of work. - If feels like the point ofthe movie is to reinforce that 'girls can do anything' (like mostmovies these days). That's all well and good, but it's not what we paidmoney to actually go and see. We want to watch a movie about themovie's actual hero and main character, Lightning Mcqueen. And we wantto see him win and NOT be depressed, old and slow most of the time.
