I'm not a huge fan of the Cars franchises, even though I might one ofits soul defenders because I actually really enjoyed the first carsmovie which I thought had a good message of slowing down and enjoyinglife, not just speeding by missing out on what life has to offer. Cars2 however was probably the worst Pixar movie ever made, so I was nonetoo pleased when I heard they were making a Cars 3. It all changed whenwe all saw the teaser trailer however (which was very dark) and I foundout that they have a new writing team and producer for this one. So Iwas open-minded when I walked into Cars 3, hoping for something good. Ihave to be honest, I really liked it a lot. It's a Cars film with Pixarlevel story telling which is something we have not seen in any of theCars films so far, including the first one. As much as I liked thefirst one though, it does lack a bit on Pixar level story telling. WhatI mean by this is that the movie (Cars 3) had some emotional moments,characters who are supposed to be there for the fun of it didn'toutstay their welcome, and the movie was generally fun and pleasing. Isay give Cars 3 a watch for enjoyment and amusement.
