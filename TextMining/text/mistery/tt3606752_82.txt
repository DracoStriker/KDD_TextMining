This movie was absolutely amazing it showed that Lightning Mcqueen hasgotten really old and is now in his later years and actually is showinghow much of a lesser racer he is now to all the new competitors andespecially the biggest one and the way they show Lighting Mcqueencoming through to train through his old age and to be a great raceragain is amazing and also meeting his friend that is his trainer andbecomes his friend and the way she comes out in this movie is amazing Ilove the way it showed her and his relationship its like a teacher to astudent or a mentor for him its amazing and the ending wow I did notexpect that at all I thought it would be like every other Cars moviebut it wasn't it actually captured what happened with Lighting Mcqueensmentor except with a little difference but it is amazing what happensat the end and even after the ending it shows how you can have twothings instead of one and that's amazing they just make this an amazingmovie but I wouldn't say its the best cause it's not fully a LightingMcqueen movie if you see the ending then you know what I mean but thisis definitely my second favorite out of the serious and Cars 1 is my #1because mostly you can never beat the #1 but this movie was fantasticthough and a great finish to the series hopefully not the end of it butit was a great movie for that if it was the finish. But that's how Ifelt about it worth every cent I paid.
