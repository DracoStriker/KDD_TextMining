"Cars 3" returns to its roots, and expands on its world without jumpingthe shark. The story and its beats are predictable, but it's thecharacter focused parts of the film that keep it interesting since mostof the film spends too much time referencing the first, as well asflashing back to moments that happened minutes ago, and it getsrepetitive. The first half was the roughest to get into since it rushesexposition in order to get to Lightning's crash scene, which ends upnot being that big of a deal anyways so it just makes the film longerthan it had to be. What saves the film though was the 2nd half, wherewe finally get to slow down, and take in the story. If you enjoyed thefirst film, you'll find some comfort here. It's still one of the weakerPIXAR films to date, but it's not bad either as it eventually providessome new ideas to make it worth your time, and I appreciated it forbeing practical.
