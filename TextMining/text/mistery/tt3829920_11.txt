"If this isn't the greatest job in the world, I don't know what is!"Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin) True to its title, Only the Brave depicts with authentic-seemingimitation, the hell of fire encountered in numerous fire fights, themost famous being the 2013 Yarnell Hill fire in which 19 firefightersdied. When Director Joseph Kosinski, an expert in action filming,dramatizes the rigorous routine of the fighters, with the help offirst-rate CGI, you seem to be right there in the midst of the flames.Like many films about war, this docudrama takes pains to reveal thedomestic tensions with wives waiting for fighters or to become pregnantor to take care of the children. All of this is to say, one couldbecome impatient with the non-essential melodrama as the real interestis in the mechanics of fighting.Of course, some domestic story is necessary to humanize the heroicfirefighters. However, this film seems to take too much time fleshingout the details of loves and family that take second place to thefires. It's the Granite Mountain Hot Shots, from Prescott, Arizona, whoare the stars as they fight heroically without complaint.Given the current fires raging in California, Only the Brave is timelyif nothing else. It will help put into perspective the danger and valorof the firefighters; it will also dwell unnecessarily on the nonfirefighting.All but one of the Granite Mountain Hot Shots do not come home from theYarnell fire. We are better able because of this film to appreciate thedanger of their jobs and the longing of their families. If you want anup close look at how these heroes fight fires, this is the film foryou. Certifiable heroes they are."I can think of no more stirring symbol of man's humanity to man than afire engine." Kurt Vonnegut
