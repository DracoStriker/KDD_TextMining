Very touching story. These people are real heroes. They are brave notonly on fighting fires but also fighting drugs. It's amazing thatBrendon picked up his life. That is responsibility! That is MAN! Keepup Brendon! I really appreciate that director Joseph have giveneveryone a chance to know those heroes.
