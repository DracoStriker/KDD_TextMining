I don't usually think about firefighters or the other service peoplewho are tasked with keeping us safe. This movie brought them into mylife and into my heart. It is unsentimental, almost unreal, almostdocumentary. I hadn't read anything about the story and so I had noidea where they were going with it so I allowed myself to becomecompletely engaged with the characters, with their lives.I suggest you watch it without reading anything...Let yourself hear thestory in beautiful fashion how it unfolded. Respect and learn
