Having fought wild land fires in Bastrop, TX and being in similarsituations as this movie depicted, it was definitely personallyemotional. I laughed, I cried, but at the end I but walked out speechless... Thelast 45 minutes of this film had me on the edge of my seat. The way allthe characters have a special personal touch to them makes this filmall more special! I wont spoil the movie, but bring a tissue box, theending had me in all the feels!
