This movie is based on true stories and true people. The events thatthe movie based on aren't well know but still worth being experienced.The movie followed a team of firefighters throughout years of trainingand fighting. Even though the story is spanned a couple of years, yetit still stayed dynamic and doesn't felt staled. The movie alsosuccessful in creating a strong ending by building up emotionalinvestment and raised stake for the final conflict.Unfortunately that the movie isn't without fault. I felt like most ofobstacles felt as if they were solved too easily. The movie also failedto explain technical details and make viewers understand what the teamwere doing during each firefighting.
