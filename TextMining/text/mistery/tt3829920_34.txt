I just wrote 5 paragraphs about how great and new Joseph Kosinski isthat I had to delete it because I realized this review was more about apost of his greatness than anything about the film.This is an all around great flick. I can't say enough good things aboutit. I loved the way the story was told, the writing, thecinematography, the score, the acting.. It is a good judge of a movie when it moves you in this wayemotionally. My first thought after the movie was, I need to go seethis Juniper(you'll know what that means after you see it)Joseph, I'm a 33 year old father and wanna be filmmaker at the peak ofmy wanna be, and you just made me wanna be a hot shot more thananything.Go see this movie tonight.
