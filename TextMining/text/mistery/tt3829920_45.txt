" . . . but I 'Spose some people still will insist upon feeling sadabout so many Crispy Critters," D.J. Trump said after a recent advancescreening of ONLY THE BRAVE in our Oval Office. "However, I preferfirefighters who don't let themselves get burned up; they're cheaper onmy budget," D.J. concluded. One might guess that Trump himself producedthis demeaning trivialization of America's Heroic First Responders, butthe movie credits claim that this hatchet job was sharpened by Japan'sSony Company. Maybe the Japanese toss around terms such as"Post-Coital" during their Locker Room Small Talk. Maybe the Japanesewould get a hoot out of one of THEIR Native People believing that thePresidents on Mount Rushmore were "carved out by the wind and therain," as they say that "Cheyenne" does during ONLY THE BRAVE. Maybethe Japanese F.D. wives would say lame things such as "It's not easysharing your man with a fire." But none of this hokum rings True in ourU.S. of A. Homeland. Nor does the notion that a junkie named "Donut"would be allowed to direct his 19 buddies into the Flames of CertainDeath. Please join the Outraged Patriot Trustees in their boycottagainst Sony's Trump-like War on American Values Today!
