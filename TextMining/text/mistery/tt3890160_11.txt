Everything about the film is pretty much pitch perfect if you ask me.Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furiousfilms, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that seriesif a certain reality of the moves matters to you. This is more in linewith Bullit,French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far asgreat chases.The music, fun, simply fun. Songs from every decade of my lifetime. Action best pure adrenaline action in years. You will be truly on theedge of your seat during much of the film.Humor, what can I say, love Edgar Wright's humor and this is his best.And oh what a cast! Loved every one of the leads performances. I thinkAnsel was a standout, but come on Jamie Foxx, Spacey, Hamm and thebeautiful Lily James. And the other leading lady, Eiza Gonzalez, wasunknown to me, but she was great with one terrific diner speech inparticular. I was lucky enough to see this at an early screening inDenver. I will be seeing this in the theaters once again when it opens,and I very rarely watch movies more than once.Sometimes when I see a review fawning over a film like this, I thinktroll. Best way to check that out is see how many films the reviewerhas reviewed and rated. I have over 4,000 rated films here. Not a lotof tens either.Best film so far this year.
