I think this film only made it to cinemas cause it has managed toinvolve household names such as Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx (why thesegreat actors ever said yes to this project heaven knows). It is athoroughly empty and soul-less attempt to be a stylish new thing, butfalls to the ground with a thud. Nikolas Winding Refn's film Drive hasalready done everything that Baby Driver tries to do. Where Drivesucceeded in telling a mysterious, deep story involving romance andaction at the same time as having a unique auteur style, Baby Driverfalls short in every respect. There is nothing wrong with the cast assuch, Im sure the actors do their very best with a thin plot and aneven thinner dialogue. Why this film has received such high rating onIMDb is a mystery to me.
