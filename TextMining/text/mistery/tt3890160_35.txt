I hate to be the guy who gives 5/10 stars to everything that looks nicebut lacks in substance, but it would be tough to rate it any better orany worse, so I'm truly stuck in the middle.I can certainly see why this movie has received praise from theaudience it's meant for, but as some other reviews here have remarked,it's kind of a boring affair overall.I can't deny the soundtrack, though, which is more enjoyable to me thanthe way Guardians of the Galaxy pt 2 seems to force its soundtrack inour faces. The way the music is used is impressive and fits naturallywith events on screen, regardless of many of those events not beingengaging enough to keep me from daydreaming about my personal lifewhile the film plays on before me. The music hitting at the right timewas really the only thing ripping me out of my own thoughts and backinto the narrative.Those who are excited by car chases, sunglasses, trendy styles & simpledialogue need apply. If you aren't into that stuff, then maybe themusic will save you too.5/10; will expect multiple sequels.
