... give me flashbacks to DIRTY DANCING.1. You can't force "clever." Something is either clever or it is not.This film is ambitious but not clever. If you want clever, done right,watch Lucky Number Sleven.2. The romantic arc is weird, too convenient, not well developed andthere is no chemistry.3. To borrow a line from Kevin Spacey's dialog, you want the good news?The good news is that the romantic arc is not an issue because thisfilm a much bigger issue. No audience connection. By the 60 minuteminute I did not care about Baby, or his instant girlfriend, or Spacey,of anyone. OK, I actually did care about the little kid who played thenephew. He should have starred.4. For those who care about dramatic structure, Fox's character is sotop-heavy that he should be counter-point. But to who? Baby is solightweight for most the movie that he cannot be counterpoint to Foxand Spacey at the same time.Over-rated to a scary degree. No wonder no two people can agree onanything anymore.
