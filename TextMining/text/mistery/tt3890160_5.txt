Just saw this in cinema. It seems to have been written with a teenageaudience in mind that doesn't ask any questions, or has demands likestory or character development or narrative flow and just buys themovie as is. IMDb rating of 8.6 at the time of writing this here...how...?My gripe with this one. The love story overall felt flat andemotionless and awkwardly cheesy with matching dialogue. The shotsfired in the shooting scenes were actually synchronised with thesoundtrack playing, with that giving the movie a corny / cheesyfeeling. Awkward and clichéd one liners, acting from teeny main leadswasn't believable at times. Car scenes were OK, hence 2 stars, theending was drawn out, felt rushed and discombobulated. I didn't reallycare for any of the characters tbh, apart from Jamie Fox. Overall this movie felt like watching a teenagers room. Everything wasthere just unorganised, messy and one doesn't quite know what to makeof it... Wouldn't recommend to watch it in cinema, wait for Netflix release orDVD. One time watch and quite forgettable, sadly.
