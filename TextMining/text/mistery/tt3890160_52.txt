"Baby Driver" is a sort of "Drive" wannabe with the story of anintriguing runaway driver However the messy genre of action, romance,crime, music, drama and comedy associated to an awfully moralistconclusion spoil what could have been a cult-movie. The music score issensational; Ansel Elgort and Lily James show great chemistry andperform charismatic characters. But the unfortunately story is not goodand the characters are confused and not well developed, especially Doc.In the hands of Quentin Quarentino, this storyline could have beengreat with better screenplay and direction. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Em Ritmo de Fuga" ("In The Rhythm of the Runaway")
