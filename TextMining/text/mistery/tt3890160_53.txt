I watched this movie at the theater with my friends, and I was amazedhow boring this movie was. The best part of the movie was the drivingscene at the beginning but once it's over the movie is like gum withoutany flavor.The music - the songs were good but were an awful choice for this kindof movies, the 60's-70's had better songs better hits, with smartchoice of songs this movie could have been a lot nicer to watch.Story - plot holes some parts made no sense what so ever.The cast - the cast was good and perform well.Overall this movie was awful, we expected more action but at the end wegot bad love story.
