This is one of the best movies so far in 2017. With a super mix ofcharismatic characters, catchy music a lot of humor this film is a surefire winner. A genius get-a-way driver with problems and issues findshimself in a spiraling tangle of events. The opening car chase followedby a musical coffee dance is worth the price of the ticket alone! Allthe players in this film are likable for different reasons and thewhole production is masterfully done:8/10.
