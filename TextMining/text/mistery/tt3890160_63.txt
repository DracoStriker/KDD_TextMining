Love, love, loved this movie!M saw it 4 times already and about to seeit again. Finally a feel good joy ride of a movie, if you fall asleepduring this movie, something is wrong with you, the acting, the music,the direction, the action and the cinematography is top notch in thismovie. Ansel Elgort is an amazing actor who now has a fan for life andEdgar Wright is a genius. I even loved how there was a deaf actor whowas great by the way, his name is CJ Jones and Lanny Joon was reallyfunny as JD even though the character was quick he was awesome. Themovie had 3 heist sequences and each one was better than the next andI'm telling you I was literally on the edge of my seat the first twotimes seeing the movie, I was able to sit back and really enjoy it thelast two times. This movie needs to win every award there is because itis that good. Please do not listen to the sour pusses with theirnegative reviews, this movie is genius, please do yourself a favor andgo see Baby Driver, and on the big screen too, don't wait for this tobe on DVD.
