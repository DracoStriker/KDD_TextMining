Movie is full of catchy phrases, nice shots and some good acting but itis still raw and unfinished as a steak with blood on a plate, it ispartly seasoned, haven't even touched damn pan... so I would say afirst shot a bit clumsy but with possibly better then average plot linethis childish teenager like rad movie can go to look-a-like boringnever ending series like fast and furious or step up franchise.
