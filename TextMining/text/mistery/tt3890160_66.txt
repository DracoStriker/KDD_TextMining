This is a really amazingly original movie: it's surprising actually, atfirst glance you'd think this must just be a good movie that made it tothe cinemas - but it's more than a good movie! It brings and originalstory based plot with a new concept to it, in my opinion using fast andfurious' concept and putting it with a good old-fashioned plot of a boywho's hurt in some form or way and living life on the edge but keepsloved ones safe. But it comes close to an end, like a classics moviebut putting the new base to it which works really well! And it suitsthe movie with its pace and way around the situation. Throughout themovie certain actions, he takes, comes back to do something for himlater on. In the end, this movie is really good bring classics to newand mixing it to make the best out of it! From what I hear there areplans for a second movie - which will be met with open arms and smilesfrom me and much more!
