I liked about 76% of this movie - until right after the awesome cameoby the incomparable Swan himself. The film gets to that point atbreakneck speed. Then it just sputters through moments like Wrightdidn't know how to finish things through at the same pace.Oh, and Jamie Foxx is intolerable beyond imagination. I know he wasmeant to be villainous. But it went from being apt characterization tocinematic teeth-grinding smugness without a trace of even devilishnuance. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the portrayal; itis straight-up grating, one-dimensional and detrimental in everyapplicable scene.
