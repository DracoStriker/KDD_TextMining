Edgar Wright remains one of my all-time favourite directors. Why?Because each and every film he crafts reeks of originality, he takes afew similar traits, throws them together, delves down a completelyunexpected route and forms something unique, something masterful. From'Shaun of the Dead' to 'Hot Fuzz' and so on and so forth, each filmfeels like something you think you've witnessed before, but on a wholenew level, something fresh, something alluring, packed withadrenaline... and of course, 'Baby Driver' followed suit.'Baby Driver' is an utterly engrossing caper-comedy that is (in mypersonal opinion) the finest film to face 2017 so far, I couldn't helpbut smile throughout, from the stunningly executed action scenes andstunts, through to the soundtrack (with an abundance of classic rockand soul tracks) and finally the heavily relatable characters. The lackof disappointment in Edgar Wright's work continues with this masterfulfilm, which is ultimately also one of the coolest films of the pastdecade or so.Many of the heist films of recent years have been rather disappointingwhen it comes to both story and technical achievement, however whensomething like 'Baby Driver' makes an appearance, it's refreshing toknow that indie films are still taking this planet by storm andshunting the blockbusters out of the limelight. To know that certainproduction companies still trust the creativity of a director over themonetary expectations, and by doing so, unleashing a flurry offantastic independently "driven" films.I'm gonna finish with this (partially odd) statement / testimonial...when I went to sleep last night, I had odd dreams of car chases andstunt driving to rock classics, and that is thanks to this film, thefact that it stuck with me even when I wasn't fully conscious. That'show much of a damn cool film 'Baby Driver' is... just go watch it, justthrow away your tickets to 'Transformers' and 'The Mummy' etc, and gosee this instead.
