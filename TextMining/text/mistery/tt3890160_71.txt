Edgar Wright does it again with one of the best movies of the year thusfar, Baby Driver, which concerns a getaway driver named Baby(AnselElgort) who is trying to get out of his life of crime working for acrime boss named Doc(Kevin Spacey) so he can move on with a girl thathe meets at a diner named Debora(Lily James). The problem is therealways seems to be 'one last job' and when the last one goes horriblywrong Baby has to rely on his skills to get out unscathed with Debora.The cast in this movie is stellar with the likes of Kevin Spacey asDoc, Jamie Foxx as Batts, Jon Hamm as Buddy, Eiza Gonzalez as Darling,Lily James as Debora and of course Ansel Elgort as Baby who all givefine performances. The script and direction are signature Edgar Wrightwith witty dialogue and fast paced, exhilarating action sequences.The car chase scenes really put you in the front seat and are set to a'killer' soundtrack which features many great classic songs. The wayWright uses music in this film is unprecedented in that nearly everyscene is set to the beat or flow of the soundtrack and it fitsperfectly. There's only a small handful of scenes where there isn't anymusic and those are when Baby himself is not listening to music as weessentially hear exactly what he hears throughout the whole movie. AsWright himself put it, he wanted the audience to be both 'Baby's eyesand ears' and he succeeded wildly in doing that.To wrap up, Baby Driver is one of if not the best movie of the year sofar and will likely feature in a lot of people's top 10 of the yearlists. It's also Edgar Wright's best movie since Hot Fuzz.
