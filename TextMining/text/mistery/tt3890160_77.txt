I saw this movie yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. I justwant to see it again and again. Everything about it was simply perfect. So detailed and rhythmic and onpoint everywhere. Probably the coolest movie I have ever seen. It is soamazing how director Edgar Wright uses music to drive the movie, itadds so much rhythm and groove to the scenes which makes it sointeresting and cool and synchronized at every point. I have never seena movie like this before. It's action packed with fantasticallycoordinated stunts and car chases. The plot is very entertaining andthe characters are interesting and funny. Great acting, especially fromJamie Foxx who does a fantastic job. Ansel Elgort is also a great leadand plays his role very well. Even if you don't like action movies,this movie won't bore you for one second. It is brilliant in every wayand so unique and amazing. It's very rare to see movies like thisnowadays. Cinema of it's finest kind. This is why I love movies.
