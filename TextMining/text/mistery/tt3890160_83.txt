Refreshing new acting/actors and story line.Edge of your seat entertainment.Jamie Fox was a good pick.Most importantly, the future of the Movie business is now blessed withLily James and Eiza González and Ansel Elgort. OMG, such great talent.We are now entering a New Generation of female and male talent in theBiz.Thank goodness because I am tired of seeing old Hollywood shoving filmsdown our throats, and then, having to hear Old Hollywood take Politicalstances-Geeeeeesh.The only downside is an old actor named Kevin Spacey, although, he gavea great performance, I would have appreciated a "New" talent taking hisplace.
