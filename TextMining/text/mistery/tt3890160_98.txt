Whatever your taste in movies you're going to love this one, KevinSpacy is a performance beast and he did -as usual- a perfect job. ifyou love cars, driving, drifting, etc. ... this is a perfect movie foryou. If you're looking for a heist movie, no, not this one, the movieis of the light kind, the heists inside are of the obsolete type thatwon't saturate you. The movie is great, won't be a waste of time ...trust me on that.
