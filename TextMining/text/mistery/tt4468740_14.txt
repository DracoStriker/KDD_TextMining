I was an unexpected fan of the first Paddington movie, walked into itexpecting not to enjoy it, but I was proved wrong. When I heard that asequel was coming, I just hoped it would retain the magic of the firstand it did, with a cherry on top! This movie invoked the inner childwithin me and was just a perfect viewing experience for this time ofthe year.The casting was genius, featuring many well known British actors, inroles big and small. It was like a gathering of all the best ofBritish, all having the best of time together. A huge hats off to HughGrant, pure brilliance!The imagination that went into this movie and the skill that managed toput this across to the audience was second to none! You will findyourself being absorbed into this world and will not want to leave.I've read some people complaining that this isn't what London is liketoday, but this is exactly how London was in my childhood mind, wherefantasy and reality met. Don't let go of your imagination, suspendreality and just enjoy.I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. You will laugh and youwill cry. Go see it, on your own, with your partner or with you family,you won't be disappointed.
