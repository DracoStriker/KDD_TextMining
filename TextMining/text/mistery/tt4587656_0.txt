One of the best animated films I have seen lately. The idea of theChristmas Story seen through the eyes of the animals was totally a newangle on the story and a wonderful inspiration for children and adults.Although there is obvious evidence of artistic right in the story, (hasto be with talking animals) it does follow along with the heart andwritten encounters of Baby Jesus family journey to His birth inBethlehem.I will be going this week for second viewing and checking with friendsand family about borrowing some children to take with me. I want everychild I know to see this.As soon as it becomes available on DVD my order will be placed. I have4 groups of children I will be encouraging to have their parents takethem to see this. Movie night at my house will have several showings ofthis movie.
