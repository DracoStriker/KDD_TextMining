This movie somehow manages to take one of the most important storiesfrom history, perhaps THE most important, and trivialize it throughlow-brow jokes, ridiculously distracting cameos and no-duh epiphanies.It has no further insights into the story of the birth of Christ,instead it mistakes gimmicks and laughless gags as a reason to createthe movie. It doesn't even suffice as a kids movie, and in fact may beeven worse at doing that then it is for adults.
