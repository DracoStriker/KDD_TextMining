We took our 5 year old and 3 year old to see it today. It was great!They loved it. It kept their attention the whole time. They got thehumorous parts and it told a pretty solid Biblical Christmas Story. Itwasn't too cheesy for us adults either. Although our family doescelebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmas, I think children of allfaiths can enjoy this movie. It's not too preachy nor does it push any"religious agenda."
