Firstly let me say, you know what you going in to see so don't expectany Oscar performances but still decent enough sequel, although I thinkthey must have decided to play it safe and toned down the violence andswearing that made it's predecessor successful. The cast knew what they were doing and appeared to play everythingtongue in cheek, rather than take it too seriously by the looks ofthings, which probably made it more enjoyable to watch. A few laugh out loud moments, especially from, surprisingly, EltonJohn's kick-arse scene and a scene involving a heart racing snow liftescape, agents in distress and an elderly gentleman's bowel movement!My main plus was Julianne Moore, she probably was surprise package ofthe movie, for me her role as the protagonist was perfect, not as overthe top as Samuel L Jackson, more understated and less in your face,which for me worked better. Shame her death was a bit anti-climatic.Story itself was by the numbers and there were a couple of plot holesand ending predictable but if you switch off your brain and just enjoythe movie for what it is, then it's worth watching.Will be nice to if we get to see more of The Statesmen if they decideto make another film (which is more than likely) hope Matthew Vaughanwould behind the scenes again if they do and possibly improve some thissequel flaws.Manners.. maketh... man
