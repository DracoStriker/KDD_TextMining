Kingsman: The Golden Circle is the sequel to the 2015 film Kingsman:The Secret Service. Once again directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass,X-Men First Class), it is a solid sequel that contains just as muchenjoyment and humour as its predecessor.One year after the events of the first film, the Kingsman's spyheadquarters is fatally attacked by an unknown entity. With most of theorganisation now dead, the surviving agents Eggsy (Taron Egerton) andhis trainer Merlin (Mark Strong) travel abroad to team up withStatesman, their American counterparts, in an effort to bring thismysterious new enemy to justice and save the world once again.Featuring the same ridiculously over-the-top action and unique Britishcharm, Kingsman: The Golden Circle is a worthy follow-up to the 2015film. Matthew Vaughn's slick, fast- paced direction showcases histalent for cleverly choreographed fight scenes and quirky comic relief,which few other directors would be able to replicate successfully. I amhopeful that he returns to direct the third installment. However,similar to Guardians of The Galaxy Vol.2, the film does lack some ofthe freshness and surprise that was in the original, plus its runtimeof 141 minutes does make it drag at times. The cast of characters, bothnew and old, lend themselves to some highly entertaining situations,including a hilarious performance from Elton John playing afictionalised version of himself. The real stand-out, though, wasJulianne Moore as the film's villain. It's so rare to see her play suchan evil character so effectively and so much fun to watch, consideringher reputation for usually playing likable roles.I rate it 8/10
