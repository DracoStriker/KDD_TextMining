Dear readers, now I want to review the sequel of Kingsman. The chapterone of this movie is amazing, as well as this chapter two. Thedifferences are the actors, the actions, and the plots. At the sequel,there are at least three great actors being played: Julianne Moore,Hally Barry, and wowwww, Elton John, ladies and gentleman, Elton John!!Based on my feeling, the budget of filming these sequel movie is reallyexpensive because Elton John appears not just once as cameo, but fewtimes, even he is part of solution of the plots. Big applause forElton, yeah love you!! The actions in this sequel are quiteunpredictable, we never know what happens, who kills, who is beingkilled, who betrays, and who is being betrayed. Everything uncoversuntil the end of the plot, so don't worry you can still enjoy all theactions in the movie with popcorn on your hands, without beingconfused. There are also new machines, new technologies, and new gunsthat are more modern and more impressive that make you want to be aKingsman in your real life. The equipment is so cool, like thosepresented on the Spy Museum in Berlin. Some surprises will come, butyou will know what the "Golden Circle" means. Then, last but not theleast that I want to review, is the plots. While in the chapter one,Kingsman is trying to change an ordinary bullied boy to be a handsomegentleman of Kingsman team and everything seems right after, thesesequel offers the problems from the beginning until the end andeverything seems complicated. Some critics will say that the plot isquite ordinary, about the hero and the villain, but more than that,Kingsman: Golden Circle is about honesty, loyalty, and intelligencebetween the state, intelligence team, and boy/girlfriends. This is arecommended movie to be watched with the one you love and how you makeit proportional between all of those factors, because manners makethman, and this time is with Elton John :)
