This film is just about the bottom of the barrel. Dumb script,uniformly bad acting, blaring music and ridiculous special effects donot a good movie make. If it were any worse it would be a spoof, but itisn't a spoof, it's trying to be real. What's more amazing is that suchgood actors would do such a poor film, without even a wink in theireye.
