I was bored after the first minute. Stupid plot with weak characters.The main actor is totally uncharismatic which just makes every 'f' wordsound even more pointless and unnecessary. Contains possibly the mostvulgar scenario I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I can'tbelieve that actors of that calibre would even star in such a load ofrubbish. I could go on but this movie has already wasted enough of mytime.
