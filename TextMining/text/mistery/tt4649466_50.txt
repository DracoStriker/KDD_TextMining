Cartoonish-type plot, totally silly. But we laughed throughout and wereentertained. Two words...ELTON JOHN! Hysterical to this 56 year oldlady and her 64 year old husband. Understandably millennials won'tshare the same heartfelt enjoyment in seeing Sir Elton John in thisrole. But he was great & he made us Laugh! We only wished he would'vebelted out one of his hits from the piano loft in the last scene. (oreven during the end credits) Julianne Moore was perfectly wonderful asthe villain, she never disappoints. In fact, most all the cast did agood job keeping the story moving along and with much comic relief!Halle Berry was the only disappointment as Ginger. I didn't see anyworth in her character or how she played it. I call this type of filmMindless Fun. In this regard, I think you will enjoy it.
