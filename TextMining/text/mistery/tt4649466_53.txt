After reading some critical reviews on IMDb I should have trusted mygut feeling. There are a few (three, possibly four) funny moments inthis movie, but overall I found watching this movie a boring, sometimeseven frustrating experience. The performance of Elton John is pathetic.Maybe he needed the money? Conclusion: stay away and spend your moneyelsewhere.
