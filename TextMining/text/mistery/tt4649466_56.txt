This is the action spy adventure sequel to 'The Secret Service'.There are plenty of over the top action sequences, but the plot ispoorly conceived. More time on developing the plot would have been wellinvested. The Kingsman headquarters is targeted and destroyed and mostof the Kingsman members are simultaneously targeted and killed off,except Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong). This film then introduces the USA counterparts 'The Statesmen'. Thedisaster takes them to the USA where they need to team up to defeat thevillain. The villain (Julianne Moore), saturates every popular drugwith a slowly acting deadly virus. Our hero's mission is to retrieve asample of the antidote. The best parts are the cameos from Elton John, in flamboyant costumes.These were truly brilliant. Having enjoyed the first Kingsman, Iwanting to like this, but this is not as fresh as the launch film,sequels are rarely as good. I ended up feeling disappointed. Essentially this is perfect for a 12 year old (or younger) audience.
