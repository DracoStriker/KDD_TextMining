This movie reminded me of the old bond movies. Cheesy villains andgadgets, women with theatrical make up, wall-to-wall yellow teeth andloud climatic music in wildly inappropriate situations. But Ithoroughly enjoyed its funny moments. Especially when they pointed outthe differences between Americans and the British. It had the bestfight sequences I have ever seen. I'm a big fan of cleverlychoreographed smooth fight sequences with impossibly fluid moves. Butthe highlight of the movie was clearly Elton John in his multicoloredchicken costume. He was just hilarious.
