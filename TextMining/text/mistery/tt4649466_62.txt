I loved the first one as it was fun and fresh and had the right touchof humour. However, this followup film feels really contrived and allof the attempts to contextualise the film to the first with characters,fight scenes and plot were just constant let-downs. The villains wereless quirky and threatening, and the unraveling plot was ratherpreposterous. Even the funniest concept of a kidnapping of a superstarcouldn't save the film, although it had its moments of hilarity.More to the point, the detail of the film was annoying, like everythingseemed to fit together like someone had written it, which of coursethey have, but it's just all a little too contrived to enjoy. I neverfelt lost in this film at all.
