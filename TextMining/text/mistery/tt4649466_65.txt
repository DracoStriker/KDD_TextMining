Nothing but action from start to finish. So much action that it becameblah blah halfway through it. Will give it credit for entertainment,Star Power and music score. Went as a family on school night so familyreally enjoyed it. I missed having a relevant plot but my standardsprobably to high. Was hoping this would become the new James Bond-likeflicks but...Definitely expect more sequels so stand-by, sigh...
