What I thought of Kingsman: The Golden Circle The humor was predictableand cringe worthy, the plot minus well be nonexistent, they barelydevelop/use the villain. All the characters that were cool in the firstmovie were given nothing to do. And the new characters that they dointroduce are so irrelevant that they minus well not be there. There isonly one new character that is given anything to do, but he is soobviously a secondary villain waiting to be revealed that he shouldjust have been a secondary villain to begin with. There was also abunch of attempts at shock humour attempt, but those were just moreobnoxious than actually shocking. The action is also not really welldone, because there are times where you just can't really tell what'shappening. The movie keeps zooming in unnecessarily because I guess thedirector thought that looked cool. I basically hated almost everythingabout this movie, and what I didn't hate, I was completely indifferenttowards it
