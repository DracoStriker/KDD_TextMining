I went to watch this movie merely from trailer and thought would be anice one. After watching it, I kind of don't know which genre thismovie should be categorized in. The set feels like that of a cowboymovie, but there is Instagram, Twitter and drones carrying objects.When a villain can have lots of secret headquarters ready to dispatchcure, and since era of drones, it is modern day world and I don't seeneed for villain to hide in a secret jungle. There are sophisticatedrobots, but nothing sophisticated to monitor her compound - not even aCCTV camera facing outside the walls!!?? Some movies do not make sensebut they hold you in grip until the very end, this movie doesn't makesense too and in doing so you are bored and aware of the real lifewaiting outside.
