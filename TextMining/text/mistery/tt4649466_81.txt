On the high side, I am giving kingsman 2 a 5. I waited and waited forthis movie to come out. After watching movie after movie just epicallyfails this year, I was hoping for a little life here. Well, all of ourfavorite characters are back. Minus the villains. we find ourselveskicking it back with a giant bottle of whiskey, a gift from thestatesman. And now we have the brits working with the Americans. hassome really dry humor. SOme jokes are Raw while others just make nosense at all. The car scene in the 1st part of the movie just seems tobe really drawn out. Like it could have ended 30 sec into it. I dobelieve they are already in the writer's room with a next installment.I do hope they decide what type of movie they want to be ie horror,Syfy. and then go from there. This movie boomed at the box office andnow we know why!
