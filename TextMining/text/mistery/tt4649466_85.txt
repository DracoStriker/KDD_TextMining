Kingsman: The Golden Circle left a few story arcs to be desired.Firstly the movie relied heavily on CGI and more shorter fight sceneswould've been better just as the first movie had. The spectacle ofthose scenes in The Secret Service is what made the film what it is, agreat piece of an action spy movie.Secondly the death of Roxy was a surprise considering she is a goodcharacter and a capable Kingsman the same as if not more than Eggsy.Therefore, the fact that she was killed of at the beginning was verydisappointing to see. She should've been kept around for the wholemovie if not most of it with herself and Eggsy working together as ateam. This would have been a brilliant combination to see and would'veworked well on screen as we have not seen the character have a fightscene yet. Beginning her back now for the third installment would've bea cop out. Overall a poor decision to kill her offThe realization that Harry Hart was in fact still alive could easilyhave been left for the third installment as his involvement had littleeffect to the story. This is where Roxy could have taken his part. The roles of Agent Tequila and Ginger Ale played by Channing Tatum andHalle Berry respectively left a lot to be desired, merely extendedcameos. From the end her's hoping they have a much larger part in thenext movie and this was a mere setup.
