Kingsman: The Golden Circle begins with an action sequence ofstylization and quality of such proportions that it's paralleled onlyby two other scenes of a similar nature in the film. With thatconsidered, it's such an overwhelming disappointment that too much ofthe picture is inferior filler. The latest additions to Vaughn's spyuniverse, the members of alternative spy organisation Statesman,unfortunately succeed in continuing the disappointing trend. Theysimply lack character development, and so have the impression of beingaesthetics as opposed to fully fleshed out characters. Additionally,Istruggled to determine whether the disturbing, brutal acts performed byJuliane Moore's drug kingpin Poppy were examples of intelligent, darkcomedy or deprived shock value aiming at leaving a lasting impressionon the viewer. It's fortunate then that, despite not being delivered inan abundance, the film's signature stylized, graphic action sequences,accompanied by unconventional soundtrack decisions are so incrediblycompelling and enticing. Overall, The Golden Circle lacks consistencyand too frequently delivers underwhelming content, however in it'shighest quality moments it's enthralling.
