This movie was AWFUL and a complete waste of $30! Such adisappointment! I feel let down by the IMDb rating; I feel duped asmovies of this caliber are usually rated around a 4-5 star...not 7star. Do yourselves a favour and don't pay to see this movie. Streamfor free if you're really interested and I guarantee you won't lastmore than 10 mins. Or wait until you can rent it for $4 but even thenI'd see that as a complete waste of snack money.Honestly one of theworst movies I've seen in recent history, alongside Zoolander 2 and EyeIn The Sky.
