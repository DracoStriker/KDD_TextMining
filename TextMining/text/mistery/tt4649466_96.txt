Kingsman : The Golden Circle is receiving generally negative reviewsfrom critic averages (RT : 5/10, MC : 4.4/10). This is really terriblenews because this movie is pretty damn good. This movie really was justas good as the first for me.Matthew Vaughn, director of the first, comes back to direct the secondone and he really did a good job with this one. Like Wes Anderson,there's only one director in Hollywood who shoots his movies like this.MV shows off his style really well in his incredible action scenes.Kingsman 2's story is exactly like the first : completely outrageous.It is extremely insane and entertaining to watch. There's nothing quitelike it. This movie has a huge cast of well known actors : Taron Egerton, MarkStrong, Colin Firth, Pedro Pascal, Halle Berry, Jeff Bridges, JulianneMoore and Channing Tatum. Yes, it's exactly what you expected, there'snot enough of everyone and I would've liked to see more than two sceneswith Channing Tatum and Jeff Bridges. However, this really doesn'tmatter that much because who really shines is Taron Edgerton. He's agreat actor and I hope his career really takes off after these Kingsmanmovies and the highly underrated Eddie the Eagle. Mark Strong, ColinFirth and Pedro Pascal are also standouts.So overall, it's really sad to see another great movie sequel failbecause this one really was great and fun.
