I went to see Lady Bird with moderately high hopes after reading somereviews. I enjoyed it and it was well done but I found the story anddialog to not be original enough or clever enough to give it equallyhigh praise as some reviews have. It's good for a few chuckles but'best comedy of 2017' it is not, or at least I hope there is somethingfunnier.
