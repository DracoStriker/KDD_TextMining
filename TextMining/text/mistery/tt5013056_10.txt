I have never bothered to post a review before for any film. But I feelthat I must to point out the nonsense of film reviewers these days. Isee the critics post as must see, film of the year, et, etc. This wasbilled as a film with fantastic sound. I found the continuous droningnoise whose pitch increased during the film to what I hoped would be afantastic climax, but I the drone included what sounded like whalenoises and more boring droning noises with occasional sounds of gunfire. I was bored after 15 minutes, the ridiculous story of the kid inthe fishing boat, the original bit about the spitfire pilots and thenonsense of the soldiers taking cover in the boat.....absolute shallowlazy boring rubbish filming. If they added a decent music score it mayhave kept me interested. This film does not show it as it was its justabsolute cap and does not come across as a powerful film at all. Awaste of money.
