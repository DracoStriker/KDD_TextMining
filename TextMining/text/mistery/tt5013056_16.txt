What a Brilliant movie. We saw this on the night of the World Premiere,intense and packed full of fabulous acting... The camera shots wereabsolutely spot on, and you couldn't look away for a second withoutmissing a perfect scene. The entire score, coupled with the dialogueand videography made this film and I cannot wait to see it again.
