A very big letdown for such a moment in history. Recommend wait forHBO. Editing was terrible posting a foolish timeline that made nosense, midnight in France/daylight in England at the same time.Hundreds of small civilian boats assisted in the evacuation, not thedozens on the screen. Thousands of Brit Troops standing in linesexposed on the beach for evacuation with no ships in sight, waiting.Everything from an odd random torpedo scene to the rescued troopsgetting pulled into boats, soaking wet in oil/seawater then getting offin England wearing dry crisp uniforms.The best dramatic gimmick? A valiant RAF pilot flies over the beachheadtill he runs out of fuel, but he still has time gliding to shoot downone more Hun plane. That creates that final (5 minute) moment in thefilm where he quietly glides across the beach, providing that requisitefilm shot of all the British stars watching, biting their lips withrespect.Meanwhile, I am wondering why he is landing towards the German heldbeach? Then with all the emergencies on the plane (off course, landinggear won't come down) he continues to wear his high altitudebreathing/comms headset? The plane lands, the pilot jumps out andstands looking at the dunes and approaching Germans. Now being filmedwith the golden sunset lighting hue technique, we finally see theglowing pilot's face (IMO Tom Hardy, the best British Actor today)defiantly surrendering. You think they would have used real humanstories from the event to tell the story... instead we get scenescreated specifically for select stars who dropped by the set to spendthe day shooting their lines. A wasted opportunity to tell an amazingstory of how the civilian armada saved the day.
