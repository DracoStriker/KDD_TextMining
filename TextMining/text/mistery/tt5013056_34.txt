What a disappointment! The worst part was the tooth rattling and incessant background bassbeat that seemed only loosely related to the equally deafening andincessant score. More intrusive even then the ridiculous soundtrack inGravity during the destruction of the space station in airless space,the beat and the score in Dunkirk drowned out what limited dialogue andatmosphere was present in every scene of the movie, even trespassing abit on the hammy and over-extended scenes with Kenneth Branagh (no realloss there, I guess). When you can't hear the Merlin engine of aSpitfire from the cockpit, then you know there's a problem. Speaking of which, what can you say about Spitfire whose fuel andammunition lasted forever, and whose terminal glide seemed even longerthan that, and yet somehow apparently ended in the timely destructionof a Stuka mid-dive bombing?I cannot fathom the positive reviews this film received.It wasn't even that impressive as a spectacle. Where were the masses ofabandoned equipment and materiel? Some stacked crates right at thestart, and a single anti-aircraft gun? The opening scenes on the beachof Saving Private Ryan left an impression 100 times stronger than thisentire film.
