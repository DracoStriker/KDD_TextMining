Christopher Nolan is a visual genius: this film is just stunning tolook at. From the bullets flying near soldier's head to gorgeousexplosions, it transports you right into the war zone within the first10 minutes of the screening. Furthermore, it is an accurate descriptionof the "Miracle of Dunkirk". This is where the movie nails it. However,apart from that, I've had a couple of issues with it.The film is told from three perspectives: Air, Mole and Sea. This iswhere the movie falls a bit short. The editing at some points feelslazy and not very consistent: it cuts from a dramatic scene or intenseaction scene very quickly. The film is told in a non-linear way: this makes us watch certainscenes twice through different perspectives. Although this could'vebeen done in a very interesting way, it's very difficult to keep trackof whose perspective we're watching at times. Even when certainsemi-important (I'll get back to this later) soldiers die, it took me awhile to realise this happened.This is where my third and final problem come into question: thecharacters lack depth. You don't care about the main character, nor anyof the other soldiers that are dying. If I'm watching a film about war,I like to bond with the characters I'm seeing on screen. If none ofthem show any real emotion, the viewer won't as well.All in all, Dunkirk could've been amazing. I personally don'tunderstand why it has such a high rating besides being directed by avery well-known director / starring famous actors (including infamousHarry Styles) / being a war biography. Disappointing.
