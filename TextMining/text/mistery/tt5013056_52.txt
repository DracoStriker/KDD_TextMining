where to start ... WW2 ended over 70 years ago, so I thought it was thetime to tell true stories about what happened back then, but I guess Iwas wrong, and the allies still need some sort of ego- boosters, wherethe Germans are portrayed as dumb with fighters made of paper. Themovie is very boring and slow to be categorized under war genre, andyou can see that clearly even on the faces of the actors ... 400,000soldiers trapped on a beach, should be a movie scene that everyone willremember for years, yet all we saw were few bored soldiers standing inlines as if they were waiting for bathroom... the lines of people atmovie theaters who went to watch this movie looked more crowded andalive than the 400K !! And where are all those civilians boats whicheveryone was talking about? I thought it was gonna be a huge fleet, yetthey were no more than a dozen of them !!!! I am not gonna mention thebackground music as this was a disaster which needs a separate reviewby itself... save your time and maybe spend your money on buying anyWW2 game which will be 100 times more exciting than watching this
