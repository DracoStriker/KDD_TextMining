Bad. Saving Private Ryan, filmed 20 years ago, blows this out of thewater. Someone said there is no character development to make thisabout all men and women on the beach/boats - what all 100 of them orso? At no point was there an exploration as to the size of thedisaster, at no point do you feel any connection to any of the men orwomen. Of course every history buff like me will watch the film.Is it the next SPR - no,no,no. Will you want to watch it again. Nochance. Buy it on blue, no. Watch on Netflix, I'm sure there will besomething better when the time comes, like, well, anything you haven'talready seen.I was actually bored of the stale "dramatic" long scene shots of actorseither looking to the sky or looking to the ground. Its a very boringfilm in my opinion, but then I am a fan of SPR, BOB, The PAcific,Battle of Britain, Battle of the Buldge - you know, good films/series.
