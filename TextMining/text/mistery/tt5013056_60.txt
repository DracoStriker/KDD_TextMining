Mediocre movie...this director obviously does not understand humanemotions (inception...who was the "baddy"?)...this film seems like hehas read up on them...and then went overboard! Smaltzy..stupid in bits,it's like nothing so much as a 90s UK GUINNESS advert...I don't thinkyou had them in USA? "Good things come to those who wait"?...https://youtu.be/Y9znA_dwjHw The film was almost exactly like one ofthese adverts...right down to the scene at the end where the soldiersare handed beers....I almost expected that tagline to pop up! Soldierscommuting suicide at Dunkirk? Spitfire pilots allowing themselves torun out of fuel? Soldiers "hiding" in a boat? A naval commanderspending the whole film alone on a pier... Miles from anycommunications, was this a bad metaphor?? The music...maybe it was wellwritten, but it was overused to the point of irritation..."oh, I'msupposed to feel tense now? Thanks music!"
