The subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating true life tale of heroismand patriotism which should present the perfect canvas for a filmmaker.However, this film falls flat. Instead of a glorious landscape thatputs the audience into the battle itself, we are left with animpressionist piece in which the audience must provide their owndialogue, character depth, and epic size.As other reviewers have stated what did they spend $150 million on?Dunkirk essentially presents a couple thousand men standing on thebeach waiting for a ride, with a couple of planes flying around. Notexactly "Epic."If you walk into this film expecting Saving Private Ryan, you willsimply be bored and left unsatisfied as I was.
