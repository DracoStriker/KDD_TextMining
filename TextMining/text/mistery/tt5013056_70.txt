The movie was a huge disappointment.Here's some of the things that have been said about this movie - noneof them are true:"A technical masterpiece" "An absolutely outstanding depiction" "A mustSee" "Best movie Of summer 2017" "Best war film ever made" "A must seefilm" "Dunkirk is an authentic..." "Dunkirk is the most realisticwar-movie ever made"If I had the time, for my own personal viewing I would re-work thismovie by first re-ordering the overlapping and out of sequence scenes,and then kill the entire droning musical score (obviously it would haveto be on a track that I can turn off). Just these simple changes wouldmake it a far better watch. To fine tune the movie further, I wouldshorten the many long pointless pauses, when people in real life wouldeither do or say something.The evacuation from Dunkirk was of course a real event, a significantelement of which was the hundreds of small vessels and regular folk whotook to the sea to being their boys back home ? all of that hardly camethrough, nor did the true seriousness of the situation on the beachesand in the town, and the fighting that was going on in an attempt toslow the approaching army down.All in all, I think this movie is a p-poor-job. I wish I'd waited untilit was on Netflix - I could have at least been editing some of myphotos at the same time.Do I think you should watch this at the movie theatre: No!
