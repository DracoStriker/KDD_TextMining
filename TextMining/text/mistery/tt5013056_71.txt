Hard to understand the hype attached to this movie. As usual DirectorChristopher Nolan's penchant for the non-linear method of directionmakes the usual shambles of the story line. Given the promotion forthis movie I expected more and waited, unrewarded unfortunately, forthe seminal moment that would lift the movie above the average to theepic magnitude of the actual event. The movie lacked .... scale. Forexample the RAF lost well over 100 aircraft during the evacuation butNolon would have you believe only 3 RAF aircraft showed up. The Germansalso lost well over 100 aircraft, some say closer to 200+. Same withthe loss of equipment. Left on the beach at Dunkirk were enough weaponsand equipment to equip 8-10 Divisions, and included 800+ field guns,500 anti-aircraft guns, tanks, trucks etc etc None of that scale wasrepresented. In fact the long lines of troops waiting on the beach inthe opening scenes soon disappeared and the beaches were left empty inmany scenes long before the movie reached its peak. The Seminal Momentin the actual event was that some 700+ small boats left England to helprescue the stranded troops. Nolan managed a "fleet" of about 10 or 12.Again, no sense of scale. Many are claiming this is one of the best warfilms ever. I don't think so. I felt short changed to be honest becauseit lacked the scale of, for argument sake, the opening scenes fromSaving Private Ryan.
