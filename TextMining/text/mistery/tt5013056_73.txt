I've just come from seeing Dunkirk, and I would say that it would havebeen no colossal loss not seeing it. I nearly left on account of themusic several times. It was dragging, tense, and full of disharmonythroughout nearly the entire movie. If you've no seen it yet, I wouldsuggest that it's not worth the price of admission. There's my 2¢.
