The movie has so much potential in the first 10 minutes but then itfalls apart. While Nolan is trying to decide if the movie wants to beSaving Private Ryan or another Memento, he forgets to build anycharacters or narrative that anyone can care about. What a shame given the cast he had at his hand. He was just unable todirect them or bring together anything redeeming or with any level ofdepth. Aside from the first 10 minutes, there are some beautifulcinematography. However, the scenes are shot on different days. Onesunny and the other overcast. So the beautiful visuals are unable tosustain any type of mood across the length of the movie. At the end, it's clear the story was too ambitious for Nolan and he wasjust unable to put it together.
