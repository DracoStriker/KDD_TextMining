The movie is so slow. Watching the trailer you would expect actionscenes in the movie but there is almost none. Its all one side isattaching and the other is defending. You almost feel in the beginningthe director is setting up the movie nice for some nice action tofollow but midway through the movie you realize that nothing hashappened and apparently nothing is going to happen. The movie neverpicks up. It just fails.
