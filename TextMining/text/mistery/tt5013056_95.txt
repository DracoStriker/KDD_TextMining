I went to this movies with very high expectations and I was reallydisappointed. I am not sure what went wrong but I guess it was supposedto convey the magnitude of the events as well as tie the spectatoremotionally, sadly it failed miserably in both. The only one i felt forwas the french soldier, meanwhile all other actors were just bland andi couldn't care less for. Moreover the movie couldn't at all convey themagnitude of the event (only a word at the end of the Movie we save300,000) All i can say is that was painfully boring. The music wasannoying most of the time. It was just bad storytelling and I reallycant understand how can anybody like this.
