I saw this film at TIFF in Sept, and it is absolutely brilliant. It wonthe People's Choice awards at the festival, and that says a lot. Whatsays even more, is I am a huge fan of Martin McDonagh's work,especially his writing, but I never once before thought his films wouldbe nominated for best picture. I truly think that will happen thisyear.Please click the link to watch my video review, and I hope you enjoy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYKsLQSlhA
