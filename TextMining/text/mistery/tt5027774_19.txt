Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. When a film is so highlyspoken about it can mean one of two things: 1) It's going to be a greatfilm, or 2) the praise is being overstate. Unfortunately, "ThreeBillboards..." falls into the later category, as director/writer MartinMcDonagh ("Seven Psychopaths" 2012) presents an intriguing dark comedythat ultimately comes across as a variety of individual scenes puttogether to make a story. Featuring Frances McDormand ("Fargo"), WoodyHarrelson ("The Hunger Games"), Sam Rockwell ("The Way Way Back"), LucaHedges ("Manchester by the Sea"), Caleb Landrey ("Get Out"), ZeljkoIvanek ("Argo") and Peter Dinklage ("Game of Thrones"), the acting isnot the problem here. McDonagh's sets are stagy, his writing islackluster, he tends to add in scenes/character in order to oddly movethe story along, and the ending does nothing for the flow of the film.Standing out in this heavily star packed film is Caleb Landrey. Landreyis initially had to understand, due to an unexplainable accent,however, he over comes this weakness by graciously playing the victim."Three Billboards" is far from a clunker. I guess I just expected amore tightly woven and satisfying production.
