So I watched Three Billboards earlier today. I really may start buyingthis film's chances as a true contender for Best Picture after all.Considering the incredibly enthusiastic response it got from theaudience, it could very well be a consensus pic. For some reason Iassumed it would be a "harder" film to love, but not at all. In termsof performances, these actors have really rarely been better. FrancesMcDormand could probably do this role in her sleep, but that's atestament to her abilities and less about it not being great work. Farfrom it. This role is a culmination of the many types of roles she'splayed in the past, and she of course delivers it perfectly. There isabsolutely no other actress that I think would be able to give the workthat she does. The same goes for Sam Rockwell. None of what he doeshere is too shocking or "stand out" because, just like McDormand, he'san actor who has shown traits of this role in some of his works in thepast. Again, this is not a criticism but simply proof of what anaccomplished and capable actor he's proved himself to be in the past.If the Oscar should come down to him or Willem Dafoe, I think itabsolutely should be Rockwell's. Woody Harrelson and Caleb Landry Jonesalso deliver some strong, affecting work in their roles.
