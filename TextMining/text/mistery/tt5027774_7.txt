Outstanding work by writer/director Martin McDonagh, in a return toform after the off-kilter "Seven Psychopaths." This is a film about thejoint cul-de-sacs of loss and revenge. It is both horrifying andtouching, and it is also very funny.McDonagh, a first-rate playwright, knows how to structure scenes andwrite dialogue. To do him justice, first-rate actors are required. Theymust love the succulent stew of characters he cooks up, because hecatches the very best. I can't find enough superlatives for Frances McDormand and SamRockwell. They are, here as in everything they've ever been in, great.They are ably supported by Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, ClarkePeters, Sandy Martin, Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes, Amanda Warren. Theonly weak link in this superb ensemble is Abbie Cornish, who is warmand smiley but is unfortunately out of her depth: a very odd piece ofcasting.Cinematography, production design, costume, editing, music - they'reall top of the range. But in the end it's down to McDormand andRockwell, and the brilliant script.
