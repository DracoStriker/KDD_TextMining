So predictable that you can complete the story arc in your head twentyminutes into the movie (I'm being generous; the trailers pretty muchgive it away). Ridiculous overacting: the acting in the earlyplantation scenes was so B-grade awful that I almost couldn't tellwhether Peele was satirizing a kind of black paranoia regardingsocially-awkward white behavior or trying to set them up as creepyvillains. Moves at a snail's pace towards the obvious: the white peopleactually want to subjugate all of the black people in the movie.Shocker there!Not that it would have helped, but even the ending fails to line upwith the worldview, and comes off as completely arbitrary - the herorides off into the night with his comic relief buddy. I half-expectedKaluuya's character to either get shot or imprisoned in this movie ofinescapable and systemic racism, and was surprised at how anticlimacticit ended up being. Peele's talent is wasted here; he should stick tocomedy.
