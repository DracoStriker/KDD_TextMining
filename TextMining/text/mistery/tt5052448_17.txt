I didn't really rate this movie as it just was not scary at all. Usual"creepy" characters, acting was mediocre and just the whole sillinessof it all just killed it for me. The whole crux of the story is very bizarre; A bunch of wealthy whitepeople duping, seducing and hypnotising black men so that they canforce a brain-swap to gain the physical attributes of black men andmake them servile to white people?! I didn't know if I was supposed tobe watching a horror film or a comedy but it definitely didn't hit themark on either. I couldn't help notice the racial digs in this filmtoo. Actually the whole film is one big racial dig come to think of it,and it's a dig toward BOTH black and white people. Silly film in myopinion which was neither scary nor funny.
