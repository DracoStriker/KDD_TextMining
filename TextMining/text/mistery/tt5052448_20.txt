I regret paying for this on blue ray. The hype gave more to this moviethen it deserved. As it was from the makers of Insidious and conjuring,I thought this might be something enjoyable, since those movies arecampy, fun, roller coasters horror movies, that are set in a less thenbelievable world, so you can suspend your suspension of disbelief forthem. This movie has none of that element to it. While the acting andcinematography is fine in this, much like the conjuring and insidious,that however is all the good I can say for this, similarcinematography.The plot however ruins it. And I'm just gonna spoil the ending of themovie for you so you don't waste money on this. The big surprise of the movie is the family, including the daughterwho's in on it, use hypnotism to break any black people they makefriends with slowly, so they can prepare them for operation to removemost of their brains and have it replaced with white peoples brains, sothey are white people walking around in black peoples bodies.The main character gets away in the end BTW.I cannot help but feel that the reason why this movie was given so muchmore hype then it actually deserved, was because despite how the moviewent along, the writers made effort to make every white person in thismovie into a villain, and every black person to be innocent victims. Ifthey made a movie like this but did the reversal of skin color on allthe cast, there would be screams from racism from social justicewarriors today, but its okay to make every white person in this movieevil. Thats why this movie got all the hype it did, because even if itsa bad story, as long as all white guys are vilified and all black guysare saints, its perfectly fine. And no, I'm not racist saying that,this is one the fault of the movie makers awful storytelling. Do not buy this movie based on the hype it was given. Only get this forthe cinematography.
