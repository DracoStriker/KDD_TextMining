This has got to be one of the most OVER-RATED crappy movies that I haveever seen...100% on Rotton Tomatoes basically tells me that someone haseither been paid quite a bit of money to buy a bogus review...Orsomebody has sold their soul to the devil...Daniel Kaluuya And LilRel Howery Were The Only Good Elements To ThisStupid Movie...Daniel's acting was good...And Lilrel Howery wasactually quite funny...Plus I did like the revelation surrounding thelead character's girlfriend...The fact that his girlfriend was usingherself as bait to lure people into this (so-called) nightmare was avery nice twist...Other then that...This movie is idiotic and stupid...First of all...Themain character was an idiot...Because once he realized that snapping apicture with his cell phone would bring black people back toreality...He could have had himself a lot more backup...So he gets themoron of the year award for that alone...And then there's the most pathetic excuse of a so-called surprise twistending that many fans actually enjoyed...The ending to me felt morelike an offensive punchline to a very dumb joke...Putting old whitepeople's brains into the bodies of black people so that the superiorwhite minds can control/possess the bodies of black people withsuperior body genetics..??Even Adolf Hitler would have found this idea to be extremely stupid andmoronic...Combine Hitler's idea of creating a master race...With thatold concept: "If you can't beat em, join em"...And you got this stupidmovie...I can't wait for the inevitable backlash that this movie isgonna get in the long run...That's what I'm hoping for anyway...BecauseEither I Have Bad Taste In Movies...Or Everyone Else Does...Because"Get Out" Sucked...And That's All There Is Too It...
