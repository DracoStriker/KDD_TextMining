Get Out provided me with something I long for. The debut of a newfilmmaker that makes you look hopefully into the future. Jordan Peelehas done just that. He wrote and directed this smart, elegant film andeven made us find a new way to classify it. Horror, comedy, drama,social satire. What matters really is that it's a first of sorts andthen some. It introduced me also to a major talent in front of thecamera. Daniel Kaluuya is sheer perfection. As an actor he projects andprovokes empathy. Whatever your race or races you will be in his shoes,feeling what he's feeling. I was him, throughout. The gasps of fearmixed with the bursts of laughter from the audience - me included -made Get Out one of the most rewarding film experiences of 2017. Kudosalso to Bradley Whitford and the phenomenal Catherine Keener. They areterrifyingly recognizable and what about Caleb Landry Jones? Menacingenough and comic enough - he reminded me of Peter, Chris Elliott'scharacter in Everybody Loves Raymond - to be all the things he neededto be. Perfect. As is the human relief provided by the wonderful MarcusHenderson. As you may gather I'm celebrating. So, Mr Peele, thank youvery much.
