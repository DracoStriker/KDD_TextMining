A reality check of mine is always: how does X or Y sound when areligion or race in the statement/book/movie is reversed. This filmcould NOT have been made, if the black hero had been white and thewhite villains had been black. It is so stereotyped. Don't get mewrong, it was an intelligent film and a deep, deserved critique of ourmodern society. It was well-filmed and a good watch throughout. It'sjust: Leni Riefenstahl also made a cinematically good documentary aboutsome or the other Nazi Olympic games and that is rightly denounced asbeing racist. This film is a Leni Riefenstahl. Only it has the whiteguys in the stereotypical villain role. And suddenly its all okay.We're allowed to be racist about white people and call it art. Uhuh. Agood film. I enjoyed it. But: No, deeply, disturbing and racist.
