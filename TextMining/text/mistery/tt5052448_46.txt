Jordan Peele has made a smoothly entertaining and smart thriller out ofmaterial familiar from The Stepford Wives, Seconds, Night of the LivingDead and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. The film doesn't have anoriginal bone in its body, but it's lively, funny and discomfitingnonetheless and it provides a few pleasurable jolts while nimbledirection and an able cast compensate for the plot's predictability. InGet Out the buildup is ultimately more satisfying and memorable thanthe payoff and the revelations feel rushed and somewhat murky. Andthough the finale is done with admirable restraint in the goredepartment, Get Out cries out for a better, more original andthought-provoking conclusion. A good, but somewhat disappointing filmconsidering all the hype and though it's superior to Don't Breathe andSplit, it isn't original or distinctive enough to be a classic, butjust good enough to warrant a viewing.
