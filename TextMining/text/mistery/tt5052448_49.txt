This movie is supposed to be a suspense film? It spends more timemaking white people look like the devil than it does issuing any realsuspense or terror. Everything can be seen coming a mile away. A ladystirs her tea in front of you and your hypnotized? Really? White peopleget together to hold secret auctions of black people? A brain surgeonand psychiatrist just happen to be married so they can wreak theirhavoc on black people? I didn't get creeped out or scared the entiremovie. Kind of boring actually. Literally no real scares in this movie.I don't know what they were going for here but it just doesn't work.Nothing meshed.
