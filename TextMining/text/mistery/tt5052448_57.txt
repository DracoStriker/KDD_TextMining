Lets start by saying, this is pretty much the best movie I have seenthis year. The story is great, easy to get into it and unsettling.Starting with the basic. The acting was top notch. The girl kind offall flat at the end but other than that, great all around. Main andsupport and even the one liner are very good.The setting and the camera work was great yet again. Only one thingthat to me made no sense but it is minor. The rest was perfect in myopinion.The story was fun for everyone. If you are a black person, you will seean "exaggerated" version of things that might happen. If you are not,the movie does a great job in putting you in his shoes. Back to thestory, t starts slow but not boring and ramps up fast. It keeps youguessing. To be honest, I was expecting something very different as aplot twist but the way they went works. I found one hole in the story Ican't explain but I am guessing it is explain in the extended ordeleted scenes. There is no jump scare, no cheap gimmick, only a goodstory that keeps you in suspense.I don't know how to explain it with no spoiler but YOU NEED TO WATCHTHIS! If horror is not your type of movie, this is still a great moviefor you. It is more of a thriller movie with a horror story.Worth it!
