Not an original or worthwhile piece of cinema.Just more racist Communist SJW cult nonsense.The media says it's 99% awesome though, which is unfortunate, becausethe movie never really gets a laugh bigger than that Wag the Dog joke.In fact, if you absolutely must watch a "hate whitey" horror comedyTales From the Hood is a much, much better choice.
