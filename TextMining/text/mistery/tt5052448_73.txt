Plot wise it's intriguing they've taken the race card, but not originalin it's concept (Invasion of The Body Snatchers) anyone? Daniel Kaluuya & Catherine Keener stood out in their acting as yougenuinely believe them all the way through. It's raw.I felt the directing could of been improved. Take the scene whenGeorgina poured tea at the table. That whole scene of her standingthere for a long time, the awkward staring into the distance and clunkyediting.. It was almost forced when it needed to be discreet so onlyChris noticed, but the blatant try- hard of the scene made me say,'really? if this really happened, someone would of seen it'..Shortening the stare would of made a greater impact. The music in the revealing of the surgeon room scene was far too 'epic'and made the scene almost comedic. It ruined the 'creepy' undertones.Finally, the connection or should I say lack there of between Chris &Rose was cardboard. Though, that could be down to the flat scriptwriting between them. A good film to compare this to is, 'The Invitation' as they follow asimilar structure/directing style. BUT, is much more put together than'GetOut'.
