I feel so sorry for myself after trying out this movie. The reviewersgave it good scores, but since this movie was injected with a milliondifferent ways to make white people look racist and tons of sexualinnuendo between our handsome male lead and our resident sexy whitegirl, I guess it would have been politically incorrect for reviewers tohave even a microscopic sized spine to criticize it. I mean hell, areyou into like toe-nail fetishes? Femdom? you might like a scene or two,but the rest will give you cancer.I can honestly say, this movie's writing is worse than anything I'veseen before. Twilight? Yeah. It's worse. The acting is almost as bad,especially from the supporting cast. But really it's just everythingabout the writing, I bet I could have written a better film when I wasin 4th grade. I am writing this review so that you don't waste yourtime. Please don't waste your time. Please. Avoid like the plague, notworth even 1 star, piece of horse crap of a film.For the record, I didn't make it past the first 25 minutes, I don'tcare what happens after that, I already lost 25 minutes I'll never getback to the worst writing I've ever witnessed. Everyone involved inthis film should be ASHAMED. They should have just made a porno withthe two lead actors.
