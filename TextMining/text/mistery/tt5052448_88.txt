The trailer to this movie was about the most exciting thing about it.It is very deceiving in making you think that this is going to be aroller-coaster experience. I found it very boring and it simply draggedon. It featured a couple of my favourite actors like Catherine Keenerand Stephen Root which was about the only good thing about it. Apartfrom that I wish I had spent 104 minutes watching something else.
