I was surprised by this film but not impressed. Acting was excellentbut I'm not convinced the writer/directors intent is forward thinking.If anything, the humor is at the expense of white people and even moreinsulting to bi-racial people. What black people perceive as racist isreally ignorance at its most embarrassing.
