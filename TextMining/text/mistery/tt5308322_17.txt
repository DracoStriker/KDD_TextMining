Comedy, horror drama. The heroine played by Jessica Rothe is murderedat the end of her birthday! The murderer is disguised by a 'baby face'mask, and she immediately wakes up at the beginning of the same day,over and over and over again. She now knows what will happen during thecourse of the repeating day and we then see her murdered again, eachtime in a different manner. Every time she wakes we see that she has suffered some injury relevantto the murder, and these accumulate over the passing days. Her urgentneed is to slowly piece together the evidence in the course of eachrepeating day until she can determine who the killer is. Every morningher frustration grows but at least she slowly progresses towardsknowing who the killer is. Every morning we see her realise thatreliving the same day gives her the opportunity to slowly learn how tobe a better person. Comparison with 'Ground Hog Day' and 'Edge of Tomorrow' are inevitable? GHD is even referenced at the end during a brief conversation. Jessica Rothe's performance is the only thing stopping this feelinglike a very low budget made for T.V. movie.
