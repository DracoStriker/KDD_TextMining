Wow..this is really a rip-off of Groundhog Day--they even acknowledgeit in the movie. It also had wooden acting, inconsistencies galore andzero scare factor (the PG-13 rating was a dead giveaway as that's asbad sign in a horror movie). The lead actress looks like she could beon her way to some success...but just not in this. The most irritatingpart for me (not giving anything way due to trailer) is that no matterhow long or short she 'lingers' on the repeated opening scenario...thenext sequence of events are always in the same. That just wouldn't bethe case IRL. Anyway. I wanted to like it as it had good premise, butit just didn't do it for me.
