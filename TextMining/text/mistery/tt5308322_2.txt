When I saw the trailer for this movie I admit I rolled my eyes andgroaned that they were trotting out the circular time gimmick again. Itwas of course classic in Groundhog Day, but never seemed to click sincethen. I was dubious, but after seeing it with my own eyes, I can say Ihad a great time. I'm not sure if Blum House intended it to be funny,but it had a lot of humor in it, enough I would say to qualify it as adark comedy. The cast was superb and while it didn't offer anythinggroundbreaking in terms of murders/deaths, I didn't mind because thestory was so well connected and it really had me guessing right upuntil the end. Another litmus test for the quality of this movie isthat the audience was rather quiet during the presentation. I've beento enough of these films to know that when you get a young audienceseated in the dark and the film is a snooze, they'll start to talk andwhisper and just annoy the Hell out of you. This movie managed to holdthe attention of the entire audience and in this day and age I mustsay, that is an achievement in and of itself. I wasn't prepared toenjoy Happy Death Day as much as I did, but even I can admit when I waswrong. It worked from start to finish. I wasn't aware that ScottLobdell wrote the script, but when I saw his name in the credits, Irealized another reason I enjoyed it. I am familiar with his writing inthe comic book industry and he is one of the more notable scribes. It'sgood to see the skills transfer.
