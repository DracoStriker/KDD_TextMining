I figured, as with most horror films I've tried to watch over the lastfew years, I'd turn this one off midway through, but I ended upcompletely drawn in and fascinated by this hugely well directed, wellacted and well conceived film that put the fun back in horror for me. They just don't make them like this anymore. The characters werequirky, accessible and really well developed, specifically theprotagonist. I've never heard of the actress who plays the primaryrole, but she has earned her stripes as a bonafide scream queen.Speaking of Scream, Wes Craven's great 90's saga, Happy Death Day takesme back to the greats of high concept, well thought out stories thatdon't have to be dumbed-down with gratuitous, hypersexualized, gorycontent for audiences. They're self aware, not afraid to poke fun atthemselves, and invigorating to a genre that has been missing this typeof cinematic adventure. Happy Death Day takes the viewer on a brilliantride. You'll laugh, you'll jump, you'll enjoy it without feeling likeyou just watched a snuff film.
