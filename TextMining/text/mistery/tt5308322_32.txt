I was pleasantly surprised by this film! I went in expecting it to be arepetitive storyline incorporating a mad man in a stereotypical dollmask. I can truthfully say it definitely surprised me! As seen in thepreviews, Tree is reliving her birthday over and over, trying to figureout the man behind the mask. While the movie is a thriller, it wasreally the surprising pop ups that get you. I really recommend thismovie to anyone finding themselves wanting a fun movie that isn't onlygoing to make you spill your popcorn, but also leave the theatrethinking about everything you just watched unfold on screen.
