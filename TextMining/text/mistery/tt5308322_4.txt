Happy Death Day is one of the worst horror films of 2017. The cast ishighly irritating, and just forgettable. Tree Gelbman yes you read thatright, the main character is named Tree, played by Jessica Rothe. Hercharacter is nothing that I even care for, just an ignorant girl from arich family acting like she is better than anyone around her, hersorority sisters are just as pathetic. So here we sit watching someover privileged character walk through the steps of a "Groundhog Day"style film, living her death over and over again, which was portrayedin the trailer. Scott Lobdell was the writer for this terrible film, and in my opinionhighly plagiarized from Groundhog Day, except this hack of a writerwill not be sued because the story was tweaked enough and he turned itinto a horror slasher style film, instead of a comedy. If people want to pay money to see such drivel then by all means, goright ahead. There is no likable character, I wanted them all to die,and there is no point to see this film unless it's something to fallasleep to. That's it folks move along now nothing to see here. 6.7 is afake rating made by this fake website and fake people. This is a bigold zero people. Avoid at all costs.
