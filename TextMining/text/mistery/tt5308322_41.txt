If you've seen Groundhog Day and Before I fall, then you should roughlyknow what the movie is about. The story-line is superb for it is acomedy and horror and whodunit movie all rolled into one. This isJessica Rothe's second movie that I have seen, the Tribe being theother one. Yes I have not seen La La Land, because I hate musicals.Suffice to say Rothe is one of those actors who play their roles veryconvincingly. I am glad the test audience reacted furiously to theoriginal ending of the movie and the director opted for the alternativeending. I enjoyed it therefore I recommend it. A nice change to typicalHalloween season movies!
