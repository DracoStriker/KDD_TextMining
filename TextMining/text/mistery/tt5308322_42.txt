i usually don't write reviews of films that i don't like,but becausethe of the good ratings almost everywere my wife decided to have a tryat this horror movie,with me as a hand-holder in case of gut wrenchingmoments. I liked the 10 first minutes till the miss found a music boxin a tunnel.how exciting i thought,but then the looping started ,samesubject over and over till i guess this went on for 7 times orwhatever.Then i thought that this must be the end(it definitely shouldhave been)but it lasted even further 15 minutes and 2 more loops into avery disappointing end.looping movies are difficult to make and looping horror movies are asupertight narrow genre to succeed in, and i think this film lackedfantasy and intelligence to wake interrest. this script has nooriginality at all.take a look back to the 80's and learn.....we shall all praise the headactress's nice appearance and patience onthe screen,and also the editing and cinematography of this film,whichmakes a recovery of the total score at 3 stars
