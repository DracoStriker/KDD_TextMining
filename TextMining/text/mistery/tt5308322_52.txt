This film is really one of a kind. It does a terrific job of evokingfear, as well as making you laugh out loud. The film itself issatirical in nature. It truly is a film everyone should go see, and isenjoyable for all ages. The film builds up well, and continues tosucceed up until the end. The ending is very outrageous in nature, andseems to be a forced plot twist filled with ridiculous exposition. Theending will either leave you amused, or just disappointed. This film isworth it though!
