Movie with the time loop concept is interesting but really need manygood elements in it. It must contain good story, morale message, andalso the brilliant plot twist is a must. And what makes this moviegreat ? Yeah it because Happy Death Day has all of the importantelement. Simple story with popular girl in university, with gooddirecting, the repeated scene because of time loop doesn't seem boring.They can make the audience to be curious and sometimes with extracomedy it makes this film really great !No doubt you will like this horror thriller movie because it is notsimilar like usual horror movie with some ghost, devil, or mysteriousphenomenon. Its more like thriller movie with mysterious psychopaththat kills you and you just cant escape from it. Even if I think thismovie is brilliant, I admit that with this film concept like this, Ilike better if the movie genre is drama because it can offer you muchmore emotional, dramatic, and better morale message.
