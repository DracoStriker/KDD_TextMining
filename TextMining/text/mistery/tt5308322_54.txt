I am 45 and i have been watching horror movies since i was 12. My firstbeing Halloween 2.No horror movie score a 6.7 right there the rating is fake and peoplewho post all those positive reviews are fake too, this movie is ratedPG13 for god sake.I have seen fake reviews compare this from ground hog day to scream...really hey no not at all sorry.First of all you take a bunch of annoying people, the lead its hard tohave pity for her, yes i remember my teenage years and women like hertreating me so bad, so i could care less about her character gettingkilled like 20 times in the movie. You have to give the audiencesomething to care about the lead this one does not. Or all her annoyingfriends.Pretty much so called actor in this movie is annoying from start tofinish. I am glad this was a double feature and i did not pay fullprice for this garbage.I really hope that people get this movie close to a 3 or a 4 which iswhat it deserve.
