I truly not recommend this movie to anyone. In the first ten minutes,it seems kinda cool, but after that the girl keeps dying, and wakingup, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, andwaking up, and dying, and waking up.. Also, it is pretty obvious whowants to kill her from the very beginning of the movie. It is sopointed out that she is being such a bitch to her roommate, that youcan guess that it is her who wants to harm her. More over, at somepoints, the movie tries to hard to be funny. The only part that ismiled (not laughed), it was when her boyfriend pranked her in the end.I found the other parts really lame. To sum up, as I've already said,this may be my last review, cause I almost died of boredom. Not tryingto be a bitch, but it was a disaster for me.
