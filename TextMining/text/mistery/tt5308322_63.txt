I had a blast with this film and i absolutely loved itYes I know this concept has been done before; Groundhog Day, SourceCode, Edge of Tomorrow and etc BUT this film adds a new spin on the "same day repeats until themystery is solved" concept by taking it and merging it with a slasherfilm premiseNow this kind of film could easily go downhill if wrongly executed butHappy Death Day does a decent job of handling this conceptIt has fun with it and pokes fun at it The film is also a bit self aware of the clichés and tropes of theslasher genre so it's understandable when something a bit dumb happensIt wastes no time and you can easily breeze through the entire filmwithout feeling any fatigue because every twist and turn in the filmkeeps it fresh and entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat,it's also of the right run time, just 1 hour 35 something minutes whichfelt right for this film It's very well shot too surprisingly, I don't think I've seen any ofChris Landon(the director of this film)'s work before but he impressedme with this filmThere is a lot of humor which adds to the film because the film doesn'ttake itself too seriously and doesn't take a very dark route eventhough it is still a horror film It also has some cool scares and suspenseful moments, not too scary butthat's fine by me because of the rest of the film kept me engagedI have to mention the lead actress because my review would not becomplete without mentioning her, Jessica Roth did a fantastic job asthe lead girl in this film, her performance was so charismatic and itsapparent that she enjoyed this role a lot because she delivered abetter performance than i expected, A break out star performance and ihope to see her in more films now And not just the performance, her character development in the film wassimple but handled well, and combined with her performance, it made hercharacter and her performance very likableThe mystery of the film is engaging although once it is revealed, youmight criticize some parts of it but overall the film worked so littleproblems can be overlookedThe soundtrack is cool too, i looked for some of the songs after thefilm ended and i got hooked It may not be a classic or a genre defining film but if you just wantto forget your problems and have a fun time with maybe an easy to watchfilm, pick this up, Would be even better if you watch it in a groupwith maybe your friends, it'll be a good experience because Happy DeathDay is very enjoyable
