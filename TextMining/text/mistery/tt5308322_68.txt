When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it looked quiteinteresting. Sure, the Groundhog Day plot seems to be becoming a clichénowadays (with movies like Before I Fall), and it was most likely goingto be a jump-scare-infested film, since it came from Blumhouse, but Iactually had interests in seeing this film, so I went and saw this witha friend.I thought the movie was okay, but nothing special. I liked the premise,I liked how the girl went from this unlikable bitch to an actual caringperson as the film went on, and I liked how she gradually learned fromthe error of her ways. I also liked the design of the mask and how somany people had it in their possession, which only makes it harder toguess who the killer is.But no film is without its flaws.In some parts, it seemed like they were trying to go somewhere, likewhen the girl is spying on the people who she thinks might be out tokill her, but that was quickly dropped. The scene where she takes outthat criminal was pretty good, but it then came off as pointless oncethe twist came. Oh, and speaking of that, while I did admire the twistand how they chose an unsuspecting person, the heroine jumped to theconclusion WAY too fast. Like, she just assumes all these things and itends up being right. Like, you need to build up stuff like that. Youcan't just rush it.Overall, this movie was okay. It didn't rely too heavily onjump-scares, so I applaud them for that. Give it a watch if you want.
