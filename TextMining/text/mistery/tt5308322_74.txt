So I went out last night and saw this movie, ended up with the entiretheatre to myself. Great movie! It was fun to sit through, not astedious as Groundhog Day. Though it can be a predictable movie, as faras whodunit, it is a fun, campy romp of a movie that isn't afraid tomock itself. I'd watch it again.
