This film is like a weird mix of Groundhog Day and Scream. So you startby looking at this typical American college environment and thistypical sorority girl and all the clichés that one might expect fromsuch themes: girls being mean to each other, teenage romance, stupidparties, all those things. The twist is.. Tree, the main character, iskilled on her birthday by a masked assassin only to wake up again inthe previous morning. It is implied that the loop will not end untilshe survives.Now, this film is not a masterpiece and it doesn't try to be one. Thescript is kept simple, but it is effective. Will our hero be able tofind out who the killer is? Will she run out of lives? Can you figureit out? I thought I would, but I didn't. Turns out the plot tricks youinto thinking the clichés will continue, yet some times they don't andsome times they do. I think this was a good Hallowe'en film.
