This movie isn't art, I start by saying this because that's the firstthing you should know. However if you go into a movie called "HappyDeath Day" expecting art then i cant help you. Overall the movie is somuch damn fun. While yes i can understand why some folks would call ithorrible, because it essentially is, its still fun. The writing isn'tanything to write home about but even a lot of the bad cringe lines arefunny, and its so much fun watching it with your friends. Watch it foryourself, it certainly is a movie I'd watch again. Just good overallfun.
