After reading some of the reviewers trash this film, even though theydidn't see it, I had to comment on this film. Also after readingglowing reviews for pretty awful films, IT and Blade Runner 2049, Ineeded to set the record straight. If you enjoyed Drag Me To Hell in aPG13 setting, you'll love Happy Death Day. Tree is a sorority girl, high fashion, snobby, and no carbs. She wakesup in some guy's dorm room, much to her dismay, only to realize she'sreliving the day of her birthday and murder over and over again.Laughs, a few good scares, plot twists, and even a single tear (Yes,the acting is that good and Tree shows real growth) make this a funescape in the magical world of the movies. This movie doesn't have muchgore and only has sexual innuendos, which give the PG13 rating.THIS IS A FILM WORTH SEEING! CAMPY HORROR AT ITS BEST!
