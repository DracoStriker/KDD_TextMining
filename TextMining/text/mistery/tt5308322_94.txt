So, where to we start. This movie at first instance looks innovatingand fresh, but the more forward it goes, the more bored you becomes.The plot looks kind of innovative, a groundhog day meets horror, butthe groundhog day premise with different genre is done better with Edgeof tomorrow. The comedy in this film is equally awful, and the scaresaren't scary enough. It's like someone saw the cabin in the woods andmade his own fan fiction with a more serious tone. The characters areblank and offers nothing new. Some of them are there for comic reliefbut they fail too. The only good thing about this movie is that itspacing is somewhat good, not too slow, not too fast, and also that thepremise is not half bad. But in the fall, you should better watch bladerunner 2049 or Jackie Chan's The foreigner. These two films deservemore attention than this piece of crap. Not like I am forcing you, butjust giving an opinion.
