I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was very good as was the story.There were a number of red herrings to keep the audience guessing and afew enjoyable plot twists. There was even realistic and pronouncedcharacter development -- something rarely seen and even more rarelydone well in modern cinema. I laughed a lot more than I cringed, so Iwould probably classify this as more of a comedy than a horror movie.For those who care about such things, there was little to no gore,minimal bad language, and no overt nudity.
