Atmospheric, capable thriller but feels shopworn and its productionmarred by TV-style shot selection and editing. Story of Indianreservation killing is chock-a-block with grim and squalid images we'veseen in other stories with same old Hollywood virtue-signaling aboutawful white man's depredations. Two leads are adequate but nothingremarkable in the writing to lift or distinguish their characters.We've seen it before. Hunter/tracker Renner offers awkward expositionspeech about his family tragedy (we know its coming, and it does notcome seamlessly for the story). Scenes of brutality are fairlypredictable, and so are the antagonists. For great take on murder onIndian reservation story check out Thunderheart.
