I'm at a loss to see why this film has been well reviewed.It has a so-so plot, characters who aren't particularly engaging, fartoo many snowmobile scenes (did the director really think we'd neverseen one before?) and above all it has a dialogue soundtrack that isunintelligible in too many places.Cowboys and native Americans alike mumble or whisper far too much,sometimes hardly moving their lips - so there's little visual help fromthere. I think I decoded not much more than 50% of the dialogue.Avoid it unless you can see it with subtitles. Even then, it's reallynothing special at all.
