Director Sheridan wrote Sicario and Hell or High Water, two of the mostthoughtfully intense films of the last couple years, but this is(essentially) his directing debut. However, somehow he seems to havefocused so much on the beauty of the visuals (which truly are stunning)that the script took a backseat. With a lack of character ordistinction, and an unexpected plethora of clichéd storytelling andon-the-nose dialogue, Wind River is little more than a beautiful butham-fisted allegory of how Native Americans have been poorly treated.Renner and Olsen take a break from their Avengers duties to join upwith a local sheriff (scene-stealer Greene) to solve a crime in thefrozen tundra of a Wyoming Indian reservation. The mystery itself, ayoung woman found brutalized and frozen in the woods, is an absorbingone, thanks to the skill in the filmmaking details. A uniquelyforeboding score, intensely authentic action, gorgeously gruesome deadbodies atop scenic snow, and a lead hero who displays an aptitude forcool vengeance that should make Liam Neeson proud, all help boost theengagement. Unfortunately, once the mystery is resolved and explained,it's less, "Woah!", and more "Oh?". The appeal of the mystery begins todissipate when the conclusion is unsatisfying, leaving us with moreunintended questions than answers: Why is the camera so shaky duringsimple dialogue scenes? What's with the hackneyed one-liners? Are theseperformances nicely subtle, or just dry as a bone? Is this the best wecan do to portray the suffering of Indian-Americans? Wind River mighthave some helpful thoughts on wrestling grief, but it's mostly justunnecessarily brooding and too uncomplicated in its anger.
