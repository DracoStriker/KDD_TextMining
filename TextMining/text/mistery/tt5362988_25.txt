Written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. This is the guy who wrote HELLOR HIGH WATER and SICARIO, so you know what to expect. It's a very slowmovie, taking place in a snowy Native American reservation. A young FBIfemale agent is sent to investigate a death.It's not that bad... but it's not that great either. It's slow in agood way, but also slow in a bad way. It has a good snowy isolationatmosphere, some good emotional situations. But still, it was too slowand too little happens. It's only 107 min long but it felt like a 2.5hours movie.With Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen who looks like a young MichellePfeiffer.
