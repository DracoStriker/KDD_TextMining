Wind RiverFor some reason US Fish and Wildlife officers have a bad habit ofshooting defenseless black bears.Mind you, it's not the body of an animal that has been discovered inthis thriller, but a human.While he is hunting a mountain lion, Wind River Indian Reservation'sresident Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory (Jeremy Renner) finds thebodies of a Native female and a Caucasian male frozen in the middle ofnowhere.An FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) is dispatched to the isolated reserve toinvestigate, but with no knowledge of the terrain she must employCory's tracking skills to locate the killer.Although its heart is in the right place, bringing light to missingindigenous women, this neo- western with a Nick Cave compositionstumbles in its delivery. The mystery is far-fetched, while theindigenous cast simply serves as background scenery. Lastly, having a white corpse always get better response time from theauthorities.
