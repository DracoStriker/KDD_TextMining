Hearing the raving reviews about Wind River caught my attention butonly after finding out that it was written and directed by TaylorSheridan, the writer of last years Hell or High Water, which Iabsolutely love, did I decide that I'd definitely check it out in thetheatres. I have to admit I left kinda disappointed.During Wind River all I could think about was the resemblance to TrueDetective, season 2 that is:Both were written by someone who previously created something amazingand kind of special (True Detective season 1 and Hell or High Water),but ultimately failing to recreate that same magic, that lightning in abottle with their following work - Pizzolato's TD season 2 and nowSheridan's Wind River.Other than the circumstances of making them, they share the sameproblems in writing, directing and production and weirdly enough Ifound this to be true in their positive attributes as well. Wind River has impressive cinematography and an incredible sense ofchilling atmosphere, which actually made me feel cold and shaky attimes, creating a gloomy and depressed mood, which was complimented bythe incredible and fittingly melancholic soundtrack, again just like TDseason 2. This being said I did think that the story was quite basic,bit too simple and slightly unengaging, lacking layered well-written orat least unique characters. That being said the actors did a solid jobwith what they had, in TD- S2 it was Collin Farrel, Vince Vaughn andRachel McAddams and here Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen (along withGraham Greene who was probably my favourite) who elevated theirunderdeveloped characters with their performances. Some of the dialoguewhile having some well-thought out interesting ideas and touchingmoments felt a bit forced, unrealistic. Finally, the director! TrueDetective had Cary Fukunaga and Hell or High Water had David Mackenzie,the directors and writers complimented each other perfectly, but TDwithout Fukunaga and Sheridan directing feels like its missingsomething. All in all, both Wind River and season 2 of True Detective, whilehaving some pacing issues, are well above the average crime thrillerswe get nowadays (e.g.: Sleepless), that have personality and are worthseeing for sure (if only for their climax which is extremely satisfyingand touching in both cases).
