This was a great movie. I loved the suspense of the who done it. Iwould have to say this was one of the best parts I have seen JeremyRenner play in awhile. I can understand why his name is floating aroundfor best actor lists.The cinematography was beautiful.The story line was sad and showing the plight of a Native Americantribe.I highly recommend this film if you get a chance to see it.
