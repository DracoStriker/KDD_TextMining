i come here sometimes to look at how others perceived a film. rarely doi feel i've seen a story(no matter the genre) 'perfectly told'. nothingthat 'doesn't fit' added. this was one of those. and that you all feltit, too, is reflected in a much deserved high rating...good for youall. this was NOT a 'typical Hollywood film'. but, instead, to ME, oneof the films that makes Hollywood great. just that they still willinvest moneys to MAKE a story such as this. good on you all...and thankyou. i wait for films like this.
