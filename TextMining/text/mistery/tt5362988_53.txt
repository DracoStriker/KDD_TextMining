This was a thrilling movie with excellent acting, however I am confusedwith the statements at the end of the movie regarding missing nativewomen. The two native women in the movie were not missing. This was apolitical statement from Hollywood. We have an ongoing investigation inCanada regarding the many missing and murdered aboriginal women in ourcountry.
