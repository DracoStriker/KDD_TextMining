Why do they have to shake the camera while shooting? Absolutely hateit. I was feeling dizzy 10 minutes into the film. I may be only one ofthe few who cannot enjoy movies shot this way. Can they have some kindof warnings like 'Shot with shaking camera. May make you sick'.The fact that it uses lots of zoom-in close-ups is making it worse.
