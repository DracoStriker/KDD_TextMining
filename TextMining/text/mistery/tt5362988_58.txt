Really as soon as you see the white males, working in, gasp, oilextraction, you know where this is going. This despite the data clearlyshowing that in terms of violence against women, there is no higherrate perpetration cohort than Native American males.Native America women are the most victimized by rape, domestic violenceand murder because native American men commit those crimes areprofoundly higher rates.The same thing occurs in Canada. Native Americans Canadian women are 3%of Canada's population and 9% of murder victims. ie a 3x elevated rate.But Native American men in Canada commit murder at a 4x elevated rate.On top of that this film is generally bigoted against everyone. Thefemale FBI agent portrayed appearing competent on the surface, butdeeply brittle and fragile -- and in need of rescue by a man. TheNative American law enforcement are also unable to figure anything out,and also need the same guy.I would have not had a problem if this film had blamed US culture ingeneral for poverty and squalor of reservations and some of the blamefor the fact that it is Native Americans men who are hyper violent,Just as African American men are hyper violent (committing murder at 8xthe rest of the country does).Looking at conditions among these communities, which maybe the cause ofthe extremely high rape and murder rate by Native Americans men, wouldhave been a better backdrop
