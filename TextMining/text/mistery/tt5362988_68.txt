From the writer of Sicario & Hell or High Water comes another sharp,intense & thoroughly gripping crime thriller that also presents himhelming the director's chair this time. As neatly structured as it isexpertly directed, Wind River takes hold of the viewers' attention fromits opening moments, and doesn't let go until the very end.The story revolves around the murder of a young Native American womanand follows a local game tracker who discovered her body and laterassists a rookie FBI agent with the investigation. As the two gatheradditional clues, interrogate more people & close in on the suspects,the tracker's involvement in the case becomes more clear.Written & directed by Taylor Sheridan, Wind River makes excellent useof its cold surrounding and unfolds in a controlled & steady fashion,allowing the audience to gather all the information before moving on tothe next segment. Sheridan's direction is just as accomplished as hisscreenplay, for all the events coalesce eventually to culminate on abloody but wholly satisfying note.The wintry ambiance, cold surroundings & sparsely populated setting addto its grim, chilling aura. Cinematography makes sure that every momentis captured in a clear, concise fashion, and makes effective use ofcolour palette & lighting to enhance the image's intensity. Editingretains the mystery till the final revelation and paces the storysplendidly, while the muted score is in sync with its bitter tone.Coming to the acting department, its character-driven story is poweredby sincere performances from both Jeremy Renner & Elizabeth Olsen, withformer delivering a very measured, calculated & emotionally acuterendition while the latter articulates her rookie character'sinexperience & emotions with accuracy. The rest of the supporting castplay their part responsibly and don't leave anything to complain about.On an overall scale, Wind River is another winning material from TaylorSheridan that brilliantly showcases his directorial talents, especiallyhis firm grip on pacing & environment, and is one of the best cinematicsurprises of the year. Translated from paper to film canvas withrazor-sharp clarity, presenting Sheridan in total control of his craft,and steered by solid performances from its faithful cast, Wind River isabsolutely worth your time & money. Thoroughly recommended.
