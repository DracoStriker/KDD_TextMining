This is based on true events On an Indian Reservation in Wyoming,Hunter/Tracker Cory (Jeremy Renner) helps a new FBI agent Jane Banner(Elizabeth Olsen) to discover who killed Natalie (Kelsey Asbille).This moves along very nicely and the music is loud at times and that'sokay as it signals impending doom. Cory finds Natalie dead in the snowas she appeared to have been running from something. The Coroner won'tlist her as a homicide because the cause of death was lungs bursting inthe very cold although he believes it is a homicide. Jane needs it tobe a homicide in order to bring in other FBI agents, but now she has towork things out herself and enlists Cory's help.The photography is simply outstanding as is the cinematography. Theacting all around is very good, but sometimes the sound is a littlemuddled and it is difficult to hear character dialogues and one mustlisten carefully. You would think that Cory and FBI Jane would gather clues to determinewho killed Natalie, but this is not the case in its entirety. You'llsee. Well, they do so up to a point but the resolution will kind ofshock you, maybe. Even though Cory is a Hunter as he calls himself, we wondered who heworked for and on the side of his pick-up we see the words: Wild LifeOfficer. So he works for the State of Wyoming. Mystery solved. Hey, wehad to know. Notables: Graham Greene as Ben, the Tribal Chief of Police; GilBirmingham as Martin, Natalie's father. We see a lot of snow and snow mobiles racing here and there. Very cool.Would like to get one.All in all a very good thriller and again, the resolution may surpriseyou. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, Natalie is raped. Nudity: No. Language: Yes,some at times.
