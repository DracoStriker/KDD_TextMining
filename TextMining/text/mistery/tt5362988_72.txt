Being a fan of Taylor Sheridan's Sicario and Hell or High Water, Iexpected the same level of suspense, drama, believable characters andcinematography. By and large I received this. He is setting a high barfor himself.A big positive is a great cast, from the smaller roles to the two mainleads. Jeremy Renner at his most comfortable, almost downplaying hischaracter to accommodate Elizabeth Olsen who, yet again, absolutelycompounds my belief she has a great career ahead of her. She needs moreleading roles with a decent script and complex characters, without adoubt. She is wasted in the blockbuster movies such as the Avengers andGodzilla (but I guess they pay the bills!). I will be seeking her outin Kodachrome with haste. People may say she was given a meek, 'rabbit caught in the headlights'role here. I feel this isn't really the point, just simply theopportunity to tell a story of a character becoming stronger, not asuper hero, just stronger. Wind River sets the tone for a bleak, dare I say, boring, setting of areservation with a 'wild west like' lawless nature. It then plays out awell paced whodunnit thriller. I rarely say this but I actually feel itcould have benefited from 10-15 mins added to the runn time to fleshout the plot line further. Or maybe I feel that way simply because Iwas enjoying it so much?The script was concise and I can't think of a scene I thought wassuperfluous to the plot. No mean feat in a modern film. A sign of agood editor.Sadly, it is by no means perfect. I feel more could have been made ofthe injustices taken place on the reservation and the poor treatment ofNative Americans. Also, there were a couple of scenes with a shaky camwhich I cannot believe was purposeful, if so, it was unnecessary anddistracting.The film left me damning myself for not making the time to see this inthe cinema, I know for a fact I would have enjoyed it more.This is everything the recent 'The Snowman' should have been.
