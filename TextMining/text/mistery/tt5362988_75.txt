Renner at the top of his craft, and Elizabeth Olson, about who I wasconcerned, was well cast as the green FBI agent, whose character comesthrough when the situation required it. Bernthal has a very small part.Graham Green and Gil Birmingham are perfect mixes of stoicism andIndian humor. The Utah (made to look like Wyoming) weather has a majorrole as well, although I never knew if it was following direction ordoing it improv. The story is an intense drama with action to match,based on actual events on the Wind River Indian Reservation which has aper-capita crime rate that makes Chicago look like Mayberry. The climaxwas set up so suddenly it actually added an element of lethal humor toit. It definitely has a similar flavor to "Hell or High Water" in whichSheridan acted, only better. I noted the absence of any disclaimerabout any animals being harmed. I don't know if that's still routinelybeing put in the credits or not, but I don't think it would apply here,though it was about an animal being hunted, Renner's character's job.
