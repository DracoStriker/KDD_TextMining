Bad guys shoot, kill and rape because they are evil. 0 dimensionalbaddies whose only purpose is to make the viewer feel hate, but the actis so ridiculous you can only hate the writer for creating such sh!t. Cops acts like they are characters from South Park parodying the worstand most cliché law enforcement scene from any movie ever, expect theyare being serious and it is not funny. Pretty sure half of them hadnever seen a gun before. I can't take this movie seriously in any way or form. It's utterlyridiculous and can only be viewed as an insult towards the viewer'sintelligent.
