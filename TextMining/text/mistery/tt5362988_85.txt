Taylor Sheridan has the gift of creating catching stories, which iswriters' most valuable quality: an ability you could simply have orhave not.So even if the cast was exceptionally good and everybody did great, youcan't help but notice his script, his direction and the atmosphere hecreated. The present title is a thriller (just like 'Hell or High Water'), fullof lovely and endearing characters. You'll love the people, the place,the snow and everything... and at the end you'll probably find yourselfwaiting for a next title from this very talented Author.
