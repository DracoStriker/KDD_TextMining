Wind River is a prime example of a murder mystery/ thriller film doneright. Directed by Taylor Sheridan, and set on the Wind River NativeReservation in Wyoming, USA, the story follows the duo of a wild lifeofficer (Jeremy Renner) and an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) as theytrack down the murderer of a teenage girl. The plot that unfolds willblow ones mind.One must praise Taylor Sheridan for his screen writing/directingabilities. Wind River exemplifies the definition of a true thriller ashe builds suspense gradually throughout the film. The first twentyminutes of the film seem uneventful as it is used to introduce thecharacters and the situation, but after that one is left biting theirnails for the remainder of the film, as they are left in suspense.Jeremy Renner's portrayal of US Fish and Wildlife Service agent CoryLambert is one to be noted. Renner stays cool and collected for most ofthe film, but he exhibits sign of true anger at the right times.Elizabeth Olsen's depiction, however, is not as favorable as Renner's.Olsen's overacts her character as expresses her voice and emotions toomuch. She creates a character that seems like a whiny school girl.Overall the film can be given a ranking of 3/4. Sheridan's skillfulscreen writing and directorial skills are are shown throughout thefilm, as the suspense of the film builds to a highly climactic ending.Renner is great. Olsen is not as great with her portrayal. This,however, does not overshadow the plot. If this film does not get anOscar nod for best adapted screenplay it will surprising. Watch thisfilm. It is definitely worth the watch.
