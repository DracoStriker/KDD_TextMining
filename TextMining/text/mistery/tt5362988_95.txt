At last a decent movie. I was beginning to give up hope this year!Great acting, story and directing what more could one ask for.Shame to see it cost 11 mill and only grossed 4 mill and probably wentstraight to video; just goes to show audiences these days wouldn't knowa good film from a hole in the snow.If you are a discerning viewer, enjoy good solid writing and anengrossing story with great actors, visuals and lots of thoughtprovoking scenes; great shootout scene as well, then this is for you.If you just want cgi, nudity, foul language and bubblegum for the eyeslike most of the potato people that society seems to consist of, thengo watch Towie or some other reality bullshit - this ain't for you!
