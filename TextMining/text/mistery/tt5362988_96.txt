Why does nobody speak about Jeremy Renner's tremendous performance inthis? That should have gotten enormous early buzz as he hardly has beenany better during his career. Its a great crime mystery with anoriginal setting. Its shocking that this is actually based on a truestory. Taylor Sheridan chose the right screenplay for his directionaldebut and it turns out he is just as skilled as a director as he is asa writer. He chose his cast wisely. Jeremy Renner is absolutelyoutstanding as the troubled hunter. Elisabeth Olsen delivers a goodperformance however her character was a bit underwritten and she wasnot constantly believable. Still its a charismatic enough performance.Graham Greene gave another beautiful and humble performance as thepolice chief. The atmosphere works perfectly. I liked Nick Cave's scorea lot which added a lot to the film. The screenplay is excellentlywritten and its great how Sheridan builds up tense and fits in theright twists at the right moment. Definitely a little gem. Surely notflawless but effective, especially if you like thriller and mysteries.
