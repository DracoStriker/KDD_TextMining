This has to be one of the worst of Steven's movies. The script anddirecting was horrible. The characters and pace of the movie was soslow and highly unrealistic that many people just walked out of thetheatre.There is not really a lot of comedy or smart set ups like Ocean 11movies and instead it is a meandering of endless short set ups by idiotred necks that at first you think just perhaps there is some back storythat convinces us that they are really sharp like in Ocean 11 - butthey are not and it just gets tiresome and the directing is amateurishwith no style whatsoever and silly characters that do not add up to anyclever thriller or comedy.It is shocking to see 90% on Rotten Tomatoes or even a 7 on here. Theend has little punch and you're so exhausted and bored out of your mindeven with great actors but the pay off is unrealistic and you no longercare except to want to slap the writer and director for even making thestupid movie and wasting the great actors. I give it a 4 only because of the actors performances even with a lamescript. And please do not use Channing ever again. He is dull as paint
