Logan Lucky isn't half as amusing as it thinks it is. The film tries sohard to be funny that nearly all its attempts at humour fall flat. Ahighly generic crime comedy caper populated with uninterestingcharacters, it does mark the return of director Steven Soderbergh tofeature filmmaking but there's nothing about it that's even remotelyengaging or emotionally stimulating.The story follows the Logan brothers whose once promising future wasmarred by what they consider to be a family curse. The plot coverstheir attempt to reverse their fortunes as the two set out to executean elaborately planned robbery during a NASCAR race in North Carolina,and enlist the help of a convicted safecracker & his dimwitted brothersto pull off the heist without leaving behind a trace.Directed by Steven Soderbergh (known for Ocean's Trilogy & Magic Mike),Logan Lucky appears right within his comfort zone, given his pastsuccess with the crime caper genre, however the script is half-bakedand neither the characters nor the dialogues are refined enough, plusthe film as a whole is lacking in flavour. Also, it tries to jugglemany things at once but never really goes all in with any single one ofthose chosen elements.Soderbergh's trademarks are all over the place, evident in the swiftediting, smooth camera-work & the expected final twist that tieseverything together but what it's actually missing is authenticity.There is a sense of incompatibility between the actors & the respectivecharacters they play, save for Riley Keough who does well with whatshe's given. And to make up for that shortcoming, the entire castresorts to hamming in their given roles which doesn't help one bit.On an overall scale, Logan Lucky is a bland example of its genre thatmanages to create brief doses of interest but only in bits n pieces,and is forgettable for the most part. Be it the set up or thepreparation or the team recruitment or character introductions or theheist implementation itself, all these scenes are executed with suchdullness that it's never for once compelling. And it really is a shame,considering the charismatic cast it boasts. For me, Logan Lucky faresjust like every other Steven Soderbergh has done in the past: nothingmore than a run-of-the-mill effort.
