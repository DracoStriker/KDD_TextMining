Logan Lucky is a generally good film, it has highly competent acting,dialogue, and great dry comedy. The actors, particularly Channing Tatumand Adam Deuver incorporate mannerisms into their characters which makethem seem more real. However this movie isn't perfect, the charactersmotivations for their actions are vague and unconvincing, seeming to bethere to suit the plot rather than the character. The pacing of thisfilm is particularly poor. The movie starts by going to fast, confusingthe viewer and after the climax chooses to go way to slow boring heviewer. This is due to the movies mirroring on the Ocean's series,opting to do a fast paced montage of heist and planning and after whichexplains what happened. This makes the former half of the movieconfusing and the latter half being boring. However my praises weighout my complaints. This is a very funny movie and is worth seeing ifyou enjoyed the oceans series. 6/10
