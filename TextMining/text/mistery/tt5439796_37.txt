So the reason you pay $10 and sit two hours is for the big heistpayoff, right? Here it is: Instead of the cash being vacuumed intoplastic trash bags and hauled away by a garbage CART...get this...someof the cash is vacuumed into plastic trash bags and hauled away by agarbage TRUCK!I was anxiously expecting the big switcheroo to involve credit cards,NASCAR winnings, gold bullion...ANYTHING...except more trash bags in aslightly different trash disposal vehicle. Silly me (for wasting $10and two hours).
