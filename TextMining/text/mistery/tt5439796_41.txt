The script wasn't bad, and the actors were all great. But this movedWAY too slowly for a heist flick, particularly from the director ofOceans 11- 13.The entire Seth MacFarlane subplot could have been cut, as could manyof the long, slow shots of the lead characters driving back and forthbetween West Virginia and North Carolina. Because of the glacial pace, the humor never really gets going-- it'slike trying to roll a snowball down a hill, but it only goes a few feetbefore stopping, then they have to set up the next joke all over again.If they cut this down to 90 minutes, it would have been a lot moreexciting and funny to watch, but at just under 2 hours, it felt like adrag.
