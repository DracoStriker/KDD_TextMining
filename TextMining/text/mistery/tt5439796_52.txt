TheTruthDoor will not lie to you....this is an awful film.What kind of movie is "Logan Lucky" exactly? Is it a comedy? No. Not a single person laughed out-loud during theentire film. Is it a drama? Maybe, but it seems that the director intended for it tobe funny in places...which it isn't. And the drama is so bad becausethe actors are supposed to be dumb hillbillies which makes it difficultto know whether their dumb looks are dramatic or just dumb.Is it a thriller? Absolutely not. There were about 20 people in thetheater when I saw it and five of them left very early into the film.It is VERY boring and dumb.Is it a NASCAR film? No. The NASCAR portion of the film onlymaterializes near the end of the film.Is it worth seeing? No. It was the longest 2-hours of my life. I had toforce myself to stay and endure the torture.You want to see James Bond fake a hillbilly accent for 2-hours?
