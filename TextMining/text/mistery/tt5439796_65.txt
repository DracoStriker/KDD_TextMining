Just Seems Like A typical movie to me. I saw it because there aren'tmany movies that came out this year but it really was nothing special.bs action, plain storyline. another Hollywood cop out in my opinion. ijust want to see Hollywood or anyone make movies that speak to theaudience again. i love daniel craig hes an amazing actor and I've seenhim do some brilliant films, this wasn't one of them .
