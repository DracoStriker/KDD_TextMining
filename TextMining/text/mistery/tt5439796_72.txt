Need a 119-minute break from the news headlines? This Steven Soderberghcaper comedy, script by Rebecca Blunt, may be just the thing. There'snothing too serious going on (a planned heist at NASCAR's big MemorialDay weekend race), but the characters are so well-developed and theirrobbery plot so complicated and devious, your attention is capturedfrom the outset. Channing Tatum plays Jimmy Logan, out of work and, ifhis ex-wife has her way, out of his young daughter's life. He needsmoney. He proposes the theft to his brother Clyde (Adam Driver), theserious one, a bartender who lost an arm in Afghanistan. Clyde isreluctant, because he's convinced every family enterprise is destinedfor disaster?"the curse of the Logans." Love how he whips up a martinione-handed to quiet a mouthy British patron (Seth MacFarlane)! Theirsister Mellie (Riley Keough), a beautician, is in on it too and getssweet revenge on an irritating client who drives a purple Caddy. Seethat for yourself. To pull off this daring crime, the brothers needhelp. Unfortunately, the one man they know who really knows how to blowa safe is in prison. Part of their plan is to spring him for a day.Daniel Craig plays prisoner Joe Bang, in "a wonderfully wacky,show-stealing turn," said Todd McCarthy in The Hollywood Reporter. Joeinsists his two brothers (Jack Quaid and Briain Gleeson) be broughtinto the plot, and the likelihood of success appears to plummet asthese two slouch onto the scene. Prison warden Burns (Dwight Yoakam) isalso a treat. Many funny moments, some relatively subtle. Iparticularly enjoyed the big race's opening ceremony, which deployedall the worst excesses of American sports jingoism.
