In 2001 polarising director Steven Soderbergh unleashed the A-listfilled heist caper Ocean's Eleven into the marketplace.A fun, fast and knowingly self-aware experience that spawned a ratherforgettable trilogy, if Ocean's Eleven was Soderbergh's Rolls Royceheist caper, Logan Lucky is his billy-kart redneck version, filled withjust as many A-listers as his George Clooney lead feature's and in manyways a film just as enjoyable as his 2001 film, even if it's unlikelyto ever be remembered by many in the years to come.Coming out of a retirement that never felt like the real deal, whatexactly possessed Soderbergh to return to Hollywood and recruit one ofhis as per usual star studded cast's for a crime comedy set in the DeepSouth and centred on robbing a Nascar speedway we will never know andwhile Logan Lucky won't ever be regarded as a classic or even a memberof the director's best works, it's unlikely that there'd be many thatwouldn't find themselves having a great time with the seemingly cursedLogan family and their quest to strike it rich.Capturing the feels, vibes and small little eccentricities of the DeepSouth, Soderbergh does a great job of setting up the time and placethat sees Channing Tatum's divorced ex-football protégée Jimmy team upwith his one armed Iraq veteran brother Clyde, played by Adam Driverand his hairdressing, car loving sister Mellie played by Riley Keoughto rob the local Charlotte Motor Speedway and strike it rich, as thefamily recruit a rag-tag bunch of fellow locals that includes DanielCraig's explosive loving and incarcerated Joe Bang and his twodim-witted brothers.It's a motley crew and Soderbergh and his actors have a blast bringingthem to life with everything played straight, making the films few biglaugh sequences really stick (a scene involving a giant vacuum willhave you in stitches), even if it at times feels like Soderberghcould've amped up the slapstick variety of comedy a little bit as theheist gets into full swing.Despite the film arguably not making the most of its comedic potentialat times, it's always fantastic seeing such a capable collection ofactors having such a good time and with the likes of a hamming it upSeth MacFarlane and bit parts from Katie Holmes and Hilary Swank, it'shard not to enjoy Soderbergh's big screen return, that really is unlikeanything we've seen before and offers a fresh take on the well-worndumb criminals trying to make it rich sub-genre.Final Say ? Whilst forgettable in the long run and highly unbelievable, Logan Luckyis a smartly attuned heist caper that features a willing and on-songcast of professionals who help bring this redneck crime comedy to lifeand while his not breaking any new ground, its good if these are thetype of film's Soderbergh's making while back in the Hollywood fray,films only he wants to make, like no one else can do.3 ½ unpublished Game of Thrones books out of 5
