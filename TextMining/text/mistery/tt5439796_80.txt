The most painful experience I have been through in a theater. The moviecrawled at a snail's pace, the jokes were forced, and not at all funny.The theater emptied out about 1 hour in. Scene transitions weresharp... There was no coherent flow. I don't understand how anybody inthis experienced cast and crew could let such garbage onto the screen.It'll be a while before I can force myself back into a theater. It wastruly painful.
