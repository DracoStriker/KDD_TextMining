. . . in case anyone has forgotten for an instant. LOGAN LUCKY'sopening scene pictures "Jimmy Logan" as a West Virginian undergroundminer, losing his job because of a football disability. Recentlyreleased statistics from Football's Donated Brains Project prove thatupwards of 99.5% of ex-football players have Brains of Mush. On a PerCapita basis, West Virginia is America's hardest hit state in terms ofthis Gridiron Catastrophe. Rampant brain dysfunction has led to WVsuffering from the lowest levels of Education, Income, and Unionizationin America. West Virginia has had more large scale (that is, 100+fatalities) mining calamities than anywhere on earth, topping Russia,China, and South Africa's combined total. To add insult to injury, thetops of all the scenic mountains that would be State or National Parksanywhere else have been scraped away by giant mining machines in WestVirginia. LOGAN LUCKY depicts West Virginia as a lawless, crime-riddenenclave overseen by inept and corrupt government officials, just likeRussia. If you enjoy viewing squalid wastelands where anything goes,then LOGAN LUCKY is a "must-see" for you!
