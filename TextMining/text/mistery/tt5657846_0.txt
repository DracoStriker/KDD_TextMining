A group of heavy hitters, one way or another. Mark Whalberg starred andproduced "The Fighter" Mel Gibson gave us "Braveheart" and "The PassionOf The Christ" John Lithgow is one the best actors we've got, from thetranssexual in "The World According To Garp" to Winston Churchill in"The Crown" and Will Ferrel one of the most popular comedians aroundfor over a decade. All together in a comedy! Now, let me ask you. isthis the best they could come up with? Lazy, opportunistic without asingle original idea. Is this movie going to make any money? I'm askingbecause if it does, I should shut up and dedicate myself to gardeningor something like that. Clearly, money is the only reason behind thisenterprise and I'm giving it a 2 and not a 1 out of respect for thecrew and all their hard work.Phew.
