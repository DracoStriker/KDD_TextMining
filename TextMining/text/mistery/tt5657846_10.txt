. . . Christians exited as Confirmed Agnostics, with 21% sticking totheir guns, 10% coming out as Atheists, 2% adopting Pantheism, 1% goingWiccan, 3% leaving "Undecided," plus 2 Wise Guys checking the "None ofthe Above" Box, and one joker who wrote in a tally for "ComedyCentral." Speaking of firearms, DADDY'S HOME 2 promotes the wantonslaughter of American Founding Father Benjamin Franklin's U.S. NationalBird by drunken Pre-Teens, as well as shop-lifting as a way of life,not to mention incest, baby endangerment, and public brawling amiddense crowds. Vandalizing the USA's Power Grid (at a time when themajority of U.S. Citizens in Puerto Rico lack juice at their homes) fora few Yuks is a spectacularly ill-timed "joke," as is DADDY'S HOMETWO's promotion of indiscriminate under-age sexual activity asencouraged by Senator-Elect Roy Moore, Repug-AL, the story dominatingToday's Headlines. However, with trash like DADDY'S HOME filling ourtheaters, this flick reveals that National Chains including ShowtimeCinemas are now adopting a desperate "All our refreshments are free"policy to keep the newly-minted Agnostic Majority coming back.
