If you liked the first movie I think you will like this too. Lots ofslapstick comedy and over the top scenes. If you can handle that ithink it might would be worth your time.The characters were excellent with good dynamics when all together. Ilaughed a heck of a lot more than I expected too.Walhberg - Ferrell are becoming a pretty funny duo IMO.
