I love Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg and will laugh at just aboutanything in a comedy that they do, I really loved Daddy's Home one andspent hard earned money to see #2 in the theater instead of waiting tosee it for free in a few months on TV, but for the love of all this isholy, please leave politics out of film. I almost walked out afterpaying big $$. The parts that bother me were:**Men repeatedly kissing each other on the lips, the first five times igot it **All conservative characters were gun toting load mouths that wereunkind All the progressives were sensitive educated thoughtful and kind(in red shirts)** A line of little girls waiting to kiss a boy character - thats OK,but a little boy in the same line waiting to kiss the little boy - notOK - gay children in movies - please stop!The only reason I have 4 stars is that I did laugh and they poked funof both sides, but there were lectures galore for the right along theway. I go to the movies to forget my problems, not to get a lecturefrom the left. Just leave me out of it and stop forcing your"progressive" agenda down my throat - please give it a rest!!! You guysin Hollywood better get it soon or you are going to repeatedly losemoney.
