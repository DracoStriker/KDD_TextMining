I think its safe to say that The Killing of a Sacred Deer is theweirdest film I have watched this year. Is it good or bad weird, in myopinion it's bad. The main issue for me is some of the implausibleconversations between the characters, talking about watches, themenstrual cycle of daughter and comparing armpit hair. Anotherannoyance is how the main characters behave when major incidentshappen. For instance, the daughter is shouting in distress downstairs,but the mother continues to make the bed upstairs, I found thatimplausible. This odd behaviour by the husband (Colin Farrell) and wife(Nicole Kidman) repeats throughout the film. You find yourselfconstantly asking why would they say or do that? I won't even mentionthe strange sex scenes, although they are tame compared to Lanthimos'ssecond feature Dogtooth. I have watched some strange and wonderful films in my time (Bad BoyBubby is my favourite), unfortunately this is not one of them.
