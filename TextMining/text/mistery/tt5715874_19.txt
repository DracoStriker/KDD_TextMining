Perpetually early for the movies, I stand for a few moments in thecinema hall, overwhelmed with the crowd that forms a (typicallyBritish) queue at the ticket box. It is Halloween and this movie'strailer made it seem like the right choice for a spooky night. There issome kind of buzz in the air when the screening begins. A few momentslater...happy chatter and munching are gone, everyone is focused,trying to figure out what the story-line is all about, what the GBP 12for an adult ticket + GBP 7 for popcorn and coke went for.. a tragedy?No, a roadkill! No amount of expensive equipment can make up for thelack of plot! It just doesn't make sense... at all! Any of it! "But ithad scored so well on IMDb!" - whines someone from the back row and Ican feel their pain... it is everyone's pain... A collaborativeexhaling in short puffs! What.a.waste.of.time! Lights are up as themovie ends... No-one's getting ready to leave - stuck in their seatspeople look around, then look at the screen again, expecting somescenes after the credits to put the whole movie into a differentperspective, making it worth watching at least... To no avail.
