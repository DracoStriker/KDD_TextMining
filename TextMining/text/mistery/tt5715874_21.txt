Yorgos Lanthimos directed The Lobster which is one of my favoritemovies. Lanthimos also directed Dogtooth which is an interesting movie,but it's not as good as The Lobster.I've been on the lookout for what Lanthimos was going to do next. WhenI first saw the trailer for The killing of a Sacred Deer, I wasexcited, and I couldn't wait to see the movie.I've noticed that Lanthimos loves to tell ambiguous stories, I don'tmind it. The Lobster's ambiguous ending was great and so wasDogtooth's, but I think Lanthimos got a little carried away with TheKilling of a Sacred Deer.Nothing makes any sense in this movie. The pacing is slow and I knowthat's the general feel with Lanthimos movies, but this one takes thecake for being one of his most boring and dull films ever.The opening was good and I was interested in the characters because Iwanted to know what was going on, but the movie just kept going, and bythe midpoint, I just didn't care anymore.The only thing that mainly held interest with this dry film was thedirecting. When I looked at some of the shots and angles the directorchose to use, my mind immediately went to Stanley Kubrick's TheShining. This movie is skillfully directed for the most part, and theyreminded me of Kubrick, but also, some of the shots in here did look abit sloppy.I loved Colin Farrell in The Lobster, but in this, he comes off asstale and weird. I'm pretty sure that Lanthimos gave Farrell adirection to go in as a character, but I believe that the direction wasbad, and it seemed like Farrell was reading his lines from a cue cardmost of the time.Nothing is explained here. I don't need to be spoon-fed information,but nothing in this movie makes any sense.This is a pretty pointless movie, all it has going for it is thedirecting, the weirdness, the music, it looks cool, and that's prettymuch it. I'm really disappointed with The Killing of a Sacred Deer.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YxcHUXGnk0
