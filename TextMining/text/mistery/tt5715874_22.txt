It's sick and unreliable. It's not in any way a nice view. After onehour or so, it makes you wish it will soon end. It doesn't. In fact itgoes on and on, getting worse and worse - and it's fascinating andbrilliantly acted by Keoghan, Kidman and Farrell.Yorgos is quite a sick man and I'm not sure what he wants to do.However, 5 days after watching it, it's still growing on me and severalscenes will haunt me for a long time. I'm not sure it's all good, butit does something with me. It leaves marks. Also, it holds the mostauthentic portrayal of medical care and hospital environments I've everseen in a film.Letterboxd: Mårten Larsson (Morten_5).
