Myths were created to help human build and understand the model ofsurrounding world. 'The Killing of Sacred Deer' is too artistic tobother. It builds a dent in reality in which a lower deity (surgeon)accidentally kills father of a greater one. While making people believethat the characters are somewhat real, it combines the mythicalsacrifice of Iphigenia with cliché of train dilemma (kill 3 people byinaction or pull a lever and decide who dies). Unfortunately thesetting is so artificial that the movie completely fails to deliver apoint and decides to abort any attempts of explanation leaving viewersin a limbo. It's gripping, but completely dry upon closer examination. 'The Saw'was more believable than TKoSD. Viewers can admire a glimpse of nakedNicole Kidman for this suffering though!Acting: 7 Plot: 2 Production: 7
