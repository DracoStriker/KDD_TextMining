Yorgos Lanthimos goes for a distinct style that ultimately fails. Onemight perceive it as dark comedy, though the humor in it is more thatwhat is being said is being said at all. We're not laughing with themovie; we're laughing at it. Characters will have asides either withtheir dialogue or with their actions where they do or say something sooutrageous that you can't help but to laugh. Colin Farrell's talk tohis son about an incident involving his father certainly comes to mind.These moments serve no purpose; they do not further the story. Theydon't really add to our understanding of the characters. All it is isfluff. It's extra baggage that, for whatever reason, Lanthimos thoughtwould be necessary or funny, and it's not at all. The film is litteredwith these asides, and all it did was dilute a rather interestingstory. Buried under all of this extra sh*t is a story that could havemade for a fascinating and riveting thriller. But instead, all we haveis an interesting concept wasted by a writer who doesn't know how tostick to the basics of screen writing. It's amazing that I'm sayingthis about an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, but I don't know how elseto put it. Every line of dialogue, every single character, and everyscene of a movie should be solely in service to pushing the storyforward, and this movie is filled with dialogue, characters, and scenesthat only stagnate and offer nothing to the overall narrative...
