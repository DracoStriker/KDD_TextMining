The Killing of a Sacred Deer leads you into a clinical, despairingspiral of revenge, dark humour and banality, releasing you only at thevery end with an inhuman conclusion.We open with open-heart surgery gone awry, then two doctors discussingtheir watches as they throw away their bloodied gloves. Steven Murphy(Colin Farrell) is the heart surgeon in question, who befriends thedarkly enticing Martin, a local youth. We're not sure who Martin is,but it becomes clear he has a stake in Steven's family, including hisophthalmologist wife Anna and especially their children Bob and Kim.Martin and Steven meet frequently, and as Martin is enteringadolescence he has all sorts of questions on adulthood. Kim, herself,is blooming and falls for the quirky Martin, before her brother Bob isstruck by lower-body paralysis. Kim meets the same fate. What's goingon? It seems to be psychological, but we get a dark hint as Kim is saidto have delivered a great lecture on the myth of Iphigenia, and thismyth is made life.Steven, being incurably logical and earth-based, cannot fathom that thefates are involved in a spiral of revenge that will force him to makean unearthly choice. How he arrives to that choice and the ensuing backand forth between he, Martin and his family are fine moments to watchand absorb. Especially funny is a conversation between Kim and Bobabout Bob's possessions, which will leave some in stitches.Highly recommended for those looking for that dark, cold movie that canwork your cockles. General Anaesthesia never looked so different aswell.
