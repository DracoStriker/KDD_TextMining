Creeping, frightening and altogether clinical and cold, YorgosLanthimos' revenge thriller about a surgeon whose family is suddenlyconfronted by a peculiar but utterly vindictive teenager will slitherinto your consciousness in a serpentine and occasionally unsavory way.There are times when this film might feel like an endurance test, butit's worthwhile in the end, because it's such a beautifully acted andvividly directed work of cinema.Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman are excellent as the husband and wifephysicians whose lush suburban lifestyle initially looks insular andbeyond disturbance. But the real standout in this film is BarryKeoghan, who gives a malevolent performance as the nonchalant teenagerwhose father was a patient of Farrell's character. Initially, hispresence seems merely peculiar and offbeat. But as the boy encroachesmore on the family's life, the story takes on a more unsettling tone.Lanthimos' use of deadpan, nondescript dialogue masks somethingsinister and roiling underneath and the whole cast plays itexquisitely. And while this is not quite the black comedy that somehave categorized it as, there are discreet moments of depraved humor.The film has a soundtrack that is classical and mournful but graduallybecomes more violent and disquieting as it dots the storyline withdread and despair. As the sense of hopelessness starts to build up, thefilm ever so briefly becomes a touch static. This brief lapse isforgotten as the climax draws near. What I thought would end with shockand perhaps ambiguity, ends instead with a sense of relief and almostmoral victory. It's as if after putting us through this labyrinth ofhorror and torment, Lanthimos gift-wraps it with a bow. It's a devilishtouch. I first got acquainted with his filmmaking style with "TheLobster", a film that I reluctantly acknowledged as a good work. Here,he surpasses that achievement with someone much closer to the bone anddeathly scary. Recommended to the highest degree.
