"It's the only thing I can think of that is close to justice." Martin(Barry Keoghan)Justice, aka revenge, is just one of the motifs in this black,absurdist comedy called The Killing of the Sacred Deer. A wealthyfamily of two doctors is invaded by 16 year old Martin with thatrevenge on his mind. If you keep Euripedes' Iphigenia in Aulis in mind,where Agamemnon deals with Artemis over killing killed her sacred deerand her demand that he sacrifice a daughter, you'll get an idea of theGreek tragic overcast to the decidedly dark humor.This is not a slasher movie with excessive blood and barely observablemotives. Although the disturbing close up opening of a heart surgeryhints at bloody business to come, minds move the plot, from theaforementioned vengeance to emotionless living where the beautiful homeis as clinically sterile as the hospital in which the two children mustspend time for psychosomatic or occult reasons.For sure, however, is that the two children are made immobile by theforce of Martin's will, in a standoff with emotionally remote surgeondad, Steven (Colin Farrell), over Martin's obsession with Steven'sbungling his father's operation, causing his death.While Martin blackmails Steven with the most heinous condition fordeliverance, we are treated to Kubrick-like long shots down antisepticcorridors to distance us from the horror of this doomed family's life.Even their language is stiff and formal, measured out slowly as if in abad Puritan-colonial drama. Such careless distancing leaves everyoneoff center, the better to show the class divide, the degradation of thewealthy, and the baseness of the underclass that lies underneath theveneer. All of this is comical when considering the black nature of it, but afeeling that revenge may be necessary is not far beneath the surface.Moreover, payment may be due for a cloistered, affectless life. Asusual in a surreal dissection of privileged complacency, the hollowhouse, an emasculating masturbation motif, and emotional negligencework together to undermine the surface happiness of wealth and power.The theme of an outsider invading a home and changing things is givenextra force with an absurd overlay. Maybe absurdists like SamuelBeckett and director Yorgos Lanthimos are better than the realists andwe critics in exploring the terror of living.
