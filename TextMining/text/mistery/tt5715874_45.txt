If you're a fan of The Lobster then you'll probably love this. I'm notso when into this with reservations. My wife and I hated it. At the endof the movie we looked at each other and said "what was that allabout". As far as I can see the movie had no point and to have youractors be as stilted and wooden as they possibly could be really madeit worse. Yes I know it was a revenge story but the characters were soboring it made it a real slog to get through. As I said to my wifewhile I usually like to adhere to the 3 strikes and you're out in thiscase 2 is more than enough to keep me from ever seeing one if hismovies again regardless of how many critics think it's wonderful.
