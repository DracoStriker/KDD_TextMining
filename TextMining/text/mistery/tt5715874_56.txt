I went to see this movie with a couple of friends at a specialscreening, we are all fans of Lanthimos previous works, but when thismovie ended we looked at each other and chuckled nervously indisappointment. A few people in the audience even left immediatelyafter the end and one man a few minutes later gave the movie an ironicclap, people laughed. It was that bad.The movie starts out really strongly, with all the daily awkwardness inhuman interactions Lanthimos can so easily portray and reshape. There'smystery, intrigue, the characters develop as the movie progresses, itdelves into wider themes: the nuclear family, growing up, sexualawakenings and revenge. It is obvious Lanthimos sought to portray a"what if" situation in the movie that would make the viewer reflect onthis themes, but the plot construction and thriller-like soundtrack andfilming leaves the viewer demanding answers (like you normally get inthe end of a thriller) or a twist. Instead the movie goes bland, it'sextremely anticlimactic to the point of being comparable to bad horrormovies where the intrigue goes nowhere. A lack of answers to basic questions as to the function of Lanthimosuniverses is usual in his movies, but here it doesn't work: this isn'ta dystopian family or society, the movie is set in a world that feelslike our own, yet we aren't given any explanations for the surrealundertones this world can have.
