This was without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen.Hollywood has nothing to offer. I'm not going to bore you with a longreview because there's nothing to review. This movie was vomit. Oneshould burn their money before going to see this pile of crap! NicoleKidman needs a facelift for her facelift.
