This has to be one of the weirdest movies I have seen in quite a while.Based on "Iphigenia in Aulis", the acting is excellent yet the plot andthe ending is rather bizarre. The story revolves around teen agedMartin who puts a mysterious curse on the Murphy family because anapparent mistake the Murphy patriarch, a surgeon, made earlier onMartin's father who died during surgery.All the characters' behavior in the story is odd and frequentlyunbelievable.
