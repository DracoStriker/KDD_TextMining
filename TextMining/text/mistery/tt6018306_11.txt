From the trailer it looks like the pitch was something to the effectof, "We want to make the most depressing film this decade." This willrake in hundreds of dollars. I kind of understand the "We're makingthis for the art, " approach, but it seems insane to plan to losemoney. Especially, when next to no one will watch it. Even the coloringis depressing - which I am sure is not an accident.
