I just saw this in a packed theater at the SCAD Savannah Film Fest andliked it even better than I thought I would. It's a great buddy filmthat isn't full of gross out gags and appeals to both sexes because itis so funny with dramatic/touching moments. The cast is great (asexpected) but so is the writing and directing. Definitely a film forgrownups of all generations.
