Everything about it seems to scream doing it for the money. It does nothave the same focus or gusto that the original movie had. Bad Moms wasabout something while Bad Moms Christmas was all fluff. You would thinkadding a new set of moms to it would create some a new depth ofproblems that need to be resolved with another don't give a craprevolution processing because of it, but that's not what happen. Therevolution of moms taking back Christmas was weak and that's where thelaughs come from in the Bad Moms franchise. Bad moms Christmas has afew laughs but not enough to rush out and see it.It's too bad, because I really like what Bad Moms was doing and Iwanted to see that continue in Bad Moms Christmas but it fall flat ofbeing anything worth wild.http://cinemagardens.com
