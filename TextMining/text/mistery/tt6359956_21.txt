If you've seen Bad Moms, you'll remember it to be a mediocre effortwith a few laughs here and there. Well that film not only gets asequel, but one that is more festive themed. The film came quick and alittle out of nowhere, though I was interested how the film would farewith its holiday theme. I like raunchy holiday films, they can be a lotof fun. Or completely terrible. A Bad Moms Christmas kind of falls inbetween the two. Its not really an improvement over the first but doesenough to be a time killer with a few laughs.Our three lead moms are back but this time its almost time forChristmas and the moms of the moms all drop by. There are characterflaws in all of the mothers. Whether it be abandonment, too muchattachment, or a resounding coldness the moms and their daughters donot see eye to eye. A bit of chaos ensues as the character try to finda way to co-exist and come together for the holidays. That plot summarymust have sounded confusing as hell. Its a rather simple plot though,not overly original but sufficient for what the film offers.The film has crude sexual references but fewer than that of itspredecessor. For an R-rated holiday film its surprisingly tame. Thelaughs don't always come but I do remember laughing at loud twice. Theintroduction of characters played by Susan Sarandon, ChristineBaranski, and Cheryl Hines is a good touch because they provide theaudience engagement and do provide the laughs. The film does not avoidcookie cutter plot resolutions and doesn't really remain creative butits fine.The film isn't going to rank anywhere on the best holiday movies of alltime. You won't remember it in a few days after watching it. It's notreally worth a watch, but if you are a movie pass crusader like me whowatches everything you'll find that the film is somewhat decent andprovides for mild entertainment. I do hope the series rests herebecause I can see a supposed third film run out of steam fast.6/10
