'A BAD MOMS Christmas': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The sequel to the 2016 comedy hit 'BAD MOMS' is a Christmas familycomedy flick. It reunites Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn, intheir overworked mother roles. This time they have to deal with theirown overwhelming mothers, who are visiting for the holidays, while alsotrying to put on the perfect family Christmas. It costars SusanSarandon, Christine Baranski and Cheryl Hines, as the three older moms,while Jay Hernandez also reprises his role from the first movie. It wasonce again written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, and it'sgotten mostly negative reviews from critics (unlike the first film). Itis another hit at the Box Office though. I enjoyed it slightly morethan the original.Amy (Kunis), Kiki (Bell) and Carla (Hahn) are still overworked, andstressed out, especially because it's nearing Christmas time. Theybecome even more overburdened when all of their mothers show up for theholidays; Ruth (Baranski), Sandy (Hines) and Isis (Sarandon). Each oftheir moms is overwhelming, in different ways, which causes excessivechaos once again for the three young mothers. More bonding, of course,also occurs as a result of their new problems.The film is a pretty routine Christmas comedy flick. The humor isdefinitely hit and miss (for me at least) as well, but it is moreconsistently funny than the original (in my opinion). I think largelydue to the addition of the three older mother characters, and all ofthe three veteran actresses give good performances in their roles too(Baranski is especially domineering in her domineering mother role). Ialso think Bell, Kunis and Hahn are more settled into their roles thistime around as well. So overall I'd say this sequel definitelysurpasses the original, at least by a little.
