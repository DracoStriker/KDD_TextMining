This movie had me in TEARS. Look, if you want a real head-scratcher,obviously this is not the movie you want. This movie provided myhusband and I with something invaluable right now: ~2 hours in which wegot to forget about everything else and Just. Laugh. I don't understand the people that went to see this movie with anyother expectation--did these same schmucks give 10-star ratings to TheHangover or what? Regardless, if you're looking for something thathelps you forget about all the crap going on in the world right now, goahead and go see this movie--it was great. If you want to be morallyand emotionally challenged, look for a movie poster where the leadactor looks constipated in the movie poster. And hurry up and get this movie available on iTunes for pre-order. Someof us want it as an option to watch whenever we're feeling down.
