I went to see this movie with a friend. I wish I could have walked outafter the 10th f-bomb. This movie apparently was written by someone whohated their mom and still exists in his/her juvenile state of mind. Itreminded me of the 13 year old children at the pool during the summer,practicing their f-bombs. Don't waste your money.
