It hasn't been that long since the original Bad Moms so it is notlikely you don't know what to expect from a sequel. More bad language,drinking, drugs, and suggestive sex. Actually it is an entertaining nobrainier. Some things are taken to the extreme and feel forced. Thewaxing scene drags with its one long joke.The cast does a good job with the material. Susan Sarandon makes theothers look like they may grow up to be actors.There are just enough laughs to make it through the short run time.It's a Christmas movie that won't still be in theaters at Christmas. Ifyou want to get into the bad holiday spirit see it soon in a theater asit will feel dated when it hits home platforms very soon.
