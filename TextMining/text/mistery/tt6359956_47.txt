I went into this expecting it to be a dumb movie with enough laughs tomake it enjoyable. I was surprised to find that it was actually adecent plot for an off-the-wall, raunchy comedy. The characters wereall 3-dimensional, and completely different. The grandmothers all hadextreme personalities, but in completely different ways. The acting wasexcellent, and the jokes were hilarious.Once I got past the fact that Christine Baranski and Peter Gallaghercouldn't possibly be Mila Kunis's biological parents, I enjoyed everymoment. I'm in shock that people are rating this low and saying it isunwatchable. It's hilarious, and it has a cohesive plot. There's reallynothing to hate so much, unless you can't take the raunchy humour.
