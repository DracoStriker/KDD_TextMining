A BadMoms Christmas directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is wilderthan movie Bad moms. This movie is about bad but fun mom and grandmoms. Mila Kunis as Amy is hardworking, overworked mom with lots oflove for her kids and always on edge around her stylish, rich, lovingmom Ruth ( love Christine Baranski ... Mama Mia/Big Bang Theory).Kathryn Hahn as Carla is foul mouthed but does not care aboutpretensions and maybe genetically inherited her personality from hermom Isis ( wild Susan Sarandon, enjoyed her acting in movie Meddler).Kristen bell as sweet Kiki under the tutelage of Amy and Carla is notvery nice to her mom Sandy ( Cheryl Hines). My favorite scenes are thecounseling sessions by Dr Karl( Wanda Sykes) for Kiki and Sandy. Everydaughter should hear what Dr Karl says. Justin Hartley ( from NBC showThis is Us) as Ty ,a strip dancer,is alright as Carla's passionate ,instant boyfriend. Peter Gallagher as Amy's dad Hank does a good job atbringing peace between mom and daughter. Christmas can be quiet andwithout any expression of love by not giving or receiving gifts butChristmas is great when joy is expressed in decoration, food, givingand receiving gifts. I am glad i saw the movie. Christmas is specialand not like any other day. Ruth's love for Christmas and expression oflove and affection for Christmas is contagious. nicely done.
