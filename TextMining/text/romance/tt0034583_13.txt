Most teenagers don't watch classics I know. But after they've seen thisone, there's no turning back! This is the classic to end all classics(That and Gone With The Wind which rocked! but the ending was a bitunusual.) I had been an Ingrid Bergman fan after watching Gaslight withmy drama class. It was great because I love a good mystery type thing. Casablanca was a bit confusing at first, but I found out in the endthat it has just the right blend of romance, drama, and comedy. Plus,my dad instilled in me a love for all things World War II related.I would recommend this movie for children 15 and older, not becausethere's anything bad, but simply because I don't think younger childrenwould understand it. You guys my age, this is a greatSit-down-and-watch-with-your-girl-on-a-rainy-afternoon type movie, andparents already love it, so everyone's happy.I always say when I write these things that, even though I liked it,you might not. CHeck it out for yourself and form your own opinion.
