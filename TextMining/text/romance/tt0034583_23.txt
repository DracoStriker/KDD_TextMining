What makes Casablanca the greatest?The detail. After Ugate is arrested Rick moves forward and picks up a smallglass that has fallen over. When Sam is playing 'As Time Goes by' and Rick is drinking to forget (thefamous scene) he involuntarily moans from within. He shows the man'sheartbreak - the reactions of emotion running through a body broken by boozeand sorrow.This is acting and film making at it's very finest.The inner decency of Rick is moving as is Ingrid Bergmann's tear filled eyes- but the throat catcher is the singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne'simpassioned 'Vive La France!' This was war time, and the film makes us remember what it was all for.Hollywood should look at the script - how simply it is constructed - andlearn - there is a public worldwide that wants scripts of this quality aboutreal people.
