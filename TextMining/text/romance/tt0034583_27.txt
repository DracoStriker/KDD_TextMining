This is a good movie, maybe even a great one. It is most definitely notone of the best movies ever made. What it is is a perfect example of aspecific style of "Old Hollywood" filmmaking, maybe the best examplethere is. But if that style was the best way to make films, they wouldstill make films like that.That's not to say I don't like this movie. I even understand why somepeople love it. It's a pleasant romantic film with some very iconicmoments. For me, The Marseillaise scene is very powerful. Despite allthat, this film fails to be a great piece of art in the way morechallenging films like Citizen Kane, Persona, and The Passion of Joanof Arc are.And that's because, despite the strong story of the film, it has verylittle to say. Curtiz is not interested in raising any questions, butsimply telling his story and drumming up support for the war. He's alsonot a great director, as the movie's cinematic style is overlytheatrical, without any attempt to use cinematography and editing totell the story. The acting is (as usual) is great from Bergman, andrather cheesy from Bogart.This movie is a classic, there's no denying that. But it's a classicbecause it's simply a good example of a style that is typical of thetime. What is typical is almost never important. If the movie is worthwatching it's only because of the place it holds in American culture.It's place in the overall history and development of film is almostnonexistent.
