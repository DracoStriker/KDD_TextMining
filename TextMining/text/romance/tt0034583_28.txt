It's that kind of cynicism that makes this old-time classic endearing to amodern day audience.  "Casablanca" is a noirish melodrama set against theback-drop of WWII and Europeans fleeing to America by way of French Morocco. What's so refreshing about it, in spite of its classical love triangletheatrics, is that is never places romantic love on a pedestal.  It realizesthat in a world of uncertainty where neutrality is the biggest crime, thereare more noble things than love.  This movie is sited by many critics and viewers alike as one of the topthree greatest films ever made.  It's easy to see why.  It contains probablythe greatest dialogue ever written for the screen. It stars two screen iconsin their greatest roles and a superb supporting cast.  It's directed byCurtiz with a complete lack of pretension.  There's nothing overtly artisticabout it, or any sign that anybody involved was trying too hard. Essentially this was a gathering of classy professionals who set out toaccomplish one thing: make an entertaining film.  In the process, they mighthave made the greatest.  Unlike so many of the other classics of thisperiod, you never have to view it "in context" to appreciate and enjoy it. Rock solid entertainment anchored by smart writing cleverly cast andcompetently directed translates well in any day and age.  Play it again,Sam, and it gets even better As Time Goes By.
