Simply put: the best American film of all time and I ain't kidding. I'veseen it no less than one dozen times and each viewing has a bit more thanthe last.Simply impossible to believe that during the making of it,theoriginal writers, the Epstein Brothers, walked out in disgust and in cameHoward Koch, the author of the famous 1938 Mercury Theater Orson Welles's"War of the Worlds" based on H.G.'s masterpiece. That's right-the Epsteinssaid the film was going nowhere-they took a hike and Bogey and Koch sat downand together completed the script. Even Ingrid Bergman, after shooting wasdone, said she never wanted to be associated with such garbage again. Ohheck, I could write a million words of praise about "Casablanca" but nevercould I impart the true greatness of the film. It's got to be seen to bebelieved. The whole darn thing is engrossing, enchanting,mesmerizing,tough,tender,stirring,nationalistic,anti-Nazi and that's onlythe beginning. "As Time Goes By" is not only one of America's greatest lovesongs but just about the one song most closely associated with any film.Dooley Wilson looks like he's playing it but the truth is that the mandidn't know how to play the piano. But who cares,Miss Ilsa? Want to know howgood is that picture? Ever hear of anyone buying and devouring three booksabout it? I did. (1)"Casablanca" by Richard Anobile,(2) "Casablanca" byHoward Koch and (3)the most definitive work ever written about the film,the402 page tome,"Round Up the Usual Suspects" by Aljean Harmetz which I readtwice. Enough said.
