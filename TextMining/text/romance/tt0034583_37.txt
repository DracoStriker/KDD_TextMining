**Spoiler**  This movie has it all; literally.  The combination of severalfilm genres in its outstanding story make this film one of the best.Thereare alot of visual metaphors and symbolism throughout as well.  Considerthefact that Bogart's character Rick represents the social and militaryisolationism of the US prior to the war and how he changes to makingsacrifices for the good of the cause.  "The lives of 2 human beings don'tadd up to a hill of beans" so he gives her up for the greater good.That'sHollywood telling us that we need to sacrifice in our personal lives inorder to fight for the greater good.  There is so much to say about thisfilm, especially the hidden meanings behind it.  You'll be hard pressed tofind a flaw with this film.  Masterful direction, acting, andstorytelling.*****/*****
