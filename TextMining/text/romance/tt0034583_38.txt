I can't see what to write here, since so many people will be moved by thisfilm and write something about their experience in seeing it, often timeafter time, "As Time Goes By". This is a freeze frame of American war propaganda at its highest point, withan array of America's greatest filmmakers collaborating at the beginning ofWorld War II, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a work that willalways be seen and be honored as the epitome of world film-art that itis.Don't take anything for granted when you watch this movie. It all has to dowith time, place, and character. It's so easy to get embroiled in one or twoof the character's performances that you'll miss half of the film. It's anamazing film to watch multiple times.
