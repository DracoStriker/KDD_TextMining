After who knows how many viewings, the scenes with Claude Rains still arethe most entertaining for me.  Rains would have stolen the movie, if therest of the cast had not been so good.  He has many of the really goodlines.  We have two love triangles in this film.  The classicRick--Ilsa--Victor one and the more interesting Rick--Ilsa--Louis. Thenon-traditional ending is one of the most satisfying in films.  As Louiesays, "Who is Rick?  Why, if I were a woman, and I were not around, I shouldbe in love with Rick".   Just a beautiful friendship.
