Yes! Yes! I agree! Casablanca is an excellent movie. Action, adventure,romance, patriotism--"Play La Marseillaise. Play it", Nazi villains,idealism, and yes comedy--"I'm shocked, shocked to find gambling going oninthis place. Your winnings sir." It is indeed one of the most quotablefilmsever. It seems everyone has a line worth repeating, however Bogey has thebest ones.But what about the music? It was Max Steiner at his best!PS Besides "As Time Goes By" and "La Marseillaise" name at least one othersong either played or sung during the movie. No fair going to thevideo.
