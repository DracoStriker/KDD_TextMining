What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It isone of the best films I've ever seen. Usually when I see a movie thatis as highly regarded as this, I perversely try to not like it. Thisone, however, is impossible to dislike. Peter Lorre gives one of themost memorable performances of his career, even though his screen timeis roughly four minutes. Claude Rains is at his unflappable best, andhas many of the most memorable lines in this film. Humphrey Bogartplays the type of character he does best, the bitter drunk. IngridBergman is absolutely breath-taking, and not in an ugly baby way. Iwould recommend this to anybody.
