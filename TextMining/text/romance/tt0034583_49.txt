I was thoroughly excited to see this movie because of all the positivereviews I've heard about it in the past. However, this movie in no waylives up to the hype. Everyone hails it as an undisputed masterpiece,but compared to the many movies that have come out after and evenbefore it, this movie doesn't stand strong. The acting was stale, thecharacters were un-relatable, and the story was drug out too long. Ifound myself bored throughout at least 80% of it. Please don't assumethat I don't like it just because it's an older film; most movies Ihave scene are older films, and a lot of them are far better than thisone. Believe me, I wanted to love this film, but I just couldn't. Evenif it was "great" for its time, that doesn't mean that it's great forthis time. However, I will say that there were a few memorable lines,and some parts that were better than the rest, but other than that acliché filled snoozer.
