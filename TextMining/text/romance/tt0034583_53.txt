This movie was truly amazing. I never found myself bored, not even fora second. The underlying dry humor in a lot of the scenes really madethe storyline comical to the viewer (if you understood the humor). Ihave a whole new appreciation for old time movies and Humphrey Bogart.The dialog was perfect, the characters sucked you in so much that attimes I forgot it was just a movie. I also may have been the onlyperson who was thoroughly happy with the unusual ending that in my eyeswasn't predictable. That's the most I can say without giving it away.It had an array of comical and lovable characters that I couldn't helpfinding myself wishing that they'd have a happy ending. Especially Sam,the piano player, although he barely said two words throughout the filmhis charisma and cheerfulness in an otherwise very depressed time madehim so lovable as a character. Rick Blaine was a strong character thatyou couldn't help feeling some sympathy for, but his characterdisplayed selfless and humble qualities that made the movie all thebetter.
