..."Casablanca" stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, a bartender in thepoor 1940s town of Casablanca.  Men and woman are constantly coming throughhere, looking for a ticket to America.  Police Captain Renault (ClaudeRains) occasionally helps them out, but for a price - or the company of abeautiful woman.  One night Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) arrives at Rick'ssaloon, but what surprises Rick is the woman whom Laszlo bring along.  Thewoman is Ilsa Bund (Ingrid Bergman), Laszlo's wife and Blaine's formerflame.  Ilsa's sudden appearance sends Blaine's new, well structured lifeinto a swirl towards oblivion.Every actor plays their part perfectly.  Bogart delivers a cool and cleverperformance as Blaine, with memorable lines like "I stick my neck out fornobody" he creates one of the most memorable and likable movie characters ofall time.  Rains delivers a fun (and hilarious) performance too as thecorrupt police captain.  He flirts and makes illegal deals, all the whilekeeping his smug grin and witty charm.I wouldn't call "Casablanca" the best movie ever made, but it certainly isthe best (and most realistic) love story that's ever been put on screen. The music, people, and even the town of Casablanca is beautiful.And so is "Casablanca", 8.5/10.
