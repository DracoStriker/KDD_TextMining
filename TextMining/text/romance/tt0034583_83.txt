Some have commented that movies like "American Beauty" or "Fight Club"should be listed above this on the AFI list of movies.  I loved boththosefilms but there is no way you can compare a modern Babbitt (sad andpitifulas he is) or some post-modern fantasizing about how to get out of yourcredit-card bill with someone giving up Ingrid Bergman (!) and thecoolestjob in the world to go fight Nazis in the desert.I think loving this film is a matter of wanting to see a universality onfilm that speaks to the better angels of our nature, not just the prettydecent ones, but qualities of honor that are hard to find in modern film.Also Bogie Kicks *ss. And the Love Story is de-voon.I remember when I made my best friend watch it (we were 15 and I'dalreadyseen it a dozen times). As Louis and Rick walk away and the music comesupshe smacked me and yelled "He lets her leave?? HOW could you let me watchthis and he let's her LEAVE?!"The movie is poetry.  Plain and simple.and remember: there are vultures, vultures everywhere.
