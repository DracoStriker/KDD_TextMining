okay, so everyone i've ever known has said what an amazing movie thisis. it's a classic. it's got fantastic actors (travolta, channing,newton-john, yadda yadda). well, i've seen many a film and i try to stay pretty open-minded. but god almighty, this film is deplorable. this is the worst film i have ever seen. my sister and i tried watchingit a year ago and only got through the first song, but last night, wewatched it all the way through. every. single. goddamn. second. my first complaint is that the characters right off the bat areunrealistic. and you can't tell me that's what the fifties were like.come on, people, no high school looks that old. that guy, sonny, is 32for chrissake. the characters lack depth that makes them likable. well, maybe it wasjust me but i did not find anyone likable except for the lady who ownedthe car repair shop. the film is incredibly sexist, too and what was up with all the rape-esque scene/references? the music was alright, but it seems like the writers just kind of gaveup with lyrics on that last song. the plot was so vague and not in agood way. in an unnecessarily boring way where you realize what thewhole point of the movie is at the end. the girl is giving up hervirginity so a boy will like her. it's a stupid message. it's not atall about love. west side story is far better and natalie wood isn'teven hispanic. i'm sorry if i offended anyone---seriously not my intention. i justdon't see how great this movie is. maybe i missed something but ididn't like any of the characters, they all looked super old and thewhole thing was rather sexist. musically (forgetting the lyrics), it was fine. but, i think to enjoythis movie, one would have to listen to the audio only and try toignore the gang bang comments. or, if you want, just avoid the thingentirely. i wish i had stuck to harold & maude. :((i never give anything this low!)
