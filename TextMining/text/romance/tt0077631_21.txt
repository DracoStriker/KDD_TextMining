The last REAL musical ever made. A timeless film that generations willlove for ever. No other musical made since had can stand up to thistype of quality. Though films such as Moulin Rouge and Chicago havebeen made since they are not the same type of musical as this. Greeseis the last in the same category as the likes of 'On the Town', 'HelloDolly', 'The Sound of Music', 'Kiss me Kate', 'Meet me in St Louis'etc. Grease encapsulates the change between era's of film/TV. This filmwill always remain as one of my all time favourites! Not only does thestory line interest most generations but the music is catchy and helpstell the story. The scenes are spectacular, no film today actually usesentire casts to create a scene, we rely upon computer generated crowdsand copies, and thankfully Grease has none.
