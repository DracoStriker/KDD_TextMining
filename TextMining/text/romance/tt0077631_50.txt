My school is doing a play production of this film, and I must say, itis simply marvelous---one of the best films of the '70s! The singingwas great, and the dance moves were funny and a little difficult topractice doing. I have to admit, I had a TINY crush on John Travoltaduring the film, and I still find myself very attracted to him. He andOlivia Newton-John have perfect chemistry, and I'm so glad that theyended up together. This film teaches a lesson that, if you really lovesomeone, you should be willing to sacrifice everything for them. And Iam a huge believer of true love. For those of you who dislike thisfilm, you have no idea about what you're missing out on. This film is asuccess, and it is all thanks to John Travolta, along with hissuperhuman skills and his incredibly good looks. ;)
