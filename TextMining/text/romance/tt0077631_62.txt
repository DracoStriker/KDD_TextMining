Grease...Wow, what a movie this is.  From the opening credits and theBarryGibb title song, through to the 'hollywood' ending where Travolta andNewtonJohn drive away into the sky, this movie never stops being entertaining.The main cast does well as does the support.  The songs are all wellstagedand enjoyable.  Rydell High is actually a combination of a number ofschools, the outside being Venice High School in Hollywood.   New songswritten especially for the film were, Grease, You're the one that I want,Hopelessly devoted to you and Sandy and compliment the original score ofSummer Nights, Greased Lightnin' etc.  I totally recommend this film toanyone who hasn't yet seen it.
