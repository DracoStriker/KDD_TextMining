The first time I saw this film in its entirety (prior to this I saw themusical number clips on VH1) was at the cinema when it was re-releasedfor its 20th anniversary when I was 11 and in my first year atsecondary school. Re-visiting this film today brought back manymemories, especially my Eisteddfod performance of 'Summer Nights (oneof the best songs)' with my form. Before I saw the film in full, I'dlisten to the film's soundtrack on tape on 'Wet Play' days (playtime inthe classroom on rainy days) with my fellow classmates at primaryschool.There are plenty of positive aspects of this film such as the majorityof musical numbers being memorable (with the exception of There AreWorse Things I Could Do,' Rizzo's second solo performance that Icompletely forgot about), especially 'Grease Is The Word,' 'SummerNights,' 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee,' 'Hopelessly Devoted To You,''Greased Lightning (and the dance to go with it), 'Beauty SchoolDropout,' 'Sandy (my housemate does a brilliant rendition of thisone),' You're The One That I Want (which I also remember from a Shapeyoghurt advert from my childhood) and 'We Go Together (which sounds alittle like all versions of 'The Tide Is High') as well as a version of'La Bamba' being played in the background in the first Frosty Palacescene; the costumes and vehicles that were true to the 1950s setting;the impressive choreography (especially the school dance scene) and theodd funny moment, especially the scene where Jan imitates the beaver inthe toothpaste commercial at the slumber party at Frenchy's house - Icouldn't help myself laughing at that today! I also liked the animatedsegments consisting of the title sequence, toothpaste commercial andthe promotional refreshment animations at the drive-in. After havingwatched the Nostalgia Chick's review of this film, she helped me noticethings I hadn't on previous viewings such as Rizzo feeling like adefective typewriter and her pregnancy rumours, although one thing Inoticed for the first time today was product placement (a Reese'sPeanut Butter Cups billboard ad in the opening sequence and Jan eatinga Twinkie at Frenchy's slumber party). The songs made the film goquickly and they were broken up by the various antics of the T-Birdsand the Pink Ladies whether they were hanging out at Frosty Palace orpartaking in a car chase. I also remember the up-and-down relationshipbetween the two protagonists very fondly.Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable musical that has sheer nostalgicvalue and I'd undoubtedly like to see it time and time again. 10/10.
