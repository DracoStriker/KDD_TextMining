Here comes my love of musicals again! Again another film I've beenwatching since I was a kiddie - probably why I never tire of watchingit! I love it - the colours, the actors, the songs and music.I know every single song and most of the lines. I still to this daycan't quite believe that, that is the same Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)at the end, all dolled up with her permed hair, fag in mouth, piercedears and very tight catsuit (which she apparently had to be sewn into!)You can't help falling in love with Danny (John Travolta) as he isgorgeous, you know, the type of cool good looking guy that every girlwants to go out with.I don't have a favourite actor or actress in this movie because theyare all brilliant. Sorry if I sound like I'm gushing! One thing Ididn't realise till I was an adult was the amount of sexual innuendoand rude comments made. Which proves that it is a film for adults andchildren.I can't stop watching it and it will forever put a smile on my face.
