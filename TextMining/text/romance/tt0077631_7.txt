Since I am still just a teen, I know that many others might say I amnot one to criticize a movie, and in most cases I might disagree, butwith this movie... what is there to criticize? The atmosphere of themovie, the charisma of the actors, the addiction to the awesome songsin it, even the what could have been outdated costumes instantly becamea Halloween fave... I myself dressed up as "new" Sandy when I waslittle... and I still wish I could have been in the movie. I admit, thesequel to it seemed horrible to me after watching the original, and Iwished they had kept all of the original actors, and well, not tried toeven make the sequel, but, well a movie like that can only be made onceI suppose. Anyways, I just want to give my props and admiration to allof the directors, actors, and others who helped with this movie, (beingan ITS member myself and LOVING acting) I think that anyone who has notseen this movie needs to go right to the store and find it....otherwise they really missed out. :)Thanks for reading this, hope youagree!
