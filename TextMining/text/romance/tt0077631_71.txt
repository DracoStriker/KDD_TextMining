I really liked the soundtrack to this movie and was especiallyimpressed with the title song by Barry Gibb. I also liked the classydance routines. The "boy meets girl" story was rather sentimental andcorny but that was all part of the fun of this film.I thought Frenchie, the beauty school dropout, was one of the mostlikable characters. At one point she says "Beauty school sure wasn'twhat I thought it would be" and gets the reply "Nothing ever is." Atthe school dance she says "How do I look?" and her partner replies"like a beautiful blonde pineapple!" Danny and the boys try to be super-cool macho men but their effortsnever quite succeed, especially when the girls are around, which makesfor many comic situations.The climax of the movie comes with the Thunder Road scene...
