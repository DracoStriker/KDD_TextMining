One of the best musicals of all time and most certainly since it wasmade in the late 70's. I watched it in the cinema as a child and havere watched it hundreds of times since, i know children of all ages whocan watch it today for the first time and still have the enthusiasumand enthraulment i had and still have!! There aren't many movies thatcan keep hooking in audiences over several generations and still getthem coming back for more!!! A classic with perfect casting acting anddirecting!! Stockard Channing outshines all with her portrayal of BettyRizzo, a classy, sassy unbeatable performance!! This will always be myfavourite all time film :)
