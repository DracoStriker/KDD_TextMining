Director Randal Kleiser knocks it out of the park with this musical. Personally, I don't find the 1950s era all that interesting. All I'veseen are leather jackets, greasy hair and a superficial gangster typeof attitude with the bad boys.But Kleiser takes all of those elements, which ultimately was writtenby Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey and Allan Carr and Bronte Woodard, and hasa whole bunch of fun with them. That translates real well on thescreen.Also contributing to the fun and energy of GREASE are its maincharacters, portrayed beautifully by John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John,Stockard Channing and Jeff Conaway.The music is fantastic all around. All of the songs seem to capture anera gone by.The choreography is one of the most amazing things about this movie,and it is by the very talented Patricia Birch.
