I've been in love with this movie ever since the first time that I sawit over a decade ago. It was a great classic then, and it's still agreat classic now. I have all of these songs on my Spotify playlist andfor good reason as they never get old. The first song and GreasedLightning are my favorite songs of the show, but it is a hard choicesince all of the songs are amazing.This movie just makes me happy every time I watch it. I love thebeginning scene with Danny and Sandy on the beach. I love how Sandy isintroduced to the pink ladies. I love the ending of the movie and Ilove the sense of humor in the show. Sonny, Frenchy, and Rizzo areamazing supporting characters. No matter how sad I am- this movie putsa smile on my face. If you like musicals and romance movies, you are infor a treat.
