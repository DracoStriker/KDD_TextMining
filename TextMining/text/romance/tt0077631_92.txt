Why does Grease still work after 40 years? Because for every lame"Hopelessly Devoted to You" moment, there's a truly great "You're theOne That I Want" upswing. The plot is all over the place, thecharacters are crazy dumb, and it's not nearly as self-aware as itshould be. Yet the classic earworm songs and the strong humor keep thishomage to musicals-past chugging along.
