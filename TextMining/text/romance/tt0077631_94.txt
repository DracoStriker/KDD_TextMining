In 1978 Hollywood seem to be the best year of produced movies since in1939. Many films in 1978 became templates for their genres that laterother films copied. Films released in 1978 include "Animal House","Magic", "The Boys from Brazil", "Dawn of the Dead", "Superman: TheMovie", "Heaven Can Wait", "Foul Play", "Invasion of the BodySnatchers", "Every Witch Way But Loose" "Halloween" and "Grease". All the above films still are still popular. They all sell millions ofdollars worth of DVD Sales each year. "Grease" of course out sells themall. In case you didn't know the story "Grease" is the story of "Danny andSandy". They are both crazy for each other and yet they are polaropposites. The catchy score has now produced classic tunes. If youmissed out on the original theatrical release that is sad. The film hadsuch a high energy level that you left the movie theater wanting tosing. The major criticism about the film was that "They all looked too old tostill be in high school". Well that is true but I would rather seetalented performers playing roles than untalented age apposite actors. This film is family safe but today the film would be rated PG-13. Thereis some very adult jokes in the film but, it will go over mostchildren's head (and some adults). My complaint about the film is that it has never had a great Blu-release. Yes there has been releases that had "Deleted scenes" but notall of them. There is still plenty of deleted footage that has neverbeen released and I would love to see them. I would also love to see a documentary that explores the making of thefilm. There has been one done and released but it wasn't interesting.
