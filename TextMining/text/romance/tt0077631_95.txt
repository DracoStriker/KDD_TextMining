In my opinion John Travolta (Danny), Olivia Newton-John (Sandy) and thesongs are the ingredients that make this movie great. Besides these,the interpretation of the supporting actors seems rather silly. Thecool looks, the cars, the teenage theme and of course the songstransform this movie into a classic.
