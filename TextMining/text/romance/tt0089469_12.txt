What I loved most about this movie is that it pertains a happy medium.What I mean by this is that, while the effects, sets, and visuals ofthe time were outstanding, the movie was not meant to attract justanyone. It was not a movie that claims familiar sensations and thoughts(except the good vs evil basis), but that branches out into the mostwild reaches of the imagination. This is a 'cult' movie because itsdisplay is fantastic.The themes are simple. Good versus evil, hero and villain, a world offantasy, true love. But what the director accomplished was deeper, moredisturbing, darker, and so much more pleasing to the eyes then youcould expect from a 'fairytale'. Even when the scenes are cheerful andbright, you sense how fragile it is, and how mortal the characters are.And when the scenes are dark and evil, you can not shield your eyes orfeel afraid. You are drawn and can not look away.It was these effects that played with the mind just the way a fantasyshould. You must be left in awe and confusion, and still curious formore.The actors were great (Cruise, unfortunately, being my least favoritechoice, and Tim Curry and the boy who played the Forest Sprite beingthe absolute best). The costumes, makeup, and set are superb.One of my 'must sees' for those who not only love 'cult' movies, butwho love to feel the movie, to be a part of it, and to be leftinspired.
