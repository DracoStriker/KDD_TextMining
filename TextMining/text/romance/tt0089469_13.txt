"Legend" (1985) has to be one of the greatest fantasy films I've everseen. It's better than "Willow" (1988) which I didn't really like thatmuch. Ridley Scott's talent is just mind-blowing. He knows how to makea film from scratch. After seeing Alien, Blade Runner, Black Rain,Gladiator, Black Hawk Down and finally Legend, I've just seen how greatthis guy is with his vision and style of film-making. When I firstheard of the film, I didn't even know Tom Cruise was in it. The scorecomposed by Tangerine Dream fits the film perfectly and helps tell thestory. Ridley Scott's brother, Tony Scott has also made great films:TOP GUN, Beverly Hills Cop II and True Romance. The make-up effects arebrilliant for the time. Tim Curry's reincarnation of Satan is quitedisturbing and he plays a brilliant performance which is unforgettable."Legend" is a film that you can't miss out on so if you see it anywhereon DVD, buy it and you won't regret it.
