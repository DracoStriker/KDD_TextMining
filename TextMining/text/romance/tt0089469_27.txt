The "critics" I have read in the paperback compendia all agree thatthis Ridley Scott opus is a "turkey." Well, maybe commercially and"critic"ally. But not as either cinema or "art." Those self-anointedarbiters are victims of their own prejudices and preconceptions.Because an auteur of Scott's stature is always several jumps ahead oftheir blindered reactions, forget responses. How could the author of"The Duellists" and "Blade Runner" among others NOT be challenging ANDstimulating? Whatever, those critics missed the lush and stunningvistas captured by the camera, not to mention the layered subtextsbehind the visuals. It's gratifying that your lead assessment of thisoutré effort in the fantasy realm is absolutely on the mark. I amsending for the "full" director's? version on DVD from Amazoninstanter, and look forward to re-viewing the purely visual, if nothingelse. And at such bargain prices.
