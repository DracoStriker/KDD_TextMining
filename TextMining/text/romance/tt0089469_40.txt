Tom Cruise, Mia Sara and Tim Curry star in Ridley Scott's 1985 fantasy.Jack (Cruise) is a boy who lives in the forest where his beloved, Lily(Sara) visits him. One day he decides to take her to see 2 unicornsuntil a group of goblins are sent by demonic figure, the Lord ofDarkness (Curry) to capture one of the unicorns so he can turn theworld into a icy, dark void. Lily is also taken and Jack must rescuethem both from him with help from elves & fairies. It becomes a battleof good vs evil and light vs darkness. I've always liked this film andTangerine Dream's score. Curry is amazing as Darkness and Rob Bottin'smake-up effects are terrific as usual. The film has 2 versions plusdifferent scores by Tangerine dream & Jerry Goldsmith which are bothbeautiful. It's one of the best fantasy films I recommend.
