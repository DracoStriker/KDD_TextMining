    Well After three years of reading about the Directors cut for themovie LEGEND, the DVD is out.  Is this even the same movie?  I hadfantasiedabout what the movie might be like with the Jerry Goldsmith score (whichI have owned for a while) and the new cuts, but I did not imagine this.This is what the movie should have been from the day which it wasreleased.ENCHANTING, I thought that LORD OF THE RINGS had become my fav fantasymovie, but not anymore.  I loved the original, and know that alot ofpeopledo not like LEGEND.  PLEASE, do yourself some good and watch thedirector'scut, you will be amazed.
