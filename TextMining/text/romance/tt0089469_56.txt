I love this movie.  This was just before Top Gun that made him a star. Ithought this movie had beautiful scenery, beatiful music, and probably themost basic story(but great one).  Tim Curry and Mia Sara were great too.Ilove this movie too because it was the first fantasy, good versus evilstories before Harry Potter and Lord of The Rings.
