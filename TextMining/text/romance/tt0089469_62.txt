When I first saw this movie I thought "Not bad", but later bought it to addto my movie collection.  I have probably watched it a hundred times.  Theacting isn't all that fantastic, but the story telling is.  The music adds anice mood to the movie.  The goblins are done very well as this movie staysaway from puppets (thank God)  Tim Curry stole the show as Darkness.
