Well, i liked it. I do miss the Tangerine Dream soundtrack, but seeing ashow the 'original' version is included, i think that Goldsmith adding hisinput is A-OK by me. It's not the same, but that's good.The added scenes really make the movie better, and those scenes that areeither re-arranged or restored to their original order are good too ("Niceand sweet, but not nearly as nice as rotten meat"). And i _knew_ that thescene with Meg Mucklebones was cut short - it just seemed too edited andquick. Back in the mid 80's, it was taboo for a film to be over 90 minutes -was it really worth cutting that minute out? I don't thinkso.For what it is worth, i saw this film in the theaters when it was releasedand really enjoyed it back then. I still enjoy it today, but i realize thatit is flawed here and there and could have been a bit more ... 'meatier'.Being an avid Dungeons and Dragons fan, i do like more battle scenes andless fairy tales to my fantasy. But i can't complain.8/10 (both versions)
