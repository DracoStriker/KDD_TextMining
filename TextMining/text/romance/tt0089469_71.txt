Sometimes the biggest names disappoint. Sometimes even the mighty failsto impress. Well, Ridley Scott - the legendary filmmaker, disappointsbig time in his 1985 box office flop 'Legend'.'Legend' is set once in time of unicorns, fairies, goblins, and demons.It's about light and darkness. It's about Good and Evil. It's aboutLove and Hate. Sadly, none it's intentions left me awe-struck. 'Legend'is a body beautiful of minus soul. Having seen the director's cut, thisfilm is amongst the weakest efforts by Scott.Tom Cruise does an okay job. Mia Sara is passable. Tim Curry as theLord of Darkness is wonderfully made, though his performance is hardlya 'Stand Out'.'Legend' has some amazing make-up for it's characters, but scriptwise... blah!
