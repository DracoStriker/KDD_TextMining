Along with Krull and Dune, Legend was one of the worst received filmsof the eighties, but it's not actually a bad movie. Legend chooses avery dark approach to fairy tales and the one mild problem with this isbeing more focused on atmosphere than both story or originality.Beneath all the creative and expensive work from the art department,the story is a gimmick, but if that doesn't bother you, you might enjoyLegend.Jack is a young woods-boy, who must become a hero when The evil lord ofDarkness plans to destroy sunlight so he can rule the world indarkness. He also has his eye Princess Lily, the love of Jack's life.Legend clearly had quite a bit of money. The production offers large,very beautify sets, great make up, and lots of physical effectsincluding, pyrotechnics, smoke and steam, and showers of glitteringsnow and sparkles. Sometimes the film resembles a kiss concert (with abit more plush). There are also, elves, goblins, unicorns, trolls. When we think of Fairy tales we think of light and chirpiness. We donot consider how dark and sinister they can be. On the light side youhave films like, Labyrinth, and The Princess Bride, and on the darkside you have films like Willow and this. In the end Legend becomes, anatmospheric, eerie fantasy, occasionally charming, not terribly exitingor adventurous but kind of amusing.
