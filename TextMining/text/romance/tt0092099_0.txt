I can't believe the reviews I have read about Top Gun being technicallyinaccurate, not enough character development, an overall simple and childishplot... gimme a freegin' break! This film was made to look cool, sound cool,and define cool. Yeah, okay, the MiG-28s are really F-5 Tigers; I've readthe 'goofs' section before. And Tom Cruise's height. And about 'Maverickgoing supersonic - I'll be there in 30 seconds,' and the laws of physicspreventing him from covering 200 or so miles from the carrier in that time.Whatever! So what! If Top Gun had tried to be accurate and true-to-life inevery respect, it would have been some oh-so-serious flick like CourageUnder Fire. Here's some examples of what I mean:1 - what's the best way to evade cannon fire? Do a snazzy barrel roll.Problem solved!2 - the MiG pilots have tinted visors. The good guys don't. Gofigure.2.5 - Russian planes are actually grey or green. The MiG 28s are black. TheTomcats are... yeah, you guessed it... white! Good vs.Evil.3 - Modern air-to-air combat is usually fought at distances of tens of milesbetween aircraft. Top Gun uses much cooler spitting-distance WWI eratactics.4 - "It's too close for missiles. I'm switching to guns!" Enoughsaid.5 - the generic guy carrying coffee who gets knocked over by the fumingair-control officer. We never see him get up. Classic.6 - even the edited TV version is a few steps above normal-cool. "... you'llbe flying a cargo plane [edit]... out of Hong Kong!"7 - the way Iceman says, "Mayday, Mav's in trouble. He's in a flat spin, andheading out to sea."8 - the graceful way Top Gun maintained a PG rating, without using theF-word once.Top Gun came out in 1986. That's 1986. Seventeen years ago. It rockedthen... it rocks now. Just watch it and have some fun.
