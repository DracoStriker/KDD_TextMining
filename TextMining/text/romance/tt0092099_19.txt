Wonderful and just an entertaining movie. Those of us who love aircraftjust like to watch this movie hundreds of times. To watch the main starof the picture, beautiful Grumman F-14A Tomcat is just worth repeatingit at last once a week!! By the way this movie created the fad ofbuilding miniature plastic scale models of the Tomcat. Severalmanufacturers like Monogram and Revell started selling kits like hotcakes and they couldn't keep up with demand. Card models were alsooffered. The Tomcat became an overnight movie star!!! She actedbeautifully, quite natural and showing her beautiful curvaceous linesuncensored!!! Just can't wait to see Top Gun II. And don't miss thesoundtrack, specially "Take my Breath Away".
