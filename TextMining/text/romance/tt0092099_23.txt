If you are into airplanes, or airplane films in general - I don't thinkthis film is for you. Why? It's drama. OK, it's drama with comedy andglory, but it's still drama. You will find no references/jargon totechnicalities of aircraft that are real.As for the film itself, it's art. I can appreciate the film, I'm sureyou could too - Acting's pulled off pretty well, perhaps glorifying theUnited States a bit too much, however.The problem with this film is the fact that in reality, the pilotsgoing up there would be young men risking their life; the fact that inthis film, enthusiasm is so high, really cuts away the realism.However, the battle scenes are full of adrenalin, even for the viewer,and the drama is unpredictable.7/10.
