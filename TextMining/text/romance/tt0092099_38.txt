"Top Gun" is simply one of the dumbest stories ever submitted to film.Themovie lacks each and every characteristic of real entertainment that I canthink of.  The characters are unimaginably dull and dim-witted, the storyistypical war movie crap played as a backdrop to a bunch of typical romanticcrap, and the dialogue is sub-human.  Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis haveabout as much romantic chemistry on screen as Jay and Silent Bob.  None ofthe actors act the way real people act or talk the way real peopletalk.The one thing that really killed me about "Top Gun" was the fact that thecapabilities of its actors were so underestimated by director Tony Scott.Tom Cruise has easily proven himself to be one of the great AmericanActorsof modern times, starring in "Born on the Fourth of July," "JerryMaguire,"and "Magnolia," for which he was awarded the Oscar for Best SupportingActor.  Meg Ryan has proven herself in "Sleepless in Seattle" and "WhenHarry Met Sally. . .," one of the best romantic comedies ever made.  ValKilmer didn't even want to do this movie, and who could blame him?  He'sdone much better work in films like "Heat," "True Romance," and"Tombstone,"in which he played an untouchable Doc Holliday.  These are good actorstrapped in a horrid film.  This is typical, however, of producer JerryBruckheimer, who brought us other cinematic duds such as "Pearl Harbor"and"Armageddon."
