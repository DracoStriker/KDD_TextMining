Well, this was a pretty fun experience, especially after the barragefired by Honest Trailers. "America, f**k yeah!" This is one of the"Cruise" missiles' earlier and harder hits, and it surely pays off. Andlater I played the video game Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X, and it kinda feellike a later modern version of Top Gun. Plus, I find the openingbackground music loop, "Ready Aurora", seriously suitable for theopening sequence of Top Gun, from Paramount logo to debrief back on theCarrier. Honest Trailer fired on the fact that they used Kenny Loggins'Danger Zone three times... well, figure they'll have one less spot tohit if they dubbed the first part with looping Ready Aurora. Too badTom Salsa didn't compose that for Top Gun in 1986, that would have beenepic. I tried that, by the way, and it was good. The story was great aswell, even though the closing scene would look really better with akiss. And Maverick chose to become an instructor in the Top GunAcademy... probably the one(or one of his trainees) that trained DavidCrenshaw, the top pilot from H.A.W.X. This is an enticing thought.
