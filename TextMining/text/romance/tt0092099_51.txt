Great movie about flying, love and friendship. But don't expectreality, it's supposed to by funny, not real, and that's exactly whatyou'll get. I'm a guy looking for fun, life around me is seriousenough, and Top Gun is one of my all time favorites. I might be alittle biased but to me, the story is terrific, very romantic (andcheesy!) at the moments (which I like) and there are some great quotes,so it provides two hours of pure entertainment. Tom Cruise did greatand it launched his career, in my opinion it's his best role. Movie isvisually stunning and soundtrack is good as well. I don't know whatelse to say, it's my first review and I hope it was helpful. Top Gun isa true masterpiece.
