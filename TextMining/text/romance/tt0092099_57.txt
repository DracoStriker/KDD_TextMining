As students at the Navy's elite fighter weapons school compete to bebest in the class, one daring young flyer (Tom Cruise) learns a fewthings from a civilian instructor (Kelly McGillis) that are not taughtin the classroom. "Top Gun" is just one of those must-see 1980s films, very quotable,with a classic cast of Tom Cruise, Anthony Edwards, Meg Ryan and ValKilmer, among others. It spawned the popular parody film "Hot Shots",and remains a hit today despite the fact it focused on a Cold War themethat no longer seems relevant.Both John Carpenter and David Cronenberg allegedly turned down thechance to direct, and we have to wonder how it would have beendifferent. Cronenberg would have brought in a whole new audience,probably reducing the popularity while improving the style.Tony Scott is first and foremost an action director, which makes himideal for this film. The film could have been trimmed a bit by reducingthe stock footage of the military stuff. And it definitely needed areduced use of "Danger Zone" and "Take My Breath Away" (why play thesame songs repeatedly?). But overall, it is a fun, light and ratherexciting film if you are into dogfights.If you have not seen "Top Gun", you really should. It ranks, at leastfor me, as one of Tom Cruise's top three most enjoyable films and isdefinitely at the peak of his career. A good actor he is not, but anessential part of the 1980s he was.
