There is a school of thought that says all movies should be compared on anabsolute scale.  It would say that movies must have a high level ofcredibility or familiarity in order to be "good" movies.  People who fallinto this category simply should not watch Top Gun.  They won't enjoy it.Other people take the opposite, but no more valid approach of looking aeachmovie individually, disregarding all else but the movie.  For these people,no outside reality or credibility is important, because for them, a movieexists to entertain in whatever way it chooses to.  These people wouldenjoyTop Gun very much.  It is extremely doubtful that the producers ever evenconsidered making Top Gun as a portrait of a fighter pilot's life, and thisis why it is entertaining.  It is a rare type of movie, one that no onedares to make today, one that not only transcends reality, but wears it asamask into the world of fantasy.  Everything from the wild dogfights to thefake love to the over the top glamorized (or should I say canonized)characters lets you know that this is a good old American hero drama.  Thatis why it is a horrible and fraudulent portrait of reality, and that is whyI love it.
