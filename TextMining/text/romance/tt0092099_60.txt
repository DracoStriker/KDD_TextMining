It is hard to be too critical of Top Gun because the main purpose ofthe movie is to provide two hours of mindless entertainment, and itsucceeds in that effort. This isn't a simplistic movie masquerading asan insightful one. It is pretty obvious what the aim of all of thoseinvolved in this movie was - to put rear ends in the seats. That beingsaid, I thought there were some nice touches in Top Gun. First, TomCruise, whose acting I have always considered good but not great, isperfect as Maverick. He did cocksure well back then. Second, the KellyMcGillis character, Charlie, is a tough, ambitious woman, and has anatural beauty that is missing from today's pop-tart leading ladies.Back then, directors actually cast leading ladies who looked like womenwe all know and could, gasp, act! Third, it is a perfect time capsuleof the mid 80's, the good, the bad , and the ugly. Whatever you thinkof that decade (I thought the pop culture back then was more fun and alot less mean than it is today) this film captures the rah-rahpatriotism and the growing self-assuredness of America in the Reaganera perfectly. All in all, a good movie that captures a specific eravery well and succeeds in doing exactly what is was intended to do -entertain.
