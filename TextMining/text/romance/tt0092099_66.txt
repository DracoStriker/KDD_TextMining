Top Gun (1986): Dir: Tony Scott / Cast: Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, ValKilmer, Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt: Women love this film for theromance and males love the action. For me, the best aspect is the endcredits that signalled that this overrated dog show was over. It is afilm about being the best you can be but unfortunately the film itselffails to live up to this expectation. Aerial photography and sky actionsequences are overwhelming but story is full of clichés. Two Navypilots compete at the Fighter Weapons School where top honors are knownas Top Guns. Tony Scott is skilled at presenting action. This is astretch from his previous film, a vampire flick called The Hunger. TomCruise has fun as the hotshot pilot whose father was also a fighterpilot who had disappeared. The rest of the cast are reduced to merestereotypes. Kelly McGillis as an instructor is a dumb romantic prop.It comes to no surprise that she falls for Cruise and makes thatimbecilic appearance in the conclusion just to jerk viewers around. ValKilmer plays the ever familiar rival pilot who will come to respecthim. Anthony Edwards plays the best friend who meets a tragic end. TomSkerritt plays a commander who knew the father of the Cruise characterand that is the extent of his role. Too bad the script didn't meettragic end. Potential theme gunned down by corny romantic drivel wherethe top gun is the soundtrack album. Score: 4 ½ / 10
