Is this movie perfect? No. Is it totally accurate? No. But its just adamn fine piece of 80s filmmaking. That being said, the beachvolleyball scene is one of the most unintentionally homo-erotic scenesin film history. But once again, its 80s filmmaking! Just an epic filmthat in my mind is one of the seminal big budget films of the 80s. Iactually know a guy who was an instructor at the real Top Gun and wasan extra in the film. He has no problem with the film, despite itsinaccuracies from a military standpoint, so neither do I.Fun film. If this was 1986 right now, I'd say its a truly great film.But this fired me up when I first saw it like 10 years ago, and itstill fires me up now. Tom Cruise is just...well...Tom Cruise. So muchenthusiasm, so much energy, so much Cruise. Corny greatness.
