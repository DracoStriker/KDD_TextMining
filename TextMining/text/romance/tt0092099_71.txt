this is my favourite movie of all time...call me crazy...i know it's justabasic, fluffy hollywood story that's been done a million times before (andwill be done another million times again)...the acting is not outstandingand the dialogue is real cheesy, but once the dogfighting scenes hit thescreen i forget about all that...the characters are oh so typical, but forsome reason i care about maverick and goose...i know that the movie issupposedly about a gay man coming to terms with his homosexuality, as veryfunnily stated by quentin tarentino in "sleep with me", but i just don'tcare...this movie kicks butt and i love it-
