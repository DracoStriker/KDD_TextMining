Top Gun is, without a doubt, one of the greatest movies to ever grace thescreens during the 1980's. There is not one area where this movie fallsshort of cinematic brilliance. Great acting, although I would've liked tosee someone other than Kelly McGillis, great cinematography, gooddirectingby Tony Scott, and an audibly stunning soundtrack led this movie to beconsidered THE movie of '86. This is one of my personal fave's and reallydeserves a higher rating than it has. Altogether a fabulous display ofmotion picture excellence.
