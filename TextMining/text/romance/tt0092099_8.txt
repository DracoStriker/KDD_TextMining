Top Gun is undoubtedly one of my favourite films, and one of those thathasthe ability to keep enthralling you even while watching for the tenthtime.Director Tony Scott was chosen after the producers saw his work inadvertising, and true to their judgement he has produced a visualmasterpiece. It looks simply gorgeous, and the live action sequences havenever been bettered.If there is one flaw in the film it is that it is somewhat shallow, withallof the people behind the film (and Tom Cruise) rather better at makingvisual spectaculars than an engaging story. However the story does workwellin drawing you into the world of Maverick and his fellow naval aviators,Cruise forms an excellent rapport with Anthony Edwards as Goose, and thedialogue is snappy and eminently quotable. Everyone has at some stage usedMaverick's line - "I couls tell you, but then I'd have to kill you", andthecover of the Righteous Brothers is unforgettable. The film is backed byoneof the best soundtracks of the decade, and a very strong supportingcast.In my opinion, the film succeeds in everything it sets out to achieve. Acracking script, a gripping story, and simply stunning aerial photography.You have to see this film.
