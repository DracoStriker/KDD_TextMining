In 1986 when I was a young boy that began to live near an airforcejetbase, the legend started for me.I met TOP GUN.It's a legend because it'snever been just a movie for me.All the musics, scenes, scripts, and allstuff feels me great and emotional.It's the Spirit of TOP GUN.Despite allthe technical or artistical faults I believe both the movie and thesoundtrack even all other things (especially the others in fact...) are thebests of all times.Still when I remind a part of a scene or a music in TOPGUN, I feel different.I've seen it 50-60 times maybe more, not just themovie, but all filled with spirit of TOP GUN...
