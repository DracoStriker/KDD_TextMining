I first saw Top Gun when I was a High School freshman.After almosttwenty years of viewing it regularly,I could probably write thescript!!!It was a film that clearly defined what is cool in the 80's.It is aboutNavy jet fighter pilots or should I say arrogant Navy jet fighterpilots.It is arrogance personified!!!!Tom Cruise starred as Lt.Pete "Maverick" Mitchell,an extremely cockyNaval aviator who was selected to train in the prestigious Navy schoolcalled Top Gun.It is a school that provides training in dogfightingskills and air combat. The movie has all the elements to make it a great popcorn flick.It is astory about jet fighter pilots who gives a movie a macho feel and makesrock stars out of them.It has romance.It has great rivalry between twoof the best pilots in class namely Maverick and Ice.It talks aboutfriendship among these pilots especially that of Maverick andGoose.There are great memorable lines that is clearly identified withthe film such as "I feel the need,the need for speed" and "Your ego iswriting checks your body cash.Also,there is a mysterious death of themain character Maverick's father.Also,who could forget the dogfightscenes and the aerial photography?And finally,it has great soundtrackespecially with songs such as "Highway to the Dangerzone",whichessentially describes the lifestyle of the pilots and the romantic lovesong "Take my breath away" as well as the instrumental "Top Gun Anthem"gives the movie its MTV feel.This is a feel good movie considering it talks about an jet fighterpilot who later loses his confidence after his friend/co- pilot dies ina dogfighting accident and how he gains it back.This film is foreveryone who feels down.It is a film that helps me personally to gainconfidence in life whenever I feel incapable of overcoming problems andchallenges in life.Watch it and enjoy it.Or why don't you buy the DVD.Watch it to keep your confidence incheck.For we will see these arrogant characters in the movies again.
