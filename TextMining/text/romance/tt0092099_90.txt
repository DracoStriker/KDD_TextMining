Typical Hollywooded, larger-than-life blockbuster from the mid-80s.  Thismovie is a must see for Cruise fans.  One of the best soundtracks of the80s.  Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer, and Tom Skeritt give one of the bestperformances of their careers.  Of course it is not an accurate depictionofTop Gun as some have pointed out .... it is a movie made for pureentertainment value.
