I put off seeing this movie simply because of the title. I figured thatthis was just another chick flick. It's not...I have been told by many that I have to watch this film. I hear peoplethrow out words like, "great", "classic", and "must see". Even my wifesaid to me, "You're a collector, and never seen the 'Princess Bride'?"So, I gave it a shot, and I loved it. I can't put my finger on thereason why though. I must say though, that there's something about thismovie, it grows on you, and I do love it now. Let me tell you a bitabout it:Hard to talk about without giving away spoilers, so forgive me if thereisn't much info here, but I hope this helps you. Let me start by sayingthat this is a great movie to watch whether you're alone, with yourfriends, or even with your girlfriend. There's action, though notintense like say, Bloodsport. There's A TON of comedy. There's a lovestory. A fantastic cast. Sword fights, monsters, poison, dungeons,castle sieges. What more could you ask for? Despite all of thesethings, this is not a very serious film. Which some people like. Forme, it depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a seriousmedieval period piece like "Kingdom of Heaven", sometimes I'm in themood for the opposite, like "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" I would saythat, in terms of seriousness vs spoof, this film is sandwiched exactlybetween "Kingdom of Heaven" and "Men in Tights". Not too spoofy, butnot one that stays with you and keeps you thinking all night either.
