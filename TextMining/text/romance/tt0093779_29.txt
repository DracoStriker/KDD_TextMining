"Stand By Me" director Rob Reiner helmed William Goldman's adaptationof his novel "The Princess Bride" with Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin,Robin Wright, and Peter Falk. This imaginative fairy tale about truelove is often amusing. A girl falls in love with her servant, but hegoes away and is reportedly abducted by pirates. The story is framed byanother story about a grandfather who reads a story to his sickgrandson (Fred Savage) about a king who wants to marry a girl so he canstart a war. Meanwhile, a swordsman (Mandy Patinkin) has spent 20 yearssearching for the six-fingered gent who slew his father. Cary Elwes andRobin Wright at the star-crossed lovers, and Elwes bears a strikingresemblance to Douglas Fairbanks when he dons an outfit in black with amustache. Billy Crystal has a cameo as a miracle worker. Although it isostensibly a fairy tale rated PG, "The Princess Bride" has somegruesome scenes, particularly when sadistic Christopher Guest torturesour hero. Worth watching.
