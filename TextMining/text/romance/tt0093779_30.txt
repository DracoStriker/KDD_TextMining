A boy (Fred Savage) is home sick, and to his dismay, his grandfather(Peter Falk) has come to read him a fairy tale. It's the story of thebeautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls for farmboy "As you wish"Westley (Cary Elwes). He goes off to make his fortune, but after newsof his death, Buttercup is being married off to Prince Humperdinck(Chris Sarandon). Then the princess bride gets kidnapped by threerogues (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, André the Giant).This is possibly the best fairy tale reimagining ever. Peter Falk'sfeign indifference narration sets off the great adventure, and FredSavage has just the best balance. Director Rob Reiner has put togetherall the fairy tale snippets and create something even better. Thecharacters are memorable. And who could forget the fun that WallaceShawn has choosing the poison drink. Mandy Patinkin is absolutelyamazing as the swordsman seeking revenge from the six finger man. Andthere will never be another André the Giant.
