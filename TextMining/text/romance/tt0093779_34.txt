Having just recently sat through Dungeons and Dragons (*shudder*) with mydaughter, I decided that I should show her that there is indeed good in theworld, blew the dust off my VHS copy of The Princess Bride, and settled downto watch it with her.I'm not going to draw a comparison, though. It'd be so unfair, for this filmremains one of the very best I've ever seen. It's beautifully photographedand directed, it's extremely funny, and succeeds captivatingly at poking funat itself too, and it's totally engaging throughout. There's not a weakpiece of acting in there - okay, admittedly we're talking about fairy talestereotypes almost throughout, but even so every performance meshes justperfectly. Cary Elwes (and what *has* happened to his career?) is just idealin his slightly self-mocking role as boyscout meets Errol Flynn, and RobinWright just shines as the Princess - she's possibly the most beautiful womanI've ever sen on film, giving Grace Kelly a real run for her money. ChrisSarandon makes an excellent scheming evil prince, and the comic vignettesfrom the likes of Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn and Mel Smith are a sheerdelight.Fred Savage, who I am no particular fan of, gives a very creditableperformance as the grandson, capturing the truculence of a 9 year oldwithout once becoming annoying, and his relationship with the accomplishedPeter Falk as his grandfather is touchingly and accuratelyobserved.But the whole show is entirely stolen by Mandy Potemkin as Inigo, the banditwith a mission. His role is both a comic tour de force, and poignant too.I'm sure that even in 30 years' time, if I hear the words "Hello, my name isInigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die", I'll start smiling andchuckling at the evoked memory of a movie that is in its genre simply beyondcompare.Oh and my daughter sat simply spellbound through every frame. What morecould you want?
