The Princess Bride has always been the go-to "I want to scream withlaughter" film for my family, and with very good reason. It neverdisappoints! Despite being watched to the point of perfectmemorization, the movie never ceases to tickle my funny bone, and Ialways end up in stitches! The casting is gorgeous, the writing cheeky,the innuendos tasteful, the jokes delightful, and the characterseternally endearing. One cannot complain about the message the filmsends either, that true love is the strongest power in the universe andcan conquer all odds and adversities, even death. My favoritecharacters from the film are undeniably Wesley (of course! he'severyone's favorite) and Inigo. Both are brave, cunning, and willing totake any measure to bring the baddies to justice. (and the fact thatthey're both drop dead gorgeous doesn't hurt either.) Beautifullyportrayed by the gorgeous Carey Elwes and the sweet faced MandyPatinkin, they perfectly frame the movie. Peter Falk is adorable (asalways) as the grandfather/narrator, and Robin Wright is flawless inher performance as butter cup. This film is a must see/must add to yourcollection type of movie, as it is a work of art for the entire familyto love and enjoy. It's timelessness has endured for 30 years, and willcontinue to do so forever more. To the writers, producers, director andactors of the production, well done dear friends; very well done!
