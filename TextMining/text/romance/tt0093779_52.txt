I LOVE this movie from William Goldman's 1973 excellent book convertedinto a movie. A princess who is also a bride to be, how clever is acombination two who employees a farmhand, Westley. The handsome Westleyalways appease his woman with a response: "as you wish" and he revealshis love for her. This movie is every girl (no matter how old) romance.With a happy ending as narrated by a grandfather told to his very illgrandson, it depicts fantasy and the subtle ness of love. I am willingto watch this movie again and again. This movie is a classic thatrivals in the silver screen with 1987's "Dirty Dancing" which both havelove and romance in their respective plots.
