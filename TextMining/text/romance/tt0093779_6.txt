This film is an intelligent, sardonic send up of several genres that pokesfun (affectionately) at fairy tales, swashbucklers, love stories and basicconventions of film.  One of my favorite scenes is where Inigo Montoya firstconfronts his quarry after years of searching.  His adversary does theunexpected-and what most villains in real life WOULD do under the samecircumstances, with hilarious results in the scene.  Basil Rathbone probablywhirled in his grave!Not by any means Citizen Kane (we already have one of those, anyway) but achamp in its weight class, with a perfect score, a fine script and goodperformances.  Far more true to the flavor of the original fairy tales thatit spoofs than even the best of Disney's takes.  I loved it the first time Isaw it and love it more now.  Well worth watching.  Recommended.
