Despite being a fan of director/producer Rob Reiner's classic ComedyThis Is Spinal Tap,and also being mesmerise by his elegant adaptationof Stephen King's short story The Body with Stand By Me,I have oddlyfound myself intensionally staying away from seeing his ComedyAdventure Fantasy film The Princess Bride for a number of years,due tohaving seen a clip of the movie years ago on TV,that didn't connectwith me at all.Checking four days ago to see what was coming out at my local cinemathis week,I was shocked to discover that they were holding a one-offscreening to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The PrincessBride.Shortly after reading about the screening,I began to get a suddenfeeling that something about this film might be pretty special,whichled to me running down to the cinema,to pre-book a ticket so that Icould at last pay my long,overdue visit to what sounded to be a veryspecial princess.The plot:Paying a visit to his ill grandson,the grandfather is sad to discoverthat his ill in bed grandson is not resting,but instead playing VideoGames.Grabbing his grandson's attention for one moment as he enters thebedroom,the grandfather decides to make the most of his opportunity byturning off the TV,and taking a book off the bedroom shelf called ThePrincess Bride that he used to have read to him when he was hisgrandson's age.Hearing objections from his grandson,the grandfathertells him to give the novel a chance,as he begins to read The PrincessBride to him.The Princess Bride:Spending all of her life on a farm,Buttercup enjoys passing the time byriding the horses that she owns,and also lightly teasing a farm boycalled Westley,who replies to Buttercup's teasing with a smile and thewords "As you wish".Warming to Westley, thanks to him always taking herteasing with good grace,Buttercup begins to feel that Westley's wordsof "As you wish",actually mean "I love you",which leads to Buttercupand Westley finally opening up,and falling in love with each other.With neither of them having enough money to afford a wedding,Westleymakes the painful decision to leave Buttercup temporally behind,and goto work on a ship,so that he can gather enough money which will allowhim and Buttercup to have the marriage of their dreams.Promising thathe will return to his beloved soon,Westley's promise soon becomes afading memory,when Buttercup receives news that Westly's ship has beenattacked,and that there are no sign of any survivors.5 years later:Gathering the pilgrims of Florin,Prince Humperdinck announces that onthe upcoming 500th anniversary of the city's creation,he has decided tomark the day by choosing a pilgrim who he can get marriedto:Buttercup.Despite Humperdinck's happiness over the choice of hisfuture wife,Buttercup finds the memories of her first love Westley tohave a strong grip on her,which leads to Buttercup feeling completelyempty over her future marriage.Riding around the woodland area of Florin,Buttercup is stopped in hertracks by three men called Vizzini,Fezzik and Inigo Montoya,who quicklygrab,and kidnap Buttercup.Dragging the still-alive Buttercup's body upthe Cliffs of Insanity,due to them wanting to start a war betweenFlorin and a near by city,by placing Buttercup's dead body in the othercity.The kidnappers suddenly see a strange image which leaves themcompletely in shock,due to the image being of a masked wearing manclimbing the Cliffs of Insanity and quickly catching up to them,withthe strange man looking as if he is willing to do everything possibleto get Buttercup out of the kidnappers hands and off the Cliffs ofInsanity.View on the film:Adapting from his own 1974 novel,William Goldman's amazingly leanscreenplay allows the grandfather and grandson (played by a very goodPeter Falk and Ben Savage) to "interrupt" the unfolding Princess Bridestory taking place,which allows for any moments when the film couldpossibly fall into the clichés of the Fantasy genre,to instead bepaunched by Goldman's subtle comedic hand,which led to everyone in thecinema awing and laughing none stop for this brilliant movie.Bending the worn out and tied roads that have been taken with a "damselin distress" Fairy tale,Goldman superbly shows the enthralling missionsthat the characters face with a perfect seriousness that makes sure theviewer laughs with the characters,and not at them.Along with theFantasy parts to the tale,Goldman also jam-packs the movie withsharp,hilarious Comedy that offers something for all ages.This is thanks to the Comedy going from delightfully silly slap-stick(which wine is poisoned?) and perfectly delivered one-liner's ,("Hello,my name is Inigo Montoya.You killed my father.Prepare todie!.") to even some surprisingly satirical moments (the late PeterCook playing The Impressive Clergyman,and the great line "I've hiredyou to start a war,It's a prestigious line of work,with a long andglorious tradition!.)Revealing an epic eye for scope that he had never shown before,with theIreland and England locations being shown at their full beauty,co-producer/director Rob Reiner strikes the perfect balance of allowingthe locations to create an enchanting,unforgettable atmosphere,whilstalso keeping the movie from flying away by placing all of thecharacters feet firmly on the ground,which allows for the hilariousComedy moments to hit their target every time.Brilliantly complementing the astonishing locations,Reiner never allowsany of the characters to fade into the corner of the screen,but toinstead shine the movie on each of the characters,which helps to makeeach of the characters feel that they are at the very centre of thistruly magical tale.
