The synopsis of this film in the TV guide suggested that this film'starget audience would be young girls; but as I'd heard good thingsabout it I decided to give it a go; I'm glad that I did, as it was alot of fun. The main story is in fact a story within a story; agrandfather, played by Peter 'Columbo' Falk, visits his sick grandsonand reads him a tale about a young woman called Buttercup who isdestined to marry a prince she does not love after her one true love iskilled by the dread Pirate Roberts. Shortly before the wedding she iskidnapped by ruffians who plan to kill her in order to start a war. Asthey take her they find themselves pursued by a masked man in black? aman who claims to be none other than the dread Pirate Roberts! Hemanages to free the girl and when he removes his mask she is shocked tosee who he is. Unfortunately she is soon back in the hands of thedastardly Prince Humperdink. As her wedding day approaches it looks asif nobody will rescue her but this being a fairy tale there is somebodywho wants to free her and he won't let a little something like beingdead stop him! This film is a lot of fun and will probably amuse children and adultsalike although some scenes may disturb younger children. The cast do agood job and it is clear that they were having fun making it; theheroes are suitably heroic and the villains suitably villainous. Whilesome of the scenery and special effects looked less than convincing bytoday's standards that only adding to the charm and giving it a feel ofswashbuckling films made in the sixties. I'd certainly watch this filmif you get the chance and you don't have to be young or a girl to thinkit is great.
