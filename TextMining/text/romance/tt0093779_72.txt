A good friend of mine loves this movie and convinced me to watch it. Itwas a very sweet, fun fairy tale kind of movie and I very much likedhow the movie was made(the story being read to a curious child by hisgrandfather).This is very much a feel good fairy tale type of movie in the form ofEver After and The three musketeers. It's also a very sweet story withthe standard "love conquers all" type of message but you believe it inthe story of Buttercup and Westley.I thought Mandy Patinkin was particularly good as the fierce yetinherently decent Inigo Montoya. And of coarse there's Cary Elwes formany a girl to swoon over-did anyone else notice how much of aresemblance he has to Brad Pitt?My only negative, is a scene or two were surprisingly violent for thistype of movie and people not expecting that maybe in for a surprise.But that is my only strong negative.All in all a very sweet feel good movie that's well above average andis definitely worth checking out. My vote is 8 of 10.
