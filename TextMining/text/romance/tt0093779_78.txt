It doesn't suffice to call "The Princess Bride" a fairy tale; thismovie is a surprise every step of the way. Here's how we might describeit: "All in the Family"'s Meathead directs an epic tale of Columboreading his grandson a story of Forrest Gump's girlfriend in love withthe slimy guy from "Twister"; the "Fright Night" vampire and one of the"Spinal Tap" guys hire a wrestler, the "Ragtime" salesman, and the guywho had dinner with Andre to kidnap the woman; one of the "CitySlickers" also plays a role.Okay, that's a silly description. But my point is, this movie is likenothing that you've ever seen. With ROUS and various politicalreferences, the whole thing is a mile a minute. The cast couldn't havebeen more impressive: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Chris Sarandon,Christopher Guest, Andre the Giant, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn,Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, Peter Falk and Fred Savage.And some of the lines? Let me just put it like this: if you don't comeaway from this movie occasionally uttering "Inconceivable!" and "Myname is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!", then youmust be numb.I quite literally can't find anything bad to say about "The PrincessBride". Always emphasizing teamwork and intellect over brute force, andnever degenerating into sappy love, it may be THE perfect fairy tale.As everyone wishes.
