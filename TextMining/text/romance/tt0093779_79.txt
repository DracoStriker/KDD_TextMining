This movie has a grandfather reading to his grandson, and we get to see thestory he is reading unfold before our eyes.  Rather good movie thatentertains in so many ways.  The cast is excellent, even Andre the Giant isvery good in this one.  Turns out he is the only wrestler that can act.  Thestory is fast moving and has some nice twists and surprises along the way,they surprised me the first time I saw this one (I won't give anything awaythough).  What made this film good for me though was that it contained quitea lot of humor and it really worked well.  I loved Cary Elwes delivery andPatinkin was also very good in his role too.  Billy Crystal and Carol Kanealso make memorable appearances in this one.  Though one of my favoritescenes has to be when Cary's character has a battle of wits with the oneguy.  One of the funnier scenes I found in this one.  There are also niceset designs like in the fire swamp.  The periodic interruptions also work,as they never let you forget that it is a simple story being read by agrandfather.  Good movie all around and fun to watch.
