Both the "Princess" and her true-love are too pretty for words andcould have been "drawn" by Walt Disney! That being said, a triumph forDirector Rob Reiner and the supporting characters. Wallace Shawn isannoyingly funny and I would have poisoned him myself. Andre The Giantis terrific and I can't imagine anyone else in his role. He speaks witha pronounced accent and his dialog is hard-to-understand at times!Billy Crystal and Carol Kane probably would look that old today, but 30years ago it required aging makeup. Like all movies of this type, thereare memorable scenes that combine to make a classic movie. Fred Savageand Peter Falk are wonderful together as Grandfather and Grandson. Thestorybook plot keeps changing to accommodate the boy's "wishes". Itmust have a fairy tale ending! In truth, Andre's pituitary "Giantism"condition left him rather weak as he aged. Everyone was pulled up themountain by cables. Everything is as it should be as the villains turnout to be evil, vile liars. Just remember that (according to "MiracleMax"), there is a big difference between almost dead and completelydead. Also, nothing beats a good MLT sandwich if the meat is lean andthinly sliced! Never in my life have I heard so much dialog duringsword fights! Other funny "touches" include: a mumbling minister. (Ishe the same "minister" used in "Spaceballs"?) Also, instead of a fierydragon, the "perilous dark forest" has a man and woman-eatingmonstrous-sized rat and a hidden torture chamber in a tree! Great fun.PG-13 at-the-time but probably PG by today's standards.
