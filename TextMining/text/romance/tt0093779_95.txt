Only just discovered this movie now and its claimed a place near thetop of my comedy list. It provides laughs throughout with the samewonderful silliness of Monty Python which also makes it endlesslyquotable. I might've dismissed this film as a children's fairytale/romance but it is nothing of the sort. You won't be disappointed!
