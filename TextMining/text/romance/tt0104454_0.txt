If it's raining, if it's late, if I'm tired of working, if I'm restlessor if I'm in a quandary of sorts, "Howard's End". I put the film on andEmma Thompson - presumably with the help of her accomplices, Ivory,Jhavhala, Hopkins etc - takes me away from whatever mood I'm trying toescape and leads me through her own, brilliantly drawn, gentlytorturous path. I don't recall when was the last time an actress hashad this kind of power over my own psyche. The film is constructed withan Ivory attention to detail worthy of a vintage Visconti. Thescreenplay has no lapses of any kind and never falls into the usualtraps. Loyal to its source material and yet, cinematic in the mostrevolutionary traditional sense of the word. The Britishness of AnthonyHopkins character is turned upside down giving us a glimpse into acharacter that's a mass of contradictions. But it is Emma Thompson'sfilm from beginning to end. What a glorious achievement.
