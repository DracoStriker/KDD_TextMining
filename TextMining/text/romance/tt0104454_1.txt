The literary period piece is a difficult genre to master, requiring adifficult balancing between restraint and flowing emotion.  Few filmseffectively achieve this as beautifully as  Merchant-Ivory's astoundingHOWARDS END, making it probably the best period film of the 1990's.  Thefilm juxtapositions the intellectual, emotionally unhindered Schlegelsisters against the restrained, imperious Wilcox family, and, for goodmeasure, mixes in the differing attitudes toward class emerging early in thecentury.  What could quite easily have been a dry study in the culturaldynamics of pre-WWI England becomes an enveloping tale, thanks in no smallpart to the performances by Hopkins, Emma Thompson, and Vanessa Redgrave,whose Ruth Wilcox remains enigmatic after every viewing.  The emotionsringing through by film's end - not to mention its astoundingly pointedsocial criticism - give the film its power, a power missing even fromForster's rambling, distant novel.  And this story is nestled amongst someof the most beautiful art direction, music, and cinematography to ever gracethe screen.  The haunting journey to HOWARDS END is one few other recentfilms can rival.
