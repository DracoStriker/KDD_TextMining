By the end of this movie, you feel as if the characters are part ofyour family. You want to know more about them, and what happens tothem, and to the wonderful old estate of "Howards End". Every time Iwatch it, I find new details that escaped my notice before.The first version I saw of this movie had Henry, Anthony Hopkins'character, on the verge of asking Margaret, Emma Thompson's character,to be his mistress. This would have, in the morals of the time,required an end to the relationship. In her quick-witted way, sheresponded, "Yes!!", and he asked, "Yes, to what?" She said, "You wereabout to ask me to marry you. I said, yes, I will!" This was changed insubsequent versions and I think it made for less understanding of thedynamics of the characters.The English family who don't realize that the are dinosaurs, in effect.The social norms which allowed them privilege are crumbling. We hearRuth saying she is personally glad that women don't have the vote tothe astonishment of the younger women. This leads you to wonder whetherthis was really her own thought, or whether Henry was so overbearingthat she was never able to think for herself. Another instance is whenCharles, after he has caused the death of Bast, blithely assuming hewill only be the star witness in the case because he thinks his socialstanding will protect him.The German family are more adventurous, inquisitive, and adaptable. Inone bedroom scene, Margaret is shown reading "Theosophy", and Henry,turning to a picture in the book, says, "And what is this?" When Tibbyadmits to Charles that Bast is the father of Helen's child, he has noidea that Charles will charge forth to defend the family honor with asword as in days of old.To me, the name of the estate of "Howards End" is symbolic of of theend of the family as well as the era.This is a visual treat as well as an intellectual adventure.
