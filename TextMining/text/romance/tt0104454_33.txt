I have heard many people complain how boring or monotonous "HowardsEnd" is(look at some of the other user comments). The first time Iwatched it, I was inclined to concur, though only in regards to thefirst hour. However I eventually got around to reading the book, anddecided to view the movie again.I now found that none of it could be described as boring. The possiblereason for this may be choices made by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and JamesIvory regarding the visual representation of Forster's language andideals, in ways which make the film and book differ, but enhance thescreen drama(ie. having the Beethoven concert be a lecture on "Musicand Meaning", and the extended scene of Helen Schlegal and Leonard Baston the lake). This, combined with lovely art direction and costumingand the brilliant cast(particular credit to Emma Thompson as MargaretSchlegal, who serves as the moral and intellectual center of thestory)makes the Merchant Ivory production of "Howards End" excellent.
