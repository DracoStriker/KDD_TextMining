I have just seen "Howard's End," and I think that it is probably the bestMerchant-Ivory film they ever collaborated on. Emma Thompson's performance,like Anthony Hopkins' and Helena Bonham-Carter's, is luminous and scary inits perfection. The characters, sets, costumes, screenplay, and everythingelse are provocative, beautiful, and very interesting. The pace is smoothand well-done, and by the end the viewer is very satisfied. This was thebest film of 1992.
