Movie about class distinction in 1910 England. Fairly poor MargaretSchlegel (Emma Thompson) befriends elderly Ruth Wilcox (VanessaRedgrave) who leaves her Howard's End, a country estate. The Wilcoxes'ignore the request and Shlegel never knows about it...but Mr. Wilcox(Anthony Hopkins) falls in love with her.It's hard to really summarize the story--so much happens. Let's get thenegatives out of the way first--this is far too long (140 minutes) andthere were parts where I was getting bored; there are lots ofunexplained bits and pieces (especially towards the end) and I neverunderstood WHY Hopkins wanted to marry Thompson. It seems there's aulterior motive we're not made aware of. Still this is well worthcatching.It's beautifully filmed--there is some truly stunning set decorationshere--it was a deserved Oscar winner for Best Set and Art Direction.Also it has an intelligent, literate script which also won BestScreenplay. Thompson won Best Actress too. Actually ALL the acting hereis great--Thompson is easily the best but Helena Bonham Carter matchesher as her fiery sister and Redgrave gives in a very delicate,mesmerizing performance. Hopkins is also great especially when you seethe evil hiding behind his outwardly gentle facade.Great acting, beautiful sets, intelligent script--what more could youask for? Try to see it in a theatre--TV doesn't really do this onejustice. I give it a 9
