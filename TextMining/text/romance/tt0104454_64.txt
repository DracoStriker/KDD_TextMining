I've seen this movie about 10 times and every time I learn something newabout the characters and the plot.  This film is certainly a characterstudyand Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson are extraordinary.  They portraytheircharacters perfectly with subtlety and grace.  I can imagine it takespatience and a long attention span to absorb this film and I don'trecommendit for everyone.  The last line in the film is so poignant and I can'tpossibly say enough about this movie.
