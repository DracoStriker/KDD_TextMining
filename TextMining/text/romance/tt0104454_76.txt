I for one am not too fond of the costume drama genre, I'd often findthose movies rather boring and pointless, and I am not a sucker forcostumes or art decoration on any account, so I don't find much comfortin that.But once every while a good one pops up: and Howards End is one ofthem. James Ivory (who would make the excellent Remains of the Day thenext year), has taken the novell by E.M. Forster to the screen verywell and is helped a great deal by his fantastic cast: Redgrave (whowas nominated for an academy award) and Thompson (who actually baggedit) in particular are impeccable.The ending may seem a bit sudden and overblown, but what's left is afascinating story, well directed and perfectly acted. You can do a lotworse...7/10.
