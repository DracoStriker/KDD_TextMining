Call me a daft American if you wish, but I was totally unimpressed withHowards End.  What I liked: All the performances are rich and lovely,especialy Emma Thompson.  The film is beautiful to look at, the lavishcountry sides and the marvelous wardrobes.  What I didn't like: the story,the length of the film, etc.  I'm sorry folks, but I just didn't get thesignificance of Howards End.
