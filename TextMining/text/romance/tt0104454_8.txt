This film is a testimony to the creative novelist E.M. Forster!  This early90's  full-length version of the novel is faithful to his 1921 masterpieceand beautifully realized by a team of film makers who know the "rightmoves."  What a great trip back to early 20th Century Britain.  The filmmoves briskly but in some ways we're experiencing some time gaps in a slow,slow manner; the outdoor scenes are great and almost multi-sensory.  Thishighly atmospheric film also includes a great ensemble cast headed by EmmaThompson.  The film never underestimates the intelligence of the audienceand forces us to confront even our own class discriminations!  Well worth aVHS or DVD rental; sorry I can't give any comments on DVD extras as Iborrowed this free from our local library.  Keep a copy of the book handyand notice the masterful interweaving done by Ruth Prawar Jandhlava.  Lifewhen fully realized is about much more than consumerist illusions and brief"ownership" by a selfish few. The novel's Motto is "Only connect" and thehard-thinking viewer of this great film will be enabled to do that as well!!!
