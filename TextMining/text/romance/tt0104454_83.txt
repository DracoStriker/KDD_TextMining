Spoilers herein.A film about a book about books and bookishness.A film with excellent actors, all warmly competent and no one taking anyrisks.A film with Branaugh's current and future lovers, trapped in a clash ofethics, morality and passion.A film that satisfies without nourishing. Painterly but withoutart.But what interests me: it is a drama centered in the sense of place,revolving around a specific building. Many of the best films deal witharchitecture cinematically. But this one missing a rare opportunity -- thiscast with a better crew, one more aware of how film works -- could have donesomething important, life-altering. But alas, not thistime.See for example the risks Helena takes in `Fight  Club.' That both West andThompson take in `Carrington,' a similar enterprise
