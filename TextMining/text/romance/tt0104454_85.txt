This is the most well-acted, well-directed, and well-scripted movie I haveever seen.  The nuances of every character, no matter how minor, unfoldbeautifully, in a symphony of pure artistry personified.  This is theultimate thinking person's movie -- the type that Hollywood continues toinsist we are all too dumb to appreciate while they go on making Die Hard75.  If you treasure originality of thought and great acting, this film isdefinitely a must-see.
