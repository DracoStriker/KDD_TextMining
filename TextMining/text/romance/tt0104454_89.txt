Lavish sets, gorgeous scenery, top notch acting, and flawless props andcostumes couldn't make this anything but a confusing tale of upper crustBritish snobbery vs. the downtrodden lesser mortals. To me this picturewasdull and torpid because it seemed to merely meander about the lives of 3families whose lives intersect at various times leading to desultorydialogue and much yawning from the audience. Bloody awful.
