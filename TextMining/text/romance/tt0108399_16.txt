Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made.Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too doesPatricia Arquette as Alabama. Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater& Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late JamesGandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to thismasterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer,who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the Kinghimself, Elvis Presley. I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that hasnot seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swearthat you will not regret it. Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been.
