Loved this movie from the first time I saw it back in 1993. Recentlyrevisited it and found it just as engaging and clever 22 years later.This remains one of Tarantino's best scripts, equaling and eventrumping some of his more celebrated work. The ensemble cast here is priceless. Maestros like Walken and Hopper inthe now classic Sicilian scene, Gandolfini in the equally infamousfight scene with Arquette, Pitt as a sedated stoner, Kilmer as a barelyvisible Elvis type imaginary friend. It really doesn't get much betterthan that, not to mention the palpable and pure chemistry that Slaterand Arquette share."True Romance" is a popcorn film of the highest order. It has stood thetest of time and remains a true cult classic.
