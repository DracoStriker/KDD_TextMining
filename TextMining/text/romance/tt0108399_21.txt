This film has to be one of the best films that came out in the 1990's.It has everything an audience could ask for; murder, action, romance,sex, comedy, drama and a great story behind it!Quite possibly my new favorite (written-by) Quintin Tarintino film. Ican't actually tell you what the film is about without ruining it, butlet's just say, it's excellent. It's not a chick flick or a guy movie,it's a little bit of both...but enough of each so that everyone canenjoy.I'm really excited about this film, because it's so cleverly written,with quite a bit of honesty and reality thrown into it, that you canenjoy it without getting frustrated from the unrealisticness of someparts, or the intensity of some of the other scenes. The acting was outstanding, and let's face it Christian Slater is nottoo ugly to watch in a movie, and Patricia Arquette's breasts had topbilling above her name I think. But, she herself was amazing. I don'tknow if she was nominated for this role, but she should have been,because she was excellent. Probably the best character and actor in thewhole movie. A lot stars are in this before they were "stars"including; Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, MichaelRappaport, Bronson Pinchot, and James Gandalfini.I recommend this film to everyone! It's an awesome movie, but mind therating. It's rated the way it is for a reason. There is some violenceand some nudity and sexual content that might not be suitable for some.I hope everyone takes a look...I'm adding it to my collection!
