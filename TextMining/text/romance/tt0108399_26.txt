True Romance is truly unique movie if you are at least fan of some sortof originally made movies. Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott's makesthis almost perfect.Casting is great also plot is great, it gives you fresh feeling andhappy face. No other movie is like this. Story begins in Detroit andgoes around, every moment gets better. Even the soundtrack is sowonderful you can't be bored.Really good storyline, keeps you awake and waiting the next step everyminute, sometimes makes you laugh and sometimes even cry if you areromantic type person.Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater, Dennis Hopper and ChristopherWalken ... No more need to say.I love this movie truly from my heart, I recommend to anyone who has IQmore than 20 ;)10/10
