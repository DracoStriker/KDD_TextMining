I don't know how anyone can watch this film without a positive reaction.  Itis great.  Can you go wrong with Tony Scott directing a Quentin Tarantinostory?  Oh yeah, and then there's the cast.  Possibly career performances byboth Slater and Arquette.  True Romance contains great dialogue fromTarantino, and Tony Scott gives the film the touch of action it needs toawaken.  Some of the most violent scenes I have seen.  They will blow youaway.  Of course, it all ends in a Mexican Standoff between the cops, themob, and a film producer's body guards.  A great story, an unbelievablecast, and out of this world action.  True Romance will keep you on the edgeof your seats.
