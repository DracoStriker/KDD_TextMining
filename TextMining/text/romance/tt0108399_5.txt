I've seen Reservoir Dogs, I've seen Pulp Fiction & I've seen Jackie Brown,but for me this is Tarantino's best crime caper.Completely engrossing from start to finish, the story of the two lovers whoare on the run is not entirely believable, but seriously enjoyable. You getyour fill of guns, sex, style and pop-culture, and the usual array ofcelebrity cameos in a film that seems a whole lot more 'close'. Whereas PulpFiction felt like one long trailer, with every line razor-sharp and a loadof hip music that made the film go so quickly, True Romance offers you thechance to savour every moment, as the film moves at a (slightly) slowerpace.Enjoy the blazing finale, and just wonder how it might have turned out ifTarantino had got his hands on the camera...
