I do not see why this film is so popular. It's kind of disappointing thatmany people believe this movie is comparable to Reservoir Dogs or PulpFiction. The cast is admirable, the acting is good, however the storyitselfhad no appeal to me, at least as it was portrayed by Tony Scott. ChristianSlater plays a silly, unbelievable character with a cocky smile on hisfacethroughout the movie. However, good one-scene performances come from GaryOldman and Dennis Hopper.4/10 - A good cast and acting can't make up for poor directing andcontent.
