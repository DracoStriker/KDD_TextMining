True Romance is obscure film. Film was unfortunate to come at the timein which huge blockbusters and award winning film were slowly coming toscreen, there of it was forgotten. All people to who I recommended thisfilm never heard about it, and when they saw it, they only have oneword: SUPERB! Tarantino who decided to split Natural born killers andTrue Romance scripts (which ere basically same script ) made terrifyingjob at it, but real star behind film is late Tony Scott. Without adoubt, this is best film Scott has ever made, and that can be seen inwhole film, from cast to score and even ending which is best thing thatScott decided to do, despite Tarantino's wishes, but even Tarantinohimself was pleased at the end of it. Scott gave himself into the filmand created cult masterpiece that will never be forgotten. Cast isterrifying. Cristian Slater before he become second rate actor andPatricia Arquete had believable chemistry on screen which made wholefilm. Supporting cast including Gary Oldman ( In his best role ever putto screen), Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Denis Hopper not tomention others, made beautiful ensemble cast which was not very wellknown at the time, but today, they are all first class actors. I couldwrite about this film for hours, but in the end I can only say thatwatch this film and enjoy one of best films ever made. Live fast, dieyoung, be a ice looking corpse!
