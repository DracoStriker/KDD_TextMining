Required viewing. A modern masterpiece. The scene between ChristopherWalken and Dennis Hopper is absolutely classic(the last last line iswhat I quoted in my summary). A 'learn how to be cool' movie. It'sfunny, thrilling, sarcastic. He's got an imaginary friend...and it'sELVIS! The juice of Tarantino. The birth of Scaggnetti (and TonySoprano.)Quotes are all over this flick. 'Do I look like a beautiful blonde withbig tits, and a ^$#%#@ that tastes like ice cream?.....then why are youlying to me?" Choose a f$$$ing lane! Don't give me the finger,I 'llhave you f###ing killed!" "I always liked you Clarence...." "The first time you kill somebody,that's hardest one....the second one ain't no f##### mardi gras, butit's still hard. The third one....you level off. ...Now I do do it justto watch there expression change.", James Gandolfini (Pre-Sopranos)showing raw talent as a cold-hearted killer. Brad Pitt hitting the bongand talking to shotgun wielding mafiosos with Soundgarden in thebackground..."You wanna hit?"....chick-chick(shotguns) "Ok, Well, yougo down Santa Clara for a while, then turn left, and keep driving for awhile...."It's true romance... He kills her pimp, and she takes a Royal beatingfor him. BUT the movies's not over. You have to have pulled some crazys*** in your life to totally appreciate this movie, but it is awesome."When you get out in two years you'll be so in touch with wife needscuz you'll know what's like to get f##### up the a##!"...Scagnetti"If it's anything this last week has taught me, is that it's better tohave a gun and not need it, than to need a gun and not have it.""Tell me I'm the dumbest motherf##### you've ever seen, or I'm gonnapump two into your face right now!" ...ClarenceNon-stop action. Ups and downs. Irony, and a realistic ending.Cameos...up and coming actors... it's all here. And most of all, "TrueRomance", which I believe is a totally accurate title. Absolutelybrilliant. A movie you can watch many times.You have to see this outstanding piece of work.
