Been waiting to see this one for a while and finally did about a weekago now.Well first off "True Romance" is simply great. It has a lot going forit in the form of a great plot , awesome performances outstandingactors and some good action scenes among many other things!.I just loved every second of it it oozed with style. You really cantell Tarantino write this one. It has his name all over it.Christian Slater gives easily his best performance as does PatriciaArquette.Every scene , every line , every action is so perfect!. It's actuallyquite hard to explain without making someone sit and watch it.My favourite performances were those of Gary Oldman, Slater , Arquetteand Walken.This film does not hold back it's full on when the violence is rollingand you can't help but love it!.That's all i'm gonna say JUST WATCH IT!8/10
