True Romance has everything necessary to create art on celluloid. From thewriting expertise of Quentin Tarantino to Tony Scott's brilliant directingto its cast of gifted actors, the movie is all that one would hope for.Beginning in Detroit and ending in Mexico, a loner that never really madehis mark on the world meets a call girl who falls as deeply in love with himas he does with her. Filled with drugs, gangsters, Hollywood and of courseromance, the movie's story becomes only stronger as the movie goes on.With exceptional performances by Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken (thescene they share is without equal), Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, theaction and violence only help to develop the plot and accentuate it'sintricacies. Its superb ending has since been imitated - by Tony Scott's ownEnemy of the State for one - but never as cleverly.A must see for any movie lover.
