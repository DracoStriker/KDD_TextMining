This movie is great from the opening scene to the last. I did hear thatthe originally written ending was different from what ended up on filmbut I still loved it! I challenge anyone to show me a better acted andwritten scene in cinema than the one between Chris Walken and DennisHopper. Just a powerful scene that is well directed by Tony Scott(RIP).Along with the beautiful soundtrack in that scene mixed with theintense dialogue and attitude, I promise you you will have it on yourmind for a very long time. The Unrated version of this film is the onlyway to go! Yes, there is a lot of violence but the violence is set upwith such emotion that it is difficult to not feel completeunderstanding with the characters as to why they did what they did andhow they did it. The scene with Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfiniis quite emotional as well. This scene catapulted Gandolfini into thego to guy if you wanted a believable old school mafioso in your filmand most likely helped him get his award winning role as the head ofthe Soprano family. I guarantee, if you love a violent well writtenunderdog story you will love this film. The tension filled final scenewill leave you breathless and wanting more but in the greatest waypossible. Thank you Quentin for such an amazing script and thank youTony Scott for doing what you do best!
