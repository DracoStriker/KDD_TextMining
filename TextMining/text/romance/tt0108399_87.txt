I think this movie is amazing the dialogue believable and sometimes abit funny. I may be biased but i'm a girl who loves killing spreemovies. or crime movies in general. But this movie was more than that,it had everything! humour, romance (or course), murder, action and drugdealing. lets face it: Christian Slater is at his best when he'sholding a gun. Think about it, Heathers was great (he killed a fewpeople) a pretty much MADE Very bad Things enjoyable. and now we havethis, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L Jackson, Brad Pitt and ChristopherWalken... what a cast! This is the best movie of Patricia Arquette'scareer, although i'm not well informed of her career but i havecertainly seen some of her other films. this obliterates them all. isit over the top? yes is it accurate? no. is it supposed to be over thetop and inaccurate? yes because it's a Tarentino movie. his films areamazing and thrilling, not accurate. who cares? just see it, thisreview hasn't been much help to you i'm sure but take my advice... seeit. it almost makes you want to be criminal.
