Here's a movie that seems to contain something for everybody..sex,romance, violence, tension, humor, great directing and some of yourall-time favorite actors. I wouldn't quite go as far as some of thereviewers here who wrote that it's the greatest movie of all time andit's so unpredictable. On both counts, it's not. I found it verypredictable, but with the acting so good and the movie so fastpaced...it didn't matter. I particularly loved Patricia Arquette. Shewas terrific and very hot and sexy. All I want to know is..where hasshe been hiding all these years? It seems that her resume is short andunimpressive. She deserves better. And just to watch James (TonySoprano) Gandolfini do his violent thing, was worth the price ofadmission in itself. True Romance is miles ahead of Pulp Fiction. Thecharacters here are so believable and sympathetic. I would compare itmore to Bonnie & Clyde. So I recommend it highly for its acting,directing, and story line. But don't eat your dinner just before youwatch the movie.
