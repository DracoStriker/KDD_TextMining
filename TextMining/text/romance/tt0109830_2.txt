When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. Ithink it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Justrecently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and movingmeaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning ofit. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That aninnocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaningof the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook onlife. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not letthe big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw ustrials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have tojust bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That weall need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place thatfeels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone whohasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggestseeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...
