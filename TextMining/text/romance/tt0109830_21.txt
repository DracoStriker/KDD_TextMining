I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptablebehavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, dosomething that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and getthings under control.I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over thehill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side,clean-cut and happy.Forrest states the obvious, "Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!"And the water-works just started to flow.I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). Mywife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, "That's why I love you."Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none ofwhich are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect,emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen. I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with thelowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filledwith a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and ToKill a Mockingbird.When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop mykeys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says,"Hey, Boo," the fob goes flying.The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US Historykids, I'll start fingering my key chain. I can't help it.
