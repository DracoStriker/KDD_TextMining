There is an unfortunate time when you watch this film, its not the filmthats the problem its my highly evident fear of the next few films Iwatch just seeming so bad. For simply not being this. Its everything.Its a romantic-comedy-tragedy-life-story-historical-personal-uplifting-war story. Every time I watch it I go on an emotional journeywith the characters that are quickly built up in the world aroundForrest. There is not much more I can say about this film that will sayhow much i like it, apart from award it the accolade that is; Myfavourite film. Over time the film stands up, the performances seem toget better knowing how Hanks has gone on to be a great actor. Hissupporting cast do a great job of making the world of the film feelbelievable.
