This movie, nothing more than a cheesy scenes needlessly throwntogether, truly has no heart or point to it, and is among the worstthat I have seen. It attempts to do everything without focusing itsattempts. Just like the way that a person who tries to multitask onlydoes a semi-good job on either task, this movie does no good job atanything. If the movie were sped up, it would seem like a parody ofHollywood films. I am honestly shocked that anyone enjoyed this film.Not only did the Oscars like it, they liked it more than "The ShawshankRedemption" and "Pulp Fiction", both among the best movies of alltime,and both released in the same year.
