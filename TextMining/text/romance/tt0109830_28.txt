i don't usually watch many family type movies, but forrest gump ishonestly one of my favourite movies to watch with my son and partner.tom hanks is a wonderful actor and in this movie it shows! there aresome tears, some comedy, some laughter, some sadness, just basically alot of emotions that shows we are all human in one way or another. inever get tired of watching it and seem to learn life lessons everytime i watch it because i have forgotten some small phrase or action orsomething, then think oh wow forgot about that! then it seems familiarlike an old friend - it is that sort of movie. very highly recommend itto anyone!
