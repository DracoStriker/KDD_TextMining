Since I first saw this film at the age of 8, Forrest Gump has alwaysbeen my favourite film. As a child this film was magical and Forrestinspired me with his ability to run fast. The scene where he breaksfrom his leg braces is iconic and highlights how well the movie matchesmusic to emotion. The Forrest Gump theme music by Alan Silvestri hitsthe mark and truly captures the beauty of a feather moving in the wind.The movie uses the theme of life being like a box of chocolates. Younever know what you're going to get. What the audience gets is top tiercinema production on all levels. The director Robert Zemeckis deliversa visually stunning film that shows so much of the American Dream. Theacting showcases Tom Hanks, Sally Field and Gary Sinise in theirelements and they bring such life and dimension to the characters as wefollow Forrest and his Mama across the decades. The movie tackles someof the hard topics with grace and surprising wit, all the while beingrespectful and quite informative of many historical moments withoutgetting caught up wasting too much time on any one moment. The film topersonally becomes one of understanding WHY exactly Forrest was able tobe so successful. Luck? Funny script? Are we to believe its like themovie Being There where a man can succeed by the Mr magooing of hisignorance and naiveté. No. Forrest is successful because he istrusting. He puts his faith in others and in return friends help him.Sure a man of lesser intelligence can be swindled and taken advantageof but the story says that a man who works hard, trusts his fellow manand loves his mama and his god will succeed in America. The AmericanDream.
