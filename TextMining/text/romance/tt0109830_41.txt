I recently saw this film again and was interested to see whether it hadimproved with time or I had mellowed in my opinion of it. Not a chance!The film looks even more tritely prelapsarian than ever. Basically thefilm is an unashamedly reactionary piece of brain candy floss, sicklyand insubstantial. In this films universe Simplicity = Good Social change = Bad. Agents ofsocial change = very bad and therefore they must contract AIDS. If itwasn't so nauseating it would be funny. Unfortunately, the Academy took it seriously and it picked up Oscars,when they should have booed it off the screen. Cynically sickly andmorally bankrupt its a disgrace.Incidentally Jamie Russell in his book "Vietnam War Movies" wrote;"Forrest Gump is Hollywood at its most horrendous...Whats most worryingis that the British Board of Film Classification saw fit to give thisevil little film a U certificate. How can we protect our childrenagainst such insidious brainwashing" How accurate an insight.
