From start to finish, what a journey. I thoroughly enjoyed this film,it is at times funny and emotional. Though sometimes it can alsodeliver some action, this film is indeed an all rounded brilliantperformance from Tom Hanks. This is a movie with a story that isactually interesting, unlike other films where there can be a longbackstory which drags on and on.... With this film though you get tosee Forrest from a young child grow to become a man that has a purposein and sense in life. This story is well structured from start tofinish and provides realism even in this day an age of what life startsout as and what becomes of us. I really enjoyed the fact Forrestexperienced almost everything possible in life in this movie and showedus how he overcame and tackled the obstacles in his way, and alsodisplayed the strength to overcome his weaknesses and loses in life.
