Forest Gump Review Forest Gump is always running away from danger, bullies, football, andsometimes just because. Running helps face many ups and downs in hislife. As the protagonist trying to find love he can't get it becausethe love of his life can't see past his simple mind until it's toolate. While Forest is achieving great success in his life by becoming afootball star, a army hero, a ping pong champion, a shrimp boatcaptain, and a nationally known runner, he still wants Jenny. The filmwas produced in 1994 by Paramount Studios and Steve Tisch, SteveStarkey, Wendy Finerman. Forest who is born simple in Alabama duringthe period of segregation in our country and he has many obstacles as achild because people refer him as stupid, but his mother tells him heis not and to not to listen to them. He also has to have "magic legs"to help walk better, and he learns at an early age that he can runanywhere faster than he can walk. The movie moves thru history asForest ages, and takes him to Vietnam and many other great adventures.He finds a lifelong friend along the way in his army Lieutenant, andForest is always thinking about Jenny his childhood friend, wishing tobe with her. The effects set the mood of each scenes and capture the timesespecially during the war scenes with the music and the sounds ofviolence. The songs played in each time sequence of the movie help youestablish what period Forest is in. The theme is you never know what you are going to get in life and youwill never be prepared so you need to make the best of everything. Hopethat along the way that best always happens and try not to get offtrack. In my opinion this movie is one of the best movies that I haveseen. It's got a good story, good music, and you the message is onethat everyone should try for. I rate this movie a 10 out of a 10.
