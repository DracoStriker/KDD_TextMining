Have to add two cents to the pile, not anything new. The work is sostunning in character, depth of story, direction, camera, editing,acting, and whatever else that makes a movie, that there is hardlyanything to say, except see it if you haven't, and see it again if youhave.Having lived through much of the period so incredibly depicted in thework, and having had many similar experiences,(a bit less dramatic, butemotionally equal), the work is as real as memory. The emotional powercreated in the work is overwhelming and wonderful. The Gump character,as vehicle through those incredible years, is cinematic genius,hilarious, ridiculous, endearing, hideous and heartbreaking, in aperfect body of work. Just see the flik, and please believe in it'saccuracy as historic work, parody, irony, and any other five cent wordsthat describe poetic perfection in a movie. It is as true as it gets onany level. Apocalypse Now may be the most accurate depiction of thepsychology of war victims(I.e.combatants) ever produced, and Gump isequally perfect describing the psychology of the rest of us, mirroredagainst the character Gump, unchanged, unaffected, pure, but intenselyhuman, perhaps perfectly human. Our reaction to this film is a greatway to measure ourselves as human beings. What more can you say about aflik?
