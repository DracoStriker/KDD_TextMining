Forrest Gump has always been one of my favorite movies, and it remainsa classic of American films. From its ability to put Tom Hanks'character in different historic backgrounds to the amazingcinematography, this film never fails to entertain. I recommend it toanyone, regardless of preference of genre because this film has alittle bit of everything.Tom Hanks is one component of makes this film so timeless. He is ableto completely transform into this eccentric yet somewhat brilliantcharacter of Forrest Gump and make us believe that he is real. I amable to say, with confidence, that this film would not be the samewithout Tom Hanks' acting.
