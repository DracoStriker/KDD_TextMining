I really love this film and I have seen it many many times.It is extremely moving and powerful which is exactly what a film (ofthis genre) should be. If you want to watch a comedy, go watch acomedy, nobody is denying that this is not a romantic-comedy full ofbelly laughs but it is a real tear jerker and makes you think and TomHanks totally deservedly won an Oscar for being such an outstandingactor. It is really a fantastic film, there are not enough ways for meto express that. It makes you think and it touches you and it is *very*hard for the film crew (actors,directors,cameraman etc) to be able toachieve that but they have. I seriously don't understand how people canbe so critical and hate this. I do not (well hardly ever) watch a movieexpecting to critise it, that is not what movies are for. And *ofcourse* you are not going to like some of the characters because theyare not *meant* to be likable!! Thats just how some people are, a filmcannot portray everyone as sugary sweet and perfect. I understand thatnot everybody will think it is fantastic but I do not understand thenegative comments, to me they seem silly because I think this is awonderful film, one of the best ever. The best thing about this film isthat it goes through lifes highs and lows just it does for real people.
