Spoiler Oooh! The drama! The tragedy! The pointlessness.Forest Gump is the inane story of an insipid person with the usualHollywood slant. A brain-dead person somehow shapes the course ofhistory and we are supposed to believe it.The drama is over the top and forced. Are we really supposed to crywhen his girlfriend dies during the early AIDS years? "I caught avirus" she says. Come now now, at that time most of the infected peoplewere promiscuous homosexual men.And in the end we find out that the brain-damaged Gump is wiser thannearly everybody else. This one is so bad it must have Tom Hanks in it.
