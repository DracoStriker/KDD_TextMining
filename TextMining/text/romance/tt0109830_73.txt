First off let me be fair about the movie...nice special effects. Now withthat said sit back and let me rip the hell out of this horrible movie. Ipersonally think Paramount and Robert Zemekis were handing out their ownbatch of Jim Jones Kool Aid at every theater in America when this was out.From start to finish I dont think I have ever seen a movie (I say movie,because this is not a film) that is more predictable, melo-dramatic, orsterotypicable. How in the world this dreck won best picture is beyond me.Ipersonally believe the Academy was doing Speilberg a favor and awarded hisbuddy Zemekis for making an overblown bad film. Lets face it if this movieonly grossed 60 million it would have been cosidered a failure and wouldhave won best special effects and thats IT!!! In my opinion this is Ishtarpart 2, without Isabelle Adjani. This movie was a forshadow of things tocome from Zemekis. Contact, Cast Away, What lies Beneath; although betterfilms than Forrest Gump just proves Zemekis has sold his soul to the BIGHOLLYWOOD garbage machine. Come back Bob, you were once a promisingdirector.
