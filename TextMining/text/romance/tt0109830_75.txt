This film is one of my all time favorite film. He goes through life ona cloud, which could be each of us. I hated that she penned the baby onhim, which is crazy. I love the fact of the Bama football, roll tide.This is a great film, powerful, magical, passionate. He had a goodlife, only thing he couldn't figure out why she just didn't love him. Iloved the comedy, also didn't know Tom had it in him. This film hadsome very powerful moments, that are life lessons. The story is truly aride of a life time. Whatever he put his mind too, he did it and waspretty good at it. I would've loved to be apart of this cast, verypowerful.
