I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, andForrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, orthe second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you likeit. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were stillgaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (Forexample: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout themovie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says alot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing. Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who seeit once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usuallyjust looking for the most "action," gore and sex they can find, andhaven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, andlife.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of=truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specificaspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about itas well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it somemore. Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies -- if not THE greatest-- ever made.
