I believe the cast; as a whole, were amazing...but this movie is thewhole reason I absolutely love Tom Hanks! His performance wasoutstanding to me! This movie has such a heartfelt message, you can'thelp but fall in love with it (unless you're a heartless piece of trashthat is). Following Forest's life story captivates you from thebeginning as you learn all the hardships he had to overcome startingfrom a very young age and ending with the present in the movie (afterhe finishes telling his story and you follow him in the present). It'sjust hands down an amazing movie that made me cry and smile, laugh andyell in anger, and helped me realize judgment is the worst crime anyonecan commit!!
