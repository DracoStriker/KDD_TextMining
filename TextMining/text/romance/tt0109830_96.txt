Awesome movie! This is my favorite movie. The story, the soundtrack andthe actors (Tom Hanks is excellent in this role)is very well composed.Although Forrest Gump is considered "dumb", he manages to do greatthing with his life. A classic, definitely watch it! 10 out of 10. Alot of laughs, serious moments, sad parts, and interesting scenescombined into a jumble of greatness. Forrest does overcome manyobstacles, which makes this movie even greater. A classic in myopinion. If you have ever considered watching the movie, pop it in, sitdown and prepared to be mesmerized by this spectacular movie. I hopeyou enjoy this movie and much as I did!
