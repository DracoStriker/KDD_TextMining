Thirteen years after Titanic launched and all it takes is the first fewbars of that haunting music to transport me back to my first timewatching the movie in the theater. It was beyond comprehension - theentire spectacle and production. I bought the books, read the historybooks and found myself immersed in all things Titanic.I didn't hurt that my great, great aunt was on the ship and survived.It makes it a little personal for me. In fact, I happen to own one ofthe only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboatand did not go into the water.Love the movie - it still is #1 in my book.
