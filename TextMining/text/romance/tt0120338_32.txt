Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guywho has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, butthis movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?)but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence,assurances of it being "unsinkable" - tease the audience, almost to thepoint where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared aboutthe characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the timeto introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful,even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the FirstOfficer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end whenyou see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into totalchaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to takeher to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irishmother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. Theviolinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage.And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right atthe end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilledher promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having metanyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, greatacting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic,enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higherthan 7.7.
