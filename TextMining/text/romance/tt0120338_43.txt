Titanic has made movie history!! It's unbelievable that such a badtearjerker can be doing so well at the box office!!Where is the plot? Well, the movie does have ... sort of a plot, but it'svery very very weak. The love between Jack and Rose is so superficial.Where are the characters? I can't find any real character! Everywhere Ilook, I find cliches and stereotypes. The rich must be arrogant, ignorant,evil, etc, while the poor must be the exact opposite.Can the actors act? Sure, every single one can but not in this movie. Theacting is somewhere between so-so and bad! I've seen better performance fromCathy Bates, Leonardo DiCarpio, Bill Paxton.. in other movies.The visual effects is the only saving grace! The sinking of the ship is justmagnificent!! It's just a shame they could have spent so much money torecreate the ship but they couldn't create a good story that has characterswith substance!For teenagers who are flooded with hormones and a not-so-well-developedbrain, it's understandable that they love the movie. For those who love itbecause it makes them cry, I suggest cutting an onion. It's much cheaper andtears come out faster!!
