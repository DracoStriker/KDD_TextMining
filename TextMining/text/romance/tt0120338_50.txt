People talked a lot about this movie, before, after and during the time ofproduction. One thing I was sure about when the pieces fall in it's placethat this movie is made to be a cash machine and not a masterpiece.Everyoneknows the story, the old well known one. Nothing wrong with old knownstories but the combination with other common regular boring side storiesmake the whole thing unbearable. At last I went to see it, at theUniversityPhilm Club theater. It started bad and it became worst, more than threehourof suffering, and I don't talk about the suffer of passenger of Titanic, Iam talking about my own and the other people with me sitting therewatchingthis nonsense. The last hour almost killed me, I put my head between mylegsand raised my head to see what's going on every other minute. I didn'tmissanything, the story went on very slow, slow, slow ... It's looked like theproducer and the other guys there realized that the have spent a lot ofmoney so they made the movie an hour longer.Anyway I was lucky to see it in a theater with a break in the middle ofthemovie, and I am happy that I didn't pay to see it.
