You know those films where you just leave your brain at the lobby and comeback for it when the movie is finished, realizing you didn't have a goodtime without it? Like Armageddon?Well, this is one of those 'brain-free' experiences. However, this isreallyenjoyable brain candy. OK, so the script could have been better written byawriter from Sunset Beach, but you have to commend this film for it's goodpoints: Kate Winslet's performance, the historical detail, the sheerenjoyability of it all.True, the script seems to be the source of all the problems: DiCaprio is afine actor, but unfortunately his character hasn't been written well enoughfor him to give a performance with any true depth. This also makes the lovestory seem a little weak, and in the end, unmoving.Nevertheless, this is one of the most enjoyable mainstream movies of lastyear, and definetly worth $7.50 of your money, or if you're British, £4.8/10
