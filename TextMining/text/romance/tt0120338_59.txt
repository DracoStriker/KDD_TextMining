As an epic, it doesn't change, even a little, my perception of life. As alove story, I've seen better. However, I have to say - technically - andasentertainment - Titanic is great. The special effects, the replica of theship, and all other technical details are a feast for the eyes. And itcertainly entertains, as it never lapses to boredom and although it's over3hours long, it doesn't really register.Anyway, I'd say it is quite worth the watch. Just don't expect it tochangeyour life.
