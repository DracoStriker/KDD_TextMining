I saw this movie in the theatre's back in 1997 and remembered it as abrilliant movie. The cinematic experience was one of the best of mylife even though the story is tragic and very sad. I recently watchedthis film with my 13 year old daughter. The magic is still there. Thisis still one of the best movies of all time and perhaps the greatestlove story of all time. The new blue ray release is fantastic and JamesHorner's score is still timeless. Great job James Cameron...forproducing a once in a lifetime film. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winsletwere fantastic in this film and both deserved best actor/actressawards.Don't be afraid to bring this one back out people... its still abeautiful epic that will stand the test of time.
