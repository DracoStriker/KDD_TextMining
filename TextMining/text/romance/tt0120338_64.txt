I remember the hype surrounding this movie and coming from the samepart of the world where the titanic was built I thought this will begreat. Well I watched this on video and was stunned' take a historicaldisaster and turn it into a romance novel' lol james Cameron hasarrived. Its a real shame because I really liked the terminator' butthat was when he was broke and visual effects were in its infancy theirony is the more money he makes the worse the movie and its not likethis was a one off' it spawned other historical disasters like pearlharbour which was a titanic rip off. But the main problem for me wasthe whole movie surrounds the three main characters and everyone elseon the ship was just window dressing and I like a lot of other guyscouldn't wait until the ship sank. The only good thing I have to say isit made a big star out of dicaprio, and he has went on to bigger andbetter things. So this movie was a real bummer for me and a lot ofothers i'm sure.
