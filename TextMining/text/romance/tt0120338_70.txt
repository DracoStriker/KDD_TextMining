Simply put, Titanic is one of the most overrated movies of all time, interms of how much money it made, how many people seem to like it, andhow many awards it won. While the performances from Dicaprio (playingJack), Winslet (playing Rose) and other supporting roles like the shipCaptain are solid, the film on a whole just isn't. To sum up the filmin one word would be "boring" or "generic". Titanic does't become thedisaster movie until the very end, up until that its an extremelygeneric "poor-boy-meets-rich-girl" love story, something thats beendone a billion times before. The film is also filled with completelytwo dimensional characters which I guess I supposed to reflect thetimes, with the segregation between the rich and the poor. Even so, thecharacters such as the one played by Billy Zane as Rose's rich husbandto be, are just lazily written with no character other than"I'm-rich-and-I-hate-the-poor-toff-toff". The film overall is just abore, and gets only mildly interesting when the boat actually startssinking. Absolutely nothing special about this film whatsoever. One ofthe most overrated movies of all time.
