It is always the way in Hollywood these days, Why let history get in the wayof a blockbuster movie. Titanic has plenty of good points about it, but anystudent of the disaster could not help but be disappointed. Especially withthe glaring inaccuracies and cliches this movie had tooffer.The American's brash and almost looking like they knew the damn ship wouldsink.The British, stiff and emotionless in first class who would given the chancebe quite happy to shoot the Irish peasants on the lower decks if the wereallowed.The British lower classes were a bunch of thugs.The Poor Irish as a load of Guinness swigging biddly biddly dancing bumpkins,clearly the victims in the disaster.The point I am try to make is that the tragedy of 1912 was a multilayeredaffair, with moments of great sadness and bravery throught the two plushours of the ships sinking. I feel that James Cameron had sacrificed thisfor the love story of Rose and Jack which is a shame.I did enjoy Titanic but I thought it was a missed opportunity to show whathappened. For my money a far more moving film about the sinking of theTitanic was "A Night To Remember" with Kenneth More and Honor Blackmanamongst others.The Titanic story is a deeply emotion subject I would truly recommend ANight To Remember if you want to watch a film about the sinking of theTitanic and watch Titanic if you want to watch a Love Story.
