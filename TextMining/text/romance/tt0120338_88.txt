This movie had it's themes backwards: the part about the Titanic itself wasincredibly well done, and very suspenseful.  However, the love story wasmore predictable than the story of the ship.  It was the stock love story,which has been beaten to death over the years.  Leonardo Di Caprio gave anun-convincing performance which destroyed the movie evenfurther.
