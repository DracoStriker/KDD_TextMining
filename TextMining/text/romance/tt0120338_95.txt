I'm one of the cynics, and am quite proud of it, thanks. I cannotfathom why this film received any Oscars apart from anything forspecial effects (in that department, it excels). Yes, the actualcracking apart and sinking of the legendary ocean liner was extremelywell done. But as for the rest, just one word: disappointment.First, there's Leo--not a terrible actor, but pretty limited here. AndKate? About the same goes for her. Then, there is the story. It wouldhave been more interesting if it had focused on the lives of others whowere actually on the ship--including the crew. It's also painfullyover-long, AND it has a Celine Dion song to boot. How much more wrongcan it possibly get? An overrated piece of dross indeed.
