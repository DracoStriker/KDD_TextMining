Despite the millions it may have raked in, I'm sorry, this is one of theabsolute worst movies I have ever seen.  Not that I don't think all thepraise in the world for the technical side shouldn't be heaped upon it, thevisual effects were undisputably stunning, but this is Hollywood at itsworst : pure candyfloss.  Completely contrived, sugarcoated andpoorly-written, Titanic is a waste of any thinking viewers'time.
