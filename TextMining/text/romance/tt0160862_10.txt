Prinze Jr. and especially Cook areterrific in the movie. Walker gets to play the biggest jerk in themovie and he is sometimes amusing. But it is Lillard steals the show inhis supporting performance. It was an surprise Box Office hit back inthe winter of 1999. This movie is remember for the two leadperformances and an good song by the ill-faded band "Sixpence None TheRicher" titled "Kiss Me".The movie is double feature with "Down to You". Another Prinze Jr.movie. DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and angood Dolby Stereo 2.0 Surround Sound. "She's All That" does have anfamiliar supporting cast like Kevin Pollak, Kieran Culkin, EldenHanson, Usher Raymond, Clea DuVall, Tim Matheson and more. "She All'sThat" is certainly one of the better teen movies of the late 1990's.This movie is make fun well in "Not Another Teen Movie". Sarah MichelleGellar appears uncredited. (*** ½/*****).
