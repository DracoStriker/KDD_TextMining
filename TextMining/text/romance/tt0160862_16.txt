WARNING: (might contain spoilers) (of course this movie is so predictable,Idon't believe it is possible to have spoilers)This movie is a cesspool of cliches, swearing, cute but untalented actors,and lots of "hip" and "cool" so-called "music."  Freddie Prinze, Jr. playsthe typical popular guy. (i guess that's because he plays soccer, thatmakeshim popular, just like real high school, right?) Anyway, hisbleached-brainfriends start a bet to turn an ugly duckling into a prom queen.Unfortunately, they already picked a beautiful swan.  In fact, the moviepoints out that Cooke's only "ugly" attribute is that she wears glasses.And, naturally, we assume that glasses make her nerdy and ugly.  It wouldhave been much more interesting if they picked an overweight girl withbraces, and started an alternate day bulk-up routine and a diet ofSlim-Fast, to make her skinny enough for prom-queen acceptable.  Instead,the filmmakers make it easy on themselves by simply getting the girlcontacts.  The rest of the movie tries to make us believe that this is howhigh school students behave and act, and becomes offensive.  I hatedwatching the scenes of the big parties, the walking on the beach, and theunsightly hair on the pizza.  Don't any of these students take time tostudyand learn?  Oh, no.  Of course not.  That's what all the nerdy people do,and we're trying to make them prom queen.  And prom queens do not likebooks(according to the movie)  Anyway, I am sorry to say that I saw this movie,luckily I saw it at the dollar theater.  I'm hoping that Hollywood willcomeout with a satrical, unique high-school comedy in the future.  I continuetowait...
