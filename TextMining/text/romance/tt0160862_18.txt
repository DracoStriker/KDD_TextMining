I sat at home with nothing better to do. I was very frustrated. I wastring to decide weather or not to put in "The Passion Of The Christ"and despite my better judgement, I put on "Shes All That".While Rachel Leigh Cook Is a knockout all dressed to impress she wasn'tanywhere near ugly with her glasses and overalls on. Plaid is kindasexy on her.And of all the people to be the lead hard on, Freddie Prinze Jr.?Pa-leezzze.so I sat through a 2 hour lecture on how "Were all pretty on theinside" when in fact the characters were in no way ugly. the onlyugliness was Freddie Prinze Jr.'s acting.I've got a pet monkey that could play a better lead man.I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life.Thank God I didn't pay money to rent it.from now on I will trust my gut on picking a movie.Id rather watch Jesus Get beaten over watching Freddie Prinze Jr. beathis dads name into the ground.No wonder his dad shot himself.I gave it a 5 for the Rachel Leigh Cook stairway scene. What can I say,I'm a sentimental guy.
