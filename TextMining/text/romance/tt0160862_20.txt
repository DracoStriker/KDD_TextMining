Freddie Prinze Jr. definitely proves he can be a leading man in "She's AllThat." Furthermore, the storyline was well written and heartwarming towatch. I enjoyed how the writers came up with the idea; "jock and cool guy" riskinghis reputation to talk with people who were not in his social circles. Thegirl, played by Rachel Leigh Cook, came out of her acting shell and turnedinto a butterfly with her role. All the young actors were refreshing to see since they brought somethingspecial to their roles. I highly recommend "She's All That" because it is areally refreshing film to see. The new and upcoming stars break out and showwhat they are made of as well as the believable storyline; and how it flowstogether into one long continuous scene.
