This film disturbed me... it disturbed me because I was shocked that a topHollywood studio was stupid enough to churn out yet anotherpathetic-commercialised-excuse of a movie that is so predictable that youmight as well fast-forward to the closing credits to save yourself time...freddie prinze jnr is as wonderful as ever - take that to mean what youwant...... the only positive thing i have to say about this film is thatcleaduvall appears in it... briefly... and vomiting... not very positivethen.i think i'd better stop now before somebody *flames* me.
