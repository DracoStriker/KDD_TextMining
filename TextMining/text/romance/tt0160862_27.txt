Rachael Leigh Cook stars in this filled with clichés movie that may bebetter enjoyed by girls. Don't get me wrong; I did watch it because Ididn't have anything else to do and it aired on late cable and I endedup liking it for what it is: a typical teenager American flick with amessage.There are many, many clichés like the nerdy girl who suddenly becomesvery sexy and desirable and the jock who ends up falling in love withher.There are elements that make this a chick flick but on the other hand,there are some scenes that make it a clever teen comedy.I can recommend it for those who are still on their 20's and want towatch how young American society behaved in the late 90's.Leigh Cook shines in the lead role; she's perky, petit, sexy and fresh.
