"She's All That" (1999) is a school dramedy/romance flick -- more dramathan comedy -- about a pretty, but outcast, mousy girl (Rachael LeighCook) who suddenly has a couple of popular guys interested in takingher to the prom (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Paul Walker). Their motivationsare questionable and it stirs up the hot vixen of the school (Jodi LynO'Keefe). Matthew Lillard, Anna Paquin and Lil Kim are also featured.The cast is great and this is a worthy story about a social outcastcoming out of hiding, so to speak. But the potential depth of the plotneeded fleshed-out more and the film's just too sentimental for mytastes -- numerous moments where characters share deep feelings, etc.Don't get me wrong, I can get into some share-your-feelings typescenes, but I didn't care enough about the characters here to make itmeaningful or engrossing.Still, the message is good and the main cast members are superb. Plusthere's no raunch, which is refreshing. Those who enjoy sentimentalitywill appreciate it more than I did.The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area(Redondo Beach, Malibu, Torrance and Cerritos).GRADE: C+ or B-
