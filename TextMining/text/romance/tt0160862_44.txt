I love this movie, and still watch it all the time! I was so stokedwhen I found out that one of my all time favorite bands, New FoundGlory remade the best song (and most memorable one) on the soundtrack,"Kiss Me"! I really love their version of it and cant wait for theirnew cd From the Screen to Your Stereo Part 2! So yeah check out theirmyspace to hear it for free, I know you'll love it too! Actually I amgonna go watch it again right now, I love a good romance and this istotally an awesome one that I can really relate to! I think most of thekids in our generation can agree with that so yeah what are you doin gowatch and listen!
