" She`s all that " is not original but it`s a lot of fun.Freddie Prinze Jnr provides his best ever screen performance in the leadrole while Rachel Leigh Cook is excellent as the girl he fallsforand there is good from the likes of Matthew Liliard,Paul Walker,Kierian"Igby"Culkin and Kevin "Usual Suspects" Pollak.In all a good film......oh yeah and that Sarah Michelle Gellar schoolcanteen cameo is absoluely priceless.
