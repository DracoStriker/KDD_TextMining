Another one of the teen movie blah generation, but at least "She's" givesyou a good feeling at the end.  Still, its hard to not find Rachel LeighCook's Boggs attractive even before and simply removing her hair facets andglasses while putting her in a sexier dress is not transformation. The magicwas used to make her look less attractive--a girl who is beautiful--andhonestly, though the point of inner beauty is portrayed, it's just asquickly supressed as you get the feeling Mr. Prinze Jr. might not have beenso loving had she stayed the same.  And of course she stays different.. why?What point is that truly conveying.  To me, the premise was better then apicture and while Prinze was hot at the time--meaning popular--he doesn'tadd anything to the picture.  Cook is wonderful and for me, carried thefilm, but I'd much rather have seen a true transfermation as to prove to methe writers/directors truly cared more about the point then the profit.C+
