I rented this movie because I read it had quite a few Buffy the Vampirealumni in it and it sound like it might be funny. Well, as for the BtVSfolk. Tara was an extra at a party with no lines and around 3 secondsscreentime and the *invisible* girl had a only a couple lines and around thesameamount of minutes screen time.  Seth Green had a big part. The problemis,although he gave it his best shot, the character/dialog was so cliche' '(white kid who acts like a black kid to try to fit in wiht the coolcrowd)you could care less. And I'd say he was the best of the lot. Hewitt'scharacter could have been good but wasn't fleshed out. Same goes forwhoeverthe actress was who played Seth Green's childhood friend. The other werenothing more than flat stereotypes. The humor was pathetic,the dramaticattempts contrived,  and the story seemed not only unpolished butunfinished. What could have been an amusing, interesting tale of a groupofpeople growing up, remembering where they came from, and wondering whatliesin thier future came off like the filming of a kid's first creativewritingcourse assignment - before the teacher's corrections and rewrites.1.5/10
