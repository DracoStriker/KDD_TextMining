This movie is as bad as I first thought it would be, the only good thing isRachael Leigh Cook that, like in "Tangled", made a movie that is a completewaste of time. Ok, she started her career with this movie, before that shewas hardly known in Hollywood but the story is more than awful, I know whythe director hasn't made any other film yet.Although being very bad the film has it's moments, like the mixing of theschool and the pool at the beginning, and the program "Real World L.A."being broadcasted with the character of the movie, but that isn't enough,there are a lot of things bad explained, want examples? Why no one likedLaney before - except the fat one - but she gets 46% of the votes?, why thebad guys who spoiled the pizza were forced to eat it, weren't they twoagainst one? Of course, worst than that is: why is Sarah Michelle Gellar at that schooland wasn't nominated to be prom queen?I think that Freddie Prinze Jr. enjoyed making it or he wouldn't be also in"Boys and Girls" another as bad as this one.The only good think I can say about the movie is that I've discovered thatRachael Leigh Cook (who is fabulous is AntiTrust, a must see computer movie)is left-handed like me.
