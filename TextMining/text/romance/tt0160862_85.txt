I really love this genre. Probably cause my teenage years were never thatexciting as they always seem to be in the movies. Maybe because I would verymuch like to be that young again to prevent some fatal mistakes. Be that asit may, I am very open-minded to teenage comedies. I love most of them.Nut now what have we here? A film right out of this genre that really boredme. The story and the characters lacks the power necessary to incite thistypical teen charme humor - the kind of humor you just relax, sit back andenjoy the ride. In this movie, something does not work together. Is it thefact that Freddie Prince Junior looks absolutely out of place? Is it thatthe finale is simply boring instead of chaotic and exciting? Is it thatthere have been too many much funnier teen comedies lately (American Pie,Road Trip...)?All in all, a movie you can forget immediately after viewing. Or evenbetter: Just forget viewing it in the first place. It's not worth thetime.
