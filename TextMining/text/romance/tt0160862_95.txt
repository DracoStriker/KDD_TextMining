It is essentially the same story line as 10 Things I Hate About You.  On abet the cool guy dares to date the unapproachable girl and true loveensues.Terribly unrealistic, sure, but still one of the 25 great recycledplots.This is a very entertaining film.  Like most teen movies, as I'm prettysureI've seen them all, its nothing to be taken too seriously, but it does havecool tunes and hotties which is all any good teen comedy needs.
