The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place,perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me ofhis character in "The Ref" and that could only be a good thing. AnnetteBening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloidversion of a "Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf" Which means very close tosomeone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazingdexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are WestBentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writingthis 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the wholehullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a majorstar. He is amazing in "American Beauty" the complexities of hischaracter are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to faceup to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object ofhis attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.
