Watching "American Beauty" is like looking into a handful of American livesslowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these peopleare gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losingtheir grip on human value and order. This is not your average socialcommentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand,thisis a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround aseemingly "perfect" suburban family, displaying what it would be like ifeveryone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from thepainful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand,"American Beauty" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastatingcharacter study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time intheir lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselvesand each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitablyfollow."American Beauty" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery ofbeauty fused with violence and tragedy, to it's darkly hilarious script,this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But themain thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin SpaceyandAnette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married coupleexploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari andThora Birch also showcase excellent performances. A truly remarkablefilm.
