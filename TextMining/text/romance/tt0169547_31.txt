My fiancee & I saw this movie at a sneak preview showing in her college. The big lab building was filled with mature college students, and there werethose who still haven't grown up yet.  The lights dimmed and the moviestarted.  It started out with Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey), in ashort monologue with an overview of the city they live in.  From that momentuntil the ending credits rolled, I did not blink, I did not budge...exceptwhen I laughed...and BOY did I laugh.  The movie itself was a bit....shall Isay..oh...weird.  My fiancee didn't like it too much, cuz it was too weirdfor her.I thought it was a very serious movie, but with most of the serious scenes,it contains lots of humor.  That's why I thought this movie was very good &original.  It's very very serious, but at the same time, it was hilariousand shocking.Please do NOT take your kids to this movie either (like I saw some parentsdo in American Pie), it's very BOLD & BRAVE.  It has Kevin Spacey nearlycommits statutory rape, it has Spacey masturbating (it actually showed it!),and it had Annette Benning having sex with Peter Gallagher..<very roughhard sex>.  In short, I think Spacey & Benning & Chris Cooper (the Neo-Nazi marine) alldeserve oscars for this movie!   As for best picture, as of right now,there's no movie as bold, daring & very well acted like this movie is.  So,American Beauty, you have my votes!
