This has to be one of the, if not the best films I have ever seen. Theperformances by Spacey, Bening, Birch, and all the other actors wereamazing. They will all be hopefully remembered at awards time. The thingthat makes this movie so great is not only the stellar cast, but also thetruthful and solid writting. This film was superb, and it will berememberedas one of the best films ever made.
