I loved the acting and the under laying messaging. There are so manylayers and emotions acted in such a splendid way. The Oscar nominationare well deserved I advice you to see this movie, Its one of thoseclassics that you cant miss.I could really relay to Lester Burnham and his questions to what'simportant in life.
