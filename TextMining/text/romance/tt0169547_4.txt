I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice.  Everyone sayingthatit was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go withmovies that nobody likes.  Nevertheless, this one was a certainexception.It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the Americancommunityand about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in thedescriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in thecommunity, habits of behaviour such as "...if you want to succeed, youalways have to seem successful..." or "never stop smiling", parasites ofthecommunity, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are"different", who are "freaky" to some extent; and eventually, there is nocharacter in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to waitfor the very ending of the film, to discover this.With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in themovie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, whilestill remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer.Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who hemet in his life, in the characters described in the film.  Thetragi-comicalevents, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almostevery episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty --the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life;the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of oursepulchre.The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically,coherently,the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and everywordis deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elementsofhumors.  The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a trueindication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellentground for the actors.An amazing movie, strongly recommended.  10/10
