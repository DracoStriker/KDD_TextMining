There are few movies that leave me speechless when the closing creditsroll. This was one of them.The acting was near impeccable by basically every cast member. Thecinematography was very tasteful and delicate. The story was hilarious,haunting, and so beautiful. Along with the many other habits and lifestyles that are generallylooked down upon shown throughout the movie, such as stalking,homosexuality, physical and verbal abuse, vanity, and insecurity, thismovie makes Lester Burnham's lust over a 16 year old girl feelextremely human and almost justifiable. The characters' realness mademe question the morality of a lot of tough subjects.When I heard about this movie, I didn't really know what to expect, butpart of me thought it would just be an entertaining movie about KevinSpacey being attracted to his daughter's friend. This movie was so muchmore. The tagline, "Look closer..." sums up everything about the movieperfectly.
