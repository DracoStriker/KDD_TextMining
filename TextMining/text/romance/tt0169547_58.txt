Well worth seeing, especially if you're a Kevin Spacey fan. Differentthan I expected, but fantastic. A lot of character development throughout, where as I was expecting most to be focused on Spacey, a lot wasspent on all characters which makes the movie all the better. You willnot be disappointed if you decide to watch this movie. Very complexcharacter interactions. Some odd/creepy parts but I think that it givesthe movie its interesting touch and willingness to cross some linesmade it unique. Along with Spacey, Chris Cooper also does a fantasticjob and plays his typical character as a strict military man. AnnetteBenning also was fantastic. Great movie.
