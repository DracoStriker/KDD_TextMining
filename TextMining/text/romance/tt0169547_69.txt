I saw a special preview of the movie tonight. It's true. I laughed. I cried.I saw some things there that I never thought would be there. But, nothinghit me so hard as the ending until 15 minutes after I had left. I had towalk away from the group of people I was with, because I was soflabergasted. I suggest anyone who wants a movie that will *truly* leave youmoved (unlike a certain overhyped with movie), I HIGHLY press "AmericanBeauty" onto you. I will be there many more times.
