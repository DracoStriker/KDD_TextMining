Transcendent. A marvel of a film. There are an astonishing number ofthemes that are each explored and strongly supported by thecinematography, and that makes this film different each time you watchit. I chose to recognize authenticity and redemption as the centralthemes, especially considering the 'look closer' tagline. The smart andsubtle uses of color support several themes, but are also subliminallysubversive. The cinematography in American Beauty and the myriad goalsit accomplishes are nothing short of genius and quite nearly mindcontrol. Mendes' direction here is a staple of self-control andfearlessness in Hollywood. Spacey's performance was shockingly powerfuland resonant. Everything just works, even the mishaps. My only caveat:with so many themes, it feels as though they are wrestling forattention. I felt forced to focus on the satirical aspect of the film,which becomes lacking. It's not that the film is beyond comprehension,rather the themes begin to contradict one another, producing a sort ofunwanted chaotic element that is detrimental to the greater lessons tobe learned. But the achievements in American Beauty cannot be ignored.You can spend days watching this film, trying to wrap your head aroundthe beautiful meaning of life that it presents you with. But it's foryou to determine what that meaning is. Top 500 film. 8/10 ? ?watchingAmerican Beauty.
