Without a doubt, American Beauty is the most overrated movie I have seen.For those of you who have read Joan Didion, this script smacks of Play ItAsIt Lays.What happens when a "typical" suburban professional male realizes hisdissatisfaction with his life? He reacts in an insubstantial andunconvincing way. My job stinks - quit my job. I have troublecommunicatingwith my daughter - smoke dope. My wife is distant and cold - fantasizeaboutanother woman. And so on. Yes, it is Mar-eye-ah cracking a boiled egg onthesteering wheel all over again (Didion reference).Here's the question I really wanted this movie to explore: if, atmidlife,Lester really feels that his life is not what he expected, where does hewant it to go, what will he do about it, and can he get away withit.Sorry, but get religion, join the French Foreign Legion, or start ahome-based business. If you're life is a joke Lester, don't make it worsebybecoming a cliche.
