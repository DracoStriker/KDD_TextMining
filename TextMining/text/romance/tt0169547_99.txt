This has to possibly be one of the greatest.....screenplays of alltime. That's right, screenplays. I didn't much care for the movieitself, but I had an edge: before ever seeing the movie, or knowing whothe actors in the main roles were, I read the screenplay by Alan Ball -and fell in love. The way it was written, the sheer POETRY of thewords, made me want to just sit there and read for the rest of my life.I could physically see the action happening in my head, without evenknowing who played the characters, and every single word was just asimpactful (if not more) than if I had seen it on the big screen.This is an overall EXCELLENTLY written movie, with an incredible plotline and especially the twisted ending. The music also helps to bringout the true emotions of the film, utilizing every millisecond of theinstrumental power provided by the excellent composing skills of ThomasNewman to intensify the raw power of emotion this film possesses. Ilove the script, I ADORE the soundtrack, and I highly recommend this toanyone who has ever listened to any of Thomas Newman's work, or seenany of Alan Ball's scripts.
