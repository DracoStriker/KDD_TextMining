A stellar cast is drawn together for...what? For the biggest load oftripe I've had the misfortune to sit through in a long time.Hmmm...Romantic COMEDY? Laugh...I thought I'd never start - and I wasnot wrong. Not a chuckle, not a titter was raised. Humour of themiddle-class dinner party variety doesn't work for me. Lame, obviousjokes and cartoon characters abound. "Common as muck" Natalie swears infront of the "upper-crust" Prime Minister and we're supposed to find itfunny? Charming? Believable??? PREPOSTEROUS?! LOVE? If Richard Curtis thinks his threadbare characterizations andsuperficial plot lines constitute or represent love in any meaningfulway then he is bonkers, actually.Utter rubbish. Disney for grown-ups.
