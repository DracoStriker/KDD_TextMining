I really liked this film. The opening scene at the Heathrow airport wasexcellent. Such a positive message about love. I very much agreed withit - although the news is usually full of bad and negative stuff andyou can easily get depressed about it - in every day life there is alot of love around us that is not news worthy, although maybe it shouldbe. Also I had this feeling of realizing some deep truth or messagewhen the narrator said that when the twin towers were attacked nobodyin their final moments sent messages of hate - but all messages sentwere messages of love. Obvious, but still..This is a film that youshould see if your are feeling a bit gloomy and need something to cheeryou up.
