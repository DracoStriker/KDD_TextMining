This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Absolute mush with nohint of a backbone in the slightest. It churns on and on and on and on,meandering from one lame contrived story to the next. I rarely get thislittle from a movie, even with most bad films I can at least laugh ATthem but this film just gave me stomach cramps and nausia.I am not the kind of guy that switches off or walks out on a movie so Iregrettably watched to the bitter end. Thinking all along that therewould be a point to it all, that there would be some sort ofresolution, something to make sense of all the lamo, supposedly varied,love stories that are just simply awful.The writing was so bad too, as if it was written by spoilt eleven yearold girl who has been sheltered from everything in life and handedanything she wanted by rich over protective and adoring parents.This film is like a big gooey sugary sweet mess of contrived andpackaged imitation sugar, sprinkled with crap and delivered on a bigplastic pink conveyor belt at the hope of tugging at people's heartstrings.They should have handed out vomit bags in the cinemas.That this film was made is like an insult to anyone who has lived lifefor more than a day in their lives.The people who liked this movie are the people that open spam e mails,they're the people that vote in the Eurovision song contest, the peoplethat stupid signs are made for, the people that don't know anythingabout the world, who read supermarket shelf magazines, the happy to bestupid people. It makes you wonder reading some of the 'reviews' frompeople who liked this are THEY from another planet or is it me?
