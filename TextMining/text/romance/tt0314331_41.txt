I didn't have great hopes from this film following the hype but nothingcould have prepared for the sheer awfulness of dull script, dismalacting,with the noted exception of Emma Thompson, and the constant sense thatyouwere manipulated. I am loathe to waste any more of my life on thisnonsence,suffice to say that if this dross is the best that the British filmindustrycan come up with, then we should hang our heads low and pray for someonetoput it out of it's misery. Mow your lawn, someone else's or deflea thecat,but please do not waste any time on seeing this film; 2 hours of my lifewhich I shall never get back.
