I am going to be honest. For a movie that is supposed to be about love,I felt sick the whole way through. The character development wassuperficial and shallow and the mash-up of numerous haphazard story-lines was sporadic and distracting. I was given no real reason to careabout any of the characters, no real reason to believe that thecharacters actually felt some form of love that extended beyond theirbluntly scripted ego-motives, and I was given no real indication thatany of the relationships actually had real substance. We were shown awacky and contrived selection of insecure puppets blundering throughlife and 'love' like they were on some kind of...movie set. And theblasting pop music really didn't help with the 'ambiance'. Great music,sure, but not while I'm trying to make sense of this desperately drivendialog. And yet...even with the movie-'magic' set-ups and the ever manipulative'twists' of plot, some people commend the movie for being 'realistic',and for showing the 'bad with the good'. OK, first of all, it is farfrom realistic; secondly, the purpose of art is not to show youreality. Scientific reports are the only things that can even get closeto representing reality. Art, however, tells a creative story thatgenerates some sort of effect on its audience. Disgust is not mypreferred way of being 'inspired', and I am still doubting whether thetime it takes to write this review is worth it. So regardless of whatthe movie-makers were aspiring to, all I see this movie doing isencouraging the ill notion that love is some kind of messy sh*t-showthat is impossible to understand or enjoy, but we're all suckers for itanyway. It hurts to say this, but I think the movie-makers were goingfor 'relatable'. Gosh, aren't we all a bunch of desperate suckers?Yeah, great feeling hey? Pretty much the furthest from inspiring thatone can get.And Love, *ACTUALLY*, is inspiring.
