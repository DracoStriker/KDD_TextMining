My sister brought the DVD of Love Actually home for Christmas, claimingshe had seen it somewhere and that it was fantastic. I checked it outand it seemed just...well, you know...like the average romantic comedychick flick hooey-looey horse crap that Hollywood has piled on us forthe last eighteen millenniums. Shrugging it off, I didn't pay muchattention. Well, this New Year's Eve 2006 on the eve of 2007, we hadlots of people over and we all sat down and watched it. Now before Icontinue, anybody who knows me well enough knows that I am an absolutecomplete SUCKER for romantic comedies. It's just that, well, I haven'tfound a good one in a long time! Well, let's just leave it at the factthat I found it, and I hit the jackpot to be honest. Mix the movie"Crash" with "The Breakup" with "Napoleon Dynamite" with "BridgetJones's Diary" with "The Terminal" with "It's a Wonderful Life" with"The Family Stone" and you get LOVE ACTUALLY, the ultimate romanticcomedy as the DVD cover boasts. A multi-plot storyline simply about agroup of unique individuals trying to find love in foggy Londontown atChristmas time, Love Actually features a stellar all-star cast thatincludes many, many well-known actors and actresses. In the movie, youget to experience all kinds of love from a different point of view:love between two hardcore porn stars, a young boy hitting on the mostpopular girl in school, the British Prime Minister and his secretary,an English author and his Portuguese maid, and a million and one otherunlikely combos. The result is clear: a funny, feel-good, heartwarming,and above all romantic movie that all can enjoy...not just the romanticcomedy suckers like me.
