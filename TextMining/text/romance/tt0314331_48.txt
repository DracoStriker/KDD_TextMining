Finally something fresh for Christmas.  Sure, it takes 20 years to determinewhether a film becomes a classic.  Trust me: the ingredients are there:Character chemistry, fresh writing, memorable antics ... It's a feel goodfilm and a mirror for whether you've got the right stuff in your own lovelife.  "Classic," agreed Frank Capra's spirit, "just in time for (every)Christmas."It's the first chick flick (they make no bones about it) that's 2 hours 8minutes long where 'No One' gets killed and 'nothing' explodes that Iactually liked.  Scratch that. ... Loved Actually!If you miss it in the theater (huge mistake), know you'll be seeing it againfor decades to come right around this time of year.  ...enjoy.
