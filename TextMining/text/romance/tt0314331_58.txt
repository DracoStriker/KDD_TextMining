This is a terrific film which follows the lives of several people inGreat Britain. It uses a witty script and fantastic acting to keep theviewer enthralled in the film. Its easy to get lost in the characters.You love some of them so much while hating others to the same amount.Its a very pleasing film, but it does stay true to its name as well asa movie could anyway, it is more like Love Actually. The question iswho will be lucky enough to find it this time around. Some couples ofcourse will find their dreams, while others may have to settle for adifferent kind of love. It opens with a brilliant line delivered byHugh Grant that sets the stage for the film. Enjoy watching this greatBrit Flick.
