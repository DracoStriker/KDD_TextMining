"Love Actually" is fresh, exciting, and utterly brilliant. It could beconsidered a Christmas movie, as it takes place during the Christmasholidays, however I find it to be a refreshing movie to watch at anytime. What's so great about this movie is the complexity of the story,and yet the simplicity of the overall message of the film- which isgiven right up front for all of those who miss it- "Love actually ISeverywhere". I personally think the filmmakers did an excellent job inmaking the story come to life, and the actors a superb job at givingeach character life. Favorite actors in this film, for me, were BillNighy, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, and most especially Emma Thompson &Alan Rickman. I must also sing praises for the production company thiscomes out of- Working Title has come out with some of the best films inthe past few years, and they continue to seem light-years ahead of themajor studios, perhaps because they are willing to take more chances.The only recent movie that ranks near "Love Actually" in my book is"Last Holiday", starring Queen Latifah. I think that romantic comedieslike these two are what we need as a society- an escape from theeveryday into something that seems sweet & more innocent. As time goesby, I think "love actually" will tunnel it way up from the recesses offilm and become one of the most outstanding films of the decade.
