i too did not care at all for this movie. My friend promised me 5 timesi was going to "lovr love love" this movie. He even provided meKleenex, and i never used them once during the course of the 2 (thatactually felt like 5) awful hours, in which i almost fell asleep. Hesaid it was about "love", so i thought i'd give it a try.but sorry to say i just didn't get it. lets see; who loved who? or whowas in lust with who? oh yeah- Emma T's character actually loved herhusband and vica versa. Other than that, no one in this film portrayedanything close to real meaningful love. To me it was very uninspiring.Anyone can lust after a coworker, taking them to bed one time does notconstitute love. 9 year old children don't fall in love with theirpretty little playmates. She had a phenomenal voice though for her age,and I hope to hear more of her in the future.The films recurring, and annoying attempts at comedy and sexualinnuendo (barf) fell flat. where is the humor in 2 disconnected pornstars faking it for the camera???? i failed to find it. I'm not a fanof British humor and this film reeks of it.don't bother to see this film unless you want to watch too manyconfused, uninteresting people sloppily lust after each other. Notreally a feel good kind of movie whatsoever. i wanted to laugh and cryand i did neither. Left me kinda cold.
