This is one of the worst British films ever made and I'm staggered ithas such a good rating here - no accounting for taste I guess. Why isit so bad? It's cloyingly sentimental to the point of beingvomit-inducing: the characters are all middle-class and boring, wrappedup in their own self-obsessed tedium. London is re-imagined as aheavenly place which it isn't. Hugh Grant plays himself yet again - ahthe tedium. The jokes are unfunny. The direction is patronizing andcondescending. It's also too ambitious for its own good. DirectorRichard Curtis has attempted (attempted being the operative word) aromantic comedy that apes the multi-narrative structure of Altman'sShort Cuts. It fails miserably to weave the stories together as Altmandid; instead some stories such as the Laura Linney one remainunresolved as if they don't matter to the overall naffness of thisterrifyingly awful film. The musical segments are alsocringe-inducingly bad. I wish Curtis would have shown some restraint.
