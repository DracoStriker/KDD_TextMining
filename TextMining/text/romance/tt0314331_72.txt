This wasn't just bad, it was despicable. The most sexist movie I'veever seen. Even in the heyday of sexism, movies seemed to at least likewomen, these movie makers don't. Women are derided for looking likewomen (they're FAT!)and depicted as pathetic if they are over 30 orhave careers or are not bimbos. The only successful pairings arebetween men and subservient younger women (sluts or servants)Anti-American in the most obnoxious way, no discussion of meaningfulissues, just American women are sluts and our president is an overtlysinister sleaze who gropes the help (why Americans are posting positivereviews is beyond me. A super slimy Billy Bob Thornton as thepresident!) I haven't seen this movie in two years, I'm actually justremembering how much I hated this from reading these user comments. I'mshocked at the good ones. It wasn't at all funny, the story lines wouldhave been trite for an old American sitcom like Love, American Style orThe Love Boat. Scenes the movie makers apparently thought were funny:juxtaposing a funeral with pornography; having a very young boy whosemother has just died spout four letter words; denigrating the religioustraditions of Christmas. Corny, lame, predictable, unfunny, insulting,and calculated in the most stupid, base way. This movie has it all. Whydo I have to give it a 1, why no 0 score or negative numbers? I'd givethis a -10. I felt sorry for some of the cast, like Laura Linney, goingtopless for this dreck and Hugh Grant who announced hissemi-retirement, I think, around then. I don't blame him.
