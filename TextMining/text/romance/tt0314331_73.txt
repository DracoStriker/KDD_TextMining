I don't know what movie the people who left even a semi-good review forthis pile of crap were watching, because it wasn't Love Actually. The only thing half way good about this movie is the actors... besidesthat, it's unrealistic, offensive, needlessly vulgar (for a"romance"!), written from such a self-righteous point of view. Ahhhh!It's just bad. 1 out of 10. Watch it if you like watching a train wreck and soft-core porn. It'sobvious this writer was listening to all the corniest songs ever whilewriting this movie (Feelings, nothing more than feelings) .... uh! Ijust threw up a little and then swallowed it.
