In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month afterChristmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love. The PrimeMinister (Hugh Grant) and the member of his household, Natalie (MartineMcCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), her husband Harry (AlamRickman) and Harry's secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Harry'semployees, Sarah (Laura Linney), a woman with a serious problem in herlife, and the designer Karl (Rodrigo Santoro); the writer Jamie Bennett(Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz); thegrieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son, Sam; a porn actressand her colleague; the singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) and his manager;the just married couple Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (KeiraKnightley) and their best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln); a British youngman that travels to USA, trying to score women in that country. "Love Actually" is a delightful homage to love. There are differentsituations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching butnever corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing.The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of KeiraKnightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderfulmoments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and theAmerican president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmasgift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret lovefor Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meetsCarol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John;or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe Icould list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader ofmy review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Simplesmente Amor" ("Simply Love")
