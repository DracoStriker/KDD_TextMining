I went to see this movie on a rainy day in an attempt to cheer myself up.Judging by the trailers and reviews, I was expecting a great, feel-goodfilm. What I got was a different story.I got a mangled plot, abandoned storylines, unnecessary sex jokes andswearing, boring one-dimensional characters... And only two people managedto make me laugh- UK TV presenters Ant and Dec. I cared nothing for any of the characters or storylines, save Hugh Grant,but he is wonderful at romantic comedy (pah! this film was not so muchromcom as boringblurb) and I enjoy watching him. What of the porn-stars, whohad plenty of time spent on them at the beginning, only to be abandoned forwhat must have been at least an hour? Kris Marshall, who is brilliant in theUK series "My Family", was given a plot and dialogue so ridiculous I had toshut my eyes and pretend it wasn't happening. Keira Knightley was wooden, asusual, but add that to a messy story and it was bordering onpainful.Even the usually wonderful Alan Rickman was dull. This story seemed to be entirely about sex jokes, swearing and beingunfaithful. After nearly 2 hours, I couldn't bear it any more and left thecinema.Love Actually would've been much better off with half the stories- in fact,no, it would've been better if this diabolical mess had never been made.Atrocious and outstandingly disappointing.2/10 (just for Hugh Grant's "Jump" sequence and Ant + Dec)
