Silly film. A torture to sit through. There is not a single characterwhom I find appealing. Crude, when it could be clever. Obvious, ratherthan truly emotional. The wedding ceremony at the beginning isridiculous, as are many scenes to follow. Being that, for some reason, IMDb will not allow concise reviews, Iwill continue to type until it is deemed I have a lengthy enough post.Well, I will continue to type as many sentences as I can. Hugh Grant asthe prime minister? Gratuitous profanity, that distracted from thedialogue being spoken. Perhaps, not being British, I just don't "getit."Everyone I know loves this film - I am quite puzzled.
