I never gave "Elf" much consideration, and it's not "A Christmas Story"levels of classic, but there's a lot to be said for Will Ferrell in elfbooties roaming wide-eyed the streets of New York City. I guess themovie hinges on that central arrested development innocence vs.modern-day yuletide cynicism, but that ain't a bad thing. Favreausqueezes every funny ounce out of putting Ferrell in small spaces andthe guy really is an endearing spaz. I like the cast, Peter Dinklage isa great easter egg (for lack of a better phrase) and it's just theright dosage of holiday warmth. Sweet, but not stifling.7/10
