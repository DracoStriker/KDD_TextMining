Story-A child raised as an elf at the North Pole is sent to the U.S. toreunite with his dad. Will Ferrell plays the role of innocent and has done a great job in it.This is surely one of his best movie.Movie has many funny moments, likewhen buddy first goes to U.S. he does some stupid things because hedoes not know anything about cities and technologies,dinner scene withhis family.It feels so nice if you can watch a good comedy movie with your familybecause most of the comedy movies cannot be watched with family.I highly recommend this movie for kids and adults if they want to watcha good family movie with comedy and Christmas spirit in it.Overall I give this movie 8/10.
