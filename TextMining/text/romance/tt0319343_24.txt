Elf is directed by John Favreau and starring Will Ferrell and JamesCaan. This is in my top 5 best Christmas movies ever made it has manyhilarious moments and even some sad ones. Although i have to say somemoments are a little bit too much for kids maybe a PG-13 rating wouldbe much better and like i said even tho Will Ferrell is an unfunny anduntalented actor he owns the role in every step of the way as a sillyguy who thinks he is an elf and James Caan is also a great underratedactor who plays his father and judges him most of the time. At the endElf is a great movie and the 6.9 rating i think is a little bit low andit's definitely a great Christmas Movie.
