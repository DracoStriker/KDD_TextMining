'Elf' is probably one of my favorite Christmas films for its funny andsweet and original and did I mention funny yet? I love Will Ferrell andso maybe I'm a bit bias when giving this such a high rating, but Ican't help it. I watch this movie quite a bit and every time I'mreminded of why I love it. The story is about a young orphan who endsup a stow-away one Christmas when he slips out of his crib and slipsinto Santa's big bag of toys. When Santa finds out he has a new guesthe leaves baby duty up to one of the older elves (Bob Newhart) whonever found love and thus never was able to have the children he wantedso badly. When Buddy (Ferrell) gets older though he soon realizes he'snot like the other elves and this sends him on a journey to find hisreal parents. This journey leads him to Walter (James Caan), hisfather, a man who horrifically lands on Santa's 'bad list' year afteryear. The fact that Santa is all but not believed in make it difficultfor anyone, including his own father, to believe Buddy, but the vieweris moved to love him more and more with each passing frame. This is aperfect role for Will, allowing him to tone down his over the topantics (I love those too) and give us a more family friendlyperformance that's as funny as it is charming. As Buddy strives to gainhis fathers love and affection he must also try and resurrect theChristmas Spirit that so many have lost. With great supportingperformances by Zooey Deshanel and Mary Steenburgen, 'Elf' is adelightful holiday film that is sure to please the whole family!
