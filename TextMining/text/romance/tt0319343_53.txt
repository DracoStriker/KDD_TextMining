Elf by my usual standards was not what I would call a good movie. Donotinterpret that the wrong way. I enjoyed watching it very much, and Ihave found myself quoting lines from it for days afterward. It justdidn't have the substance that movie needs for me to classify it asgood. Will Ferell was great as Buddy the Elf. While I watched this movie Ifound myself wishing I could be as carefree and innocent as thecharacter Buddy is in this movie. Granted he didn't know any better,but that's part of the humor. I think everyone wishes they could bemore like Buddy to a degree, and that's whatmakes this movie so charming.The length of this movie was rather short, but that's probably a goodthing.Charming and cute though this movie was, any longer than 95 minutes andIwould've made up an excuse to leave. Overall I think it might become a Christmas classic, but maybe not oneto watch every year.7 out of 10 stars
