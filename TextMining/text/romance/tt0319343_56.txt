After seeing "Elf" last night (special preview screening) I am happy tosaythat I, as well as my children left the theater feeling full of Christmascheer. I do believe that this movie will become a Christmas classic. I cansee this movie being viewed by millions each year on TV just like "AChristmas Story", and "It's a Wonderful Life". Was the movie perfect? No.Will it win an Oscar? Of course not. Did it make me laugh, and feel goodwhile looking forward to another Christmas this year. Without a doubt.7 out of 10 Stars.
