Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the NorthPole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biologicalfather--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfullywalking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. WillFerrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass ofcurly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easilybe used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau'shandling of "Elf" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naivecharacter Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the sillypranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he'sassembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back hisstar, though some may find the climactic moments (involving EdwardAsner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainlyfunnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects arekept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's notonly refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****
