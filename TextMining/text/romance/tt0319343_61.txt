A Wonderful Movie For All Ages"Elf" is one of the best holiday movies I have ever seen. It is ahilarious comedy that is great for all ages. The director Jon Favreaudid a fantastic job with the plot line, comedy, and casting the rolesfor this movie. Buddy the elf played by Will Ferrell is really whomakes this movie though.For example this movie is about a baby orphan named Buddy(Will Ferrell)who finds his way into Santa's sack on Christmas Eve and is then raisedas and elf in the North Pole. As Buddy (Will Ferrel) grows up herealizes he is different from the other elves and Santa finally thinkshe is old enough to know he is not an elf and that his real dad livesin New York City. Buddy ( Will Ferrell) then goes on a quest to findhis father (James Caan) who does not know he exists, but his elf likequalities don't exactly fit in in New York City. This movie is a greatholiday movie with a fun plot line.In addition, to a good plot line this movie also has hilarious comedy.On Buddy's journey to find his dad he is oblivious to everything goingon around him. He has this cheerful enthusiastic attitude every wherehe goes and it makes this movie hilarious and an amazing experience towatch.Although many people may think this is not one of Will Ferrel's bestperformances, this might be because they are used to his usual roles inmore adult type movies. Elf is a great movie for all ages and isespecially good for families. When you watch it you can just feel theChristmas spirit surrounding you.Furthermore, I believe the actors that were casted in this movie hadthe perfect personalities for their roles. They all did a outstandingjob and they are what make this movie so good. All of them put a lot ofeffort into their roles and play them very well.In conclusion, this movie is one of my all time favorite Christmasmovies and will be shown on TV for the rest of our lives. I alsobelieve it will become a classic that our kids will watch in thefuture. This is a need to see Christmas movie.
