I never had the urge to watch Elf. I saw the adverts, thought it anover-americanised piece of tacky, vulgar crap. So when my music teacherdecided she was going to make us watch it, I wasn't looking forward toit. The fact she claimed to have watched it 6 times since buying it,before I saw it, was worrying, and the fact she wanted to show it toher GCSE music class was just as odd. But she had bought us chocolatelogs (there are only 10 people who take music) so we all settled downto watch it ("if anyone asks, we're studying film music!").And wow. I mean wow. This film was one of the funniest and mosttouching films (considering what I thought it would be) that I'd everseen. There are so many scenes that made me laugh out loud to count.And I can truthfully say that at certain points at the end, our entireclass went "awww!" (the fact that we're all girls shouldn't factor intothis.) The advert for this film doesn't do it justice at all. There's aplenty of humour in it to satisfy any adult (or 16-year old) as well asthe kiddie laughs.Will Ferral makes this film what it is. His child-in-a-grown-mansperformance is admirable and everyone said that they would marry himjust for his sweetness in this film. That said, Zooey Deschanelssnarling attitude definitely brought a satisfying ring to the film,with her witty put downs of Buddy the Elf and her portrayal of 'teenangst' is fantastic.Watch this. Recommend is not a strong enough word for how much I wantpeople to watch it! Just watch it, OK?
