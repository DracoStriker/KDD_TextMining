"Elf" is a very boring movie.Will Farrel has no talent.Did this movie even have a script? If so, did anyone read it? Why is notalent John Favreu directing a movie? Someone paid a lot of money tomake this movie, the money would have been better spent feedinghomeless people.I know bad movies exist, I get it, what I don't understand is therecent phenomenon of how a piece of crap like "Elf" and many other badmovies can actually make a profit and how people tell you how much theylove these movies that you know without a doubt totally suck.I miss the old days when bad movies would just totally flop and die. Ifpeople keep seeing bad movies Hollywood will keep making them.Please stop spending money on bad movies and force Hollywood to makegood movies, I like good movies and refuse to watch garbage."Elf" is pure garbage.
