Okay, I realize that this is just a comedy, but it is VERY uncomfortable tosit and watch a grown man continually act infantile over the course ofninety minutes.  I ended up feeling as uncomfortable as the characters inthe movie seeing him play with toys, gorge on a 100% sugar-laden diet, andwearing that irksome costume.  I went in with an open mind, and am normallyvery forgiving of movies that aren't necessarily my type, but this just mademe squirm in my seat in a way few recent movies have.  I know the criticsdid not like "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" three years ago.  To me, thiswas worse.  This movie was redeemed by Zooey D. and Ed Asner's great Santaperformance, but that's it.  Farrell, I wanted to smack, and I liked him onSNL.  Consider yourselves warned.
