Well,after experiencing the disappointing Matrix. I was hoping Elf wouldlift my spirits up greatly. But my hopes were diminished.You all are familar with the plot by now so I won't go intothat.I just didn't like this film,mostly because Will Ferrell's funny bits,asmuch as I TRIED to laugh,weren't funny. The plot in general just seemedsuperficial and boring. I wouldn't recommened this to anyone either,maybebefore when I was looking forward to the movie.
