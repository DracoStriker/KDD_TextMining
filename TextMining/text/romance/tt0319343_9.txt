Elf (2003)I sure wish they would have released this movie in December, it would havegiven it an even Christmas-ier spirit to it all. Elf was a hilarious movieabout a guy named Buddy (Will Ferrel), who was raised by elves at the NorthPole. He then discovers he isn't an elf, and travels to New York city tofind his real father (James Caan). It turns out his that Buddy has astepbrother and a stepmother (Mary Steenburghen). While there, he meetsJovie (Zooey Deschanel) at a store there, and falls in love. This movie isall about Christmas spirit and is wonderful and enjoyable. It's a greatfamily movie. You should take you ands your family to it during the holidayseason. This will be one of those Christmas movies that I will be able towatch over and over. I give Elf a 10/10.
