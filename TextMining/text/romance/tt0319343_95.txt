Elf will definitely make it down in this generation's list of Christmasclassics. Growing up, although the original classic Christmas movieshold a nostalgic place in my heart, I've been fed up watching them timeand again, year after year.Elf was a new addition and a great one at that. Will Ferrell plays thepart of an elf exploring the world outside of the North Pole in searchfor his biological family. The cast does a great job of eliciting joy,emotion, and humour from viewers throughout the entire film, and itmakes for a great family film.I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking to add to their listof Christmas movies to watch, if it hasn't already been added.
