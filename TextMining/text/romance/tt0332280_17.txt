...You may cry out due to complete boredom and instances of suddenoutbursts of laughter due to this movie's all-round stupid andunrealistic plot. Just so sad to see two fabulous, classic actorsaccept supporting roles in a poorly written movie; with countlessobvious mistakes, many being historical in nature; from a terriblebook.I think if they had a different writing team, different researchers!,and ditched those two awful youth actors (who belong in teen flicks andthose stupid giant lizard and shark movies on the Sci-Fi channel), themovie may have been good if the focus was on the late stages of theirlife and not the early. When they were young, it was all totallyunrealistic cloudy rolls in the hay, giant rivers filled with birds anda wet sundress contest and pouty fights. But the roles Gena Rowlandsand James Garner were totally different and could really make a wondermovie.The many historical flaws were very distracting. Such as her jewelrystyles. The types of pearls a betrothed upper class girl at her agewere totally wrong. Also the lack of progression of the fashionsthrough the decade of their youth is wrong especially for someone w/money.Unusually, I would say read the book, but that was just as bad. Myrecommendation is watch a different movie! Oh and I SO totally agreewith dallas_viewer 's review! This person hit it on the nose! Alsokj_justice 's review is spot on except for the Disney comment. SappyDisney romance is one kind I always love! :-)
