I found this movie offensive, It's popularity is telling of the selfishdelusional expectations and lack of consideration for anybody otherthan the couple, in fact the couples happiness should be at the expenseof every other person, even when they are portrayed in good character.Unlike other "love story / chick flick" components to movies such astitanic etc, the guy she left, who she also happened to be unfaithfulto, for her "true love", was portrayed as a nice guy throughout themovie. No sympathy was attributed to this guy even though his loss wasat the expense of her.Another example of this was shown that the couple had 4 childrenranging from young teen to adult. When the movie ended with the pair ofthem in bed both expiring at the same time, several people claim thiswas a happy event (a good way to go). Well it is for the 2 people,rather the one that would not have outlived the other and thus wouldnot suffer the loss. However, they are not the only 2 people in theworld, there were 4 children. I have had the misfortune of losing aparent. If I lost both at the same time, I don't think I would havethought that was such a happy event. This is another example of thefocus on the "love / romance" at any cost to others. This happens in alot of movies, but normally it happens less and the loss is to the "badguy".It goes to show how most women in our society (primarily at a youngage) will over value (to say the least) the "love / romance" (if youwant to call it that) at the expense of anybody else's happiness - evenwhen they are portrayed as good characters.
