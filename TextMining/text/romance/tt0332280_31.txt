OK,you might find this unusual,but if you are a hater of this movie andChick Flicks in general(like me),then you won't be surprised.Infact,you might be delighted.See,i'm a 12 year old girl and i HATE chickflicks,because they are so sappy,unrealistic,uninteresting,WAY toocliché,and it gets to your head if you don't watch it.And when girlsfall for this ****,they will start making their own fantasy about howlife and love is,which will ultimately go wrong.Every time my mom andsisters talk about Chick Flicks,it makes me gag.They always say it isthe best movie ever which i know for a fact that neither of thosemovies the deem as "the best movie ever" are no match to "Casablanca"and "The Godfather".Since i was bored,i decided to look into the bad reviews of this moviesince i love bad reviews since they are so funny and spot on and ifound myself laughing in delight at all of the jokes about how awfuland predictable this film was and how i wasn't the only one that hatedthis film.I knew i wasn't the only one,i couldn't have been the onlyone,but still.So,when i was reading the reviews,i started thinking,whynot do one of my own?Since i love doing reviews.And i never tried a badone before either!So,this is where the review comes in.I'll start saying how i first sawthis.My mom just took the movie form our grandma,she had a strokerecently at the time,so we just took the film anyway.We were all sopsyched and i was psyched because i thought i would finally see a goodmovie.I couldn't have been more WRONG!First of all,like all Chick Flicks,the story,if there actually wasone,was boring,unoriginal,uninteresting,and the worst of themall,predictable and cliché.A boy and girl fall in love,they are bothvery different but still in love,then the parents separate them,andthey still love each other of course.They don't even really try tocontact each other other than Noah that f****** p**** writing 365unanswered letters a year.Why didn't Allie write to him,huh?Didn't sheLOVE HIM?!If she did,she didn't love him THAT much.The characters areextremely one dimensional,have no depth whatsoever,i really couldn'tcare less what happened to them.Besides James Garner and Gena Rowlands,the acting was so horrible andforced.Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were so annoying andunconvincing as the shallow characters.They had NO chemistrywhatsoever(If you want to see AMAZING chemistry,REAL chemistry,watchHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in "To Have and Have Not",and you caneasily see the difference between good chemistry and bad).Noah(RyanGosling) irritated me the out of all the characters cause he was thetypical boring,uninteresting,shallow,and so called "sweet" boy,i meanseriously,no girl in her right mind would date him,in fact,some peoplemight even think he's hiding in the closet somewhere.Seriously,when itcomes to a heterosexual relationship-there only needs to be ONE*****,not TWO!What irritates me most is that my mom and sisters LIKEthat kind of guy.I mean seriously,my mom and one of my sisters weretalking about my sis' ex-boyfriend and after mom said maybe he was too"bad" for her,she suggested that she date someone like "that guy in TheNotebook",and right then and there,i rolled my eyes.Guys like thatare,what i said,******!Rachel McAdams was irritating as Allie with allher screaming and ****,if she were in a Beatles concert,she would havebeen PERFECT.Now Rachel McAdams isn't a bad actress,she was good in"Mean Girls" and "Wedding Crashers",but she was just irritating in thismovie.Maybe that's the scripts fault.And besides,the movie was barely about a notebook except for the firstand last five minutes in the film.They might as well have called it"Not Another ****** Chick Flick".Plus Nicholas Sparks' books are a piece of **** anyway,they are allpreachy and predictable and basically the same **** kind of story overand over and over again.Read Ian McEwan,his stories are much morebetter,convincing,in depth,and realistic and everything else TheNotebook isn't.I'll probably edit this review another time,but just listen what isay:Don't Watch Chick Flicks Unless You Are Going To Believe In It LikeFairy Tales.
