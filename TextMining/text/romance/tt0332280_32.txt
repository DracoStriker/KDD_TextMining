I started off this movie, anticipating a great watch as depicted by thevery high rating. Much to my disappointment, the movie failed toimpress. It is a typical love story, where you already know the ending.A stereotypical rich girl / poor boy madly in love story... where thesociety pulls them apart. Performances by Ryan Gosling was okay butRachel Mc Adams failed to impress, seemed to me all her scenes wereoverly done, with extreme anger or extreme opposite.All in all, do not anticipate a classic movie here or you will bedisappointed. I might have enjoyed the story better if I was notexpecting it to be a classic.
