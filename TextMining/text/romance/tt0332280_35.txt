I hesitated to watch this movie for almost 2 years until I got into theNetflix club and saw a little of the movie. I then couldn't wait toreceive it by mail but instead, I ran out to the Video store and rentedit. It was only a dollar to rent but I can sure say one thing. It wasthe best dollar that I ever spent. I never had a movie that moved menor made me shed so many tears and as soon as my wife came in fromshoping, I told her that its a must see movie and then started to tellher the who story. Before you knew it, I was at the end and stillcrying. I am one of those guys that don't easily get moved by moviesbut this one got to me. Don't get me wrong, It was tears of joy with alittle taste of sorrow all thru out.You will love it! I promise.
