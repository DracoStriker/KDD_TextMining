Outstanding! As predictable as the plot may appear, this is one of thegreatest love stories ever told on the silver screen; it will melt thehardest of hearts. Don't bring a hankie, bring a towel. The screenplayas well as the adaptation portrayed by the actors was superb. This wasnot a movie on my RADAR at all; my wife selected it because shepreviously planned to read the book. What a wonderful surprise. I'venever formalized my opinion of a movie before, but I felt it was myduty this time around to include my comments in hopes it mightinfluence someone else to see this wonderful movie. If you're in love,or looking for the definition of love, this is a must see movie!
