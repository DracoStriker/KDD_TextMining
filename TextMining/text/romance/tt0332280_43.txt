I have now seen this move at least 4 times due to having the Starsmovie pack. This movie is worst than the English Patient. I'm tellingyou this movie has not just bad. You never have any doubt about whatwill happen and it is just so cheesy.Don't watch this movie. I'm telling you it will turn your brain tosalad.This is coming from a person who has watched every bad movie there is.I have seen Gigli about six times - again thanks to Stars Movie Pack. Iwould watch Giggle five more times before seeing one five minute partof the Notebook. However, I gave this move a vote of 2 instead of 1,because I am saving that vote for the future. With are ever growningtechnolgoy I bet that someone will someday be able to create a moveworst than this one.Thanks, David.
