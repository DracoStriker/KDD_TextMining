I read the book sometime ago. I read "A Walk to Remember" and loved it,so I figured I'd read this one. I didn't care for it, and when themovie came out, I tried to watch it, thinking it would be better thanthe book. I think I tried watching this movie twice, and it just didnothing for me. Good thing I rented this movie; it would've stunk if Ibought it and weren't able to return it. Nicholas Sparks' novels havemade better movies than this one. It just seemed so fairy tale to me;that doesn't happen in real life. I found it to be boring, and I didn'teven watch the whole thing. Just couldn't; it seemed to drag like aboring class you have to take. Altho I read more of his books and lovedthem, this one was my least favorite.
