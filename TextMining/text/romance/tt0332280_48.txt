One of the many problems with this movie is the implausibility andpredictability of the story (maybe that's two of the many problems!).Girl takes up with guy from the wrong side of the tracks. They areseparated by her parents and by war; she takes up with a worthy suitor;but she eventually returns to his arms. Kind of Titanic minus the ship,the icebergs and most of what made that movie so good. They livehappily ever after until she winds up with dementia in the ArnoldSchwarzenneger Home for Retired Very Wealthy Californian Gentlefolk andforgets everything, including him. He jogs her intermittently back intothe present by reading from a mysterious book which is (hey, we wouldnever have guessed that!) their story. They dance, just like they usedto, and indulge in heart-shredding exchanges of the 'I will alwayslurve you' variety. There is a point about 10 minutes from the end whenyou think (with relief) that the movie is over. It certainly would havebeen a good place to stop; there's nothing more to add to the story.But no. The director has to go on and rub in the schmaltz just in casewe thought the movie might display some subtlety. The guy wangles hisway past the night attendant at the Home and into his dementedpartner's bed where they expire together. A perfect ending - for them,perhaps, but not for us. Not a movie for grownups. Don't waste yourmoney.
