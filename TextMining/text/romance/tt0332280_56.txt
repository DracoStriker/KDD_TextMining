This movie was without question the best love story ever told.Yes I cried bucket of tears.I only wish every husband and wife could watch this together, my wifeand I had a box of Kleenex on the bed, and used up the whole box.Being someone who works with people that are sometimes not there, Iunderstand losing touch.I see it every day, and see spouses that have lost touch with theirlove of their life.The Notebook was incredible.Regards, Dr. Bob
