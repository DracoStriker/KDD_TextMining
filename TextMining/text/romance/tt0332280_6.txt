I am a big fan of love stories. Lately, the film industry has beenlacking the sort of element that I love to see in a movie. The lastmovie I saw that made me cry as much as "The Notebook" did was "Ghost"with Demi Moore. The casting of Allie and Noah in the movie wasexceptional and made the feelings and emotions seem real. Afterwatching the movie in the theater, I noticed every person, includingthe men, cry as they left the theater. Now when was the last time yousaw anything like that?? I bought the movie on DVD the day it came outand have been watching it everday since that day!! I would highlyrecommend this movie to both males and females.
