"The Notebook" (2004) has something absolutely amazing - the beston-screen chemistry between two young lovers who are crazy about eachother, whose love is so real, so overwhelming, so tender and passionatethat you actually forget that they are acting. Ryan Gosling and RachelMcAdams are sensational. Since I saw Ryan in his controversial "TheBeliever" (2001), I always wait for his next film. I believe that he'sgot a great future. McAdams was radiant- just to think that the firstmovie I saw her in was Rob Schneider's "Hot Chick" (yes, I rented it).Her work in "The Notebook" made me think that for many young (and notso young) artists the biggest problem is not the lack of talent but thechance to find the right material and the right director who can makethe best of their abilities. I like the movie. I believe it deserves its tears. It really made methink of Woody Allen's words, "If you want to make God laugh, tell himabout your plans". Even if the plans are as simple as to live happilyever after. 8/10
