I loved this movie!!! I am not ashamed to say that I cried my eyes outduring it! I just watched it tonight, and am already in love with RyanGosling (Noah). He is an amazing actor!!! Although, I do have to admit,he looks a lot better when he doesn't have a beard or anything. Him andRachel (Allie) should definitely do more movies together you could justfeel the chemistry between them!!! Great movie!! WARNING: If you're assappy as I am (which I'll admit is pretty sappy) you'll cry 75% of themovie, so get ready to have a box of tissues handy!!! But don't worry!!Half the time it is a happy cry!! You also might want to take a breakduring the movie or you'll have so many tears that they just won'tstop!!
