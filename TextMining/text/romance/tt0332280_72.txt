Unless you easily cry, you won't be totally moved by this movie.I can't see why it's a big deal. The storyline is generic, the lovescene with the rain is generic, and the whole thing is verymelodramatic. I can sum up the whole movie in one sentence: Boy meetsgirl, they fall in love, parents disapprove, they get together in theend. If you're into soap operas, you'll love this, because it practically isone. I almost laughed at some of the overly dramatic scenes.The only good thing I could say about this movie is the visual effect,because the design and costuming was gorgeous.
