I just viewed this movie last night, as part of a $5 bet with a girl.She told me she would pay me $5 if I did not like the movie. Since shehad been right before, most notably with the enjoyable Bill Murrayvehicle LOST IN TRANSLATION, I decided to give this one a try.My verdict? Standard "chick flick" with the obligatory tear-jerkingmoments. Unusually predictable storyline even for a woman's movie,standard to substandard acting, and obviously fake facial hair whichprovides an unintentional comic distraction. While it was pleasant tosee the former YOUNG HERCULES star trying a dramatic role, he lookedlost without his companions from that show, and possibly a good fightscene to liven up the plot. Of course, if it contained a good fight, itwouldn't be a "chick flick" - would it guys?It is not a bad film, and it has a good message. Trust me though - Iwas happy to collect the $5 at the end, and that made the whole eveningworthwhile. Skip this film - unless you're trying to impress a girl ofcourse.
