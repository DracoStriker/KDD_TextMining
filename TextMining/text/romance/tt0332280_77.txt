This is one of the rare times I have read, and deeply enjoyed, a novelshortly before seeing a film adaptation (of which I had not been awareuntil noticing it in the local video shop). In comparison to the novel,this film was such a disappointment. In my opinion, a travesty.My wife and I agreed (and that is a fairly rare event in our appraisalof films!) that the casting of all the leading roles, without exception(except Noah's father, who didn't even figure in the novel!), wasinappropriate and unsympathetic, and that the special qualities thatmade this short and economically written book so touching and memorablewere lost in the film version. Even the house shown in the film was notall evocative of the one Noah had restored. Above all the descriptionsand mood created around Noah on the river at sunrise, and the magicaltrip leading to the 'bird lake', such powerful images in the book, andof his poetry, were played down to a minimal level.It was as if the task of adaptation to screen was handed to someone whokept only the title and bare outline of the story and then proceeded tocreate a different, and vastly inferior and less powerful work.What a shame The Notebook has not enjoyed a truly sympathetic orsensitive adaptation like The Bridges of Madison County, EnchantedApril or even the recent Ladies in Lavender. The power of the noveldeserved this. Perhaps a European director (or Clint Eastwood) wouldhave done it more justice.A missed opportunity.
