I really hate it when something like this happpens, you have a movie, withan amazing story, with unlimited potential, and then Hollywood has to go andscrew it up by casting it with teen "hearthrobs". There is so much wrongwith this movie it's not even funny. Small stuff that anyone making a movieshould know, most of it's just common sense. Ryan Gosling was wrong for thispart for a number of reasons, the part needed a good actor. He had aboutthree emotions in the movie, "smile", "loving anger", and "lonley". That'sall. The role should be contended for best actor at the Academy Awards, butthey had to give it to someone based on looks, it's ridiculous. James Garnerand Gene Rowlands were just pathetically fake. Their acting was so over thetop and so bad it made me laugh several times in the movie. This movie has avery good story, but it was ruined by Hollywood. Who knows, maybe in 20years they will remake it with better actors, hopefully.
