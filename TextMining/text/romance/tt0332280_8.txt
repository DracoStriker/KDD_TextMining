This story plays out as Duke, played by James Garner, reads a storyabout two young people in the 1940s who fall in love and endure life.The movie moves between present-day and the 1940s. It is structurallyvery similar to "Fried Green Tomatoes", which is also one of my alltime favorite movies.Unlike "Fried Green Tomatoes", this focuses on young love as it growsand endures through wars and parental dissent. Sure, the core is the"Romeo and Juilet" theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptionalcharisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and notentirely predictable. This is a deeply romantic movie. If you arecynical at all about romance, timeless love and dedication to anotherperson, you may find yourself rolling your eyes a bit. I am not thatcynical about the emotional ties that bind us and I was thoroughlytaken in by the story.This is such a gentle movie. The characters are very human and verylikable. All of the actors turn in engrossing and compellingperformances.Technically, this movie is exceptional, too. The scenes during theopening credits is absolutely breathtaking. The editing is very good.The story is compelling from the opening credits to the closingcredits.My wife and I don't always share the same perspective on movies, but weagreed on this one. We both loved it immensely. I am certain this willbecome part of our permanent collection.
