My husband and I watched this with another couple. All four of usreally enjoyed the movie. It is a wonderful movie that I will recommendto everyone I know. I must admit that I'm not normally a "cryer", but Ihighly recommend that no one watch this film unless you have a steadysupply of tissues close at hand. *****SPOILER???****(this is my firstcomment on this site, so I don't know if this is a spoiler or not???Better to be safe and mark it so)I loved the scene when Noah took Allie to the old mansion for the firsttime, and even though they wanted to "prove their love", he was stillgentleman enough to say that she didn't have to go through with it ifshe wasn't ready and that he could wait...that's more indicative oftrue love instead of just some hungry male trying to get in her pants.I loved, loved, loved this movie...but I didn't understand why hermother would keep all those letters. IF she really desperately wantedNoah out of her daughter's life, then why wouldn't she have destroyedthem on the spot? And weren't there inconsistencies with hair colors?Did anyone notice? ********All in all, minor discrepancies aside,this is a must see. For all ages,men and women will love this film. I will certainly add this to my DVDcollection.
