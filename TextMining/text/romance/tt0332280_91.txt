I went with a girl friend to this movie and we both groaned and laughed(derisively)through this romantic slush. However, the girl friend whorecommended this movie had it down as one of her all time favourites -so why the differing opinions? Basically if you enjoy escapism throughromance and a happy ending is a must, then this is the movie for you.If you are cynical as far as love and romance is concerned then forgetit. The litmus test is ... if you like 'Love Story' you'll enjoy this.The acting is good and the story develops slowly but surely but thesubject of the story is purely romance and if you have no interest inthis then basically this film is boring.
