After reading the book, the movie was a disappointment. In movies,usually the things that are changed are scenes and little twists but inthis film they have changed the behavior of the characters, fromawesome gentle people to social idiots. The way they have changed thebehavior of the characters was a huge disappointment. The movie wasn'teven close to what the book was portraying, the main theme to ending,everything is changed. The movie had no depth and it seems like a B-class romcom.
