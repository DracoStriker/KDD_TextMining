While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made willever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie isvery well done. I read many reviews going either way, but I must say Ienjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Mac'sperformance saying he didn't do a good job. I thought he was fine, butbelieve me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible inthe film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance.Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi,like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.If you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may notlike it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but thenagain it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movieeasily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, andthe score is perfect.One warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more thanAusten's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that.But overall I thought it was a great film.
