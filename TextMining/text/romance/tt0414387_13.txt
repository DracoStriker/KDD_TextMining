Pride and Prejudice was an absolutely fantastic film. A great cast, andKeira Knightly did an excellent job and Matthew Macfadyen was awonderful in the role of Mr Darcy. The cinematography was soridiculously good, there were some fantastic shots and the costumeswere also fantastic. The script was fairly good, it is true to theclassic by Jane Austen, Mr Wickam could have made more of anappearance, and had a striking resemblance to one Orlando Bloom. Themovie moved fairly fast but trying to fit such a novel into two hourshad to be hard anyway, so I say well done to all involved, as such abeloved book can be a hard project to take on, but after watching it Ireally can't wait until to see it again!!!
