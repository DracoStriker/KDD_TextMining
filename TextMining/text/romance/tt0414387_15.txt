Maybe if you've never read any English literature or only ever watchedthe Hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awfulfilm. It has the directorial and scripting skill of Shoreditch. The BBC1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book andcaptures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well.The characters in this production are badly miscast, Sutherland asBennet seems a total buffoon. Bingley likewise acts the fool and it isimcomrepnsible that he my be a friend of Darcy. I can't imagine howJudi Dench could have accepted the role, maybe she thought it was asurreal comedy version.Quotes from the book are thrown in out of context. Huge chunks aremissing, the important episode with Wickham is glossed over.Mr Collins is however very good, and towers above the other members ofthe cast.The only good thing is we didn't pay to see it. Wait for the DVD anduse to keep a table from wobbling.
