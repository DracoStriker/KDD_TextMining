This film is bad. There are no words that do justice to what this filmhas done to the most beloved work of one of the greatest Englishauthors. To start with, the film cannot seem to decide when it is set.We see scenes and costumes from a plethora of different historicalperiods (especially in the ballroom scenes). This is nothing to thedialogue, however, which cannot decide if it wants to be modern orself-consciously antiquated. Apparently just using Austen's dialoguewould be too easy. The characters' manners wouldn't fit into any period(see Georgianna Darcy in particular). The scene of Darcy's secondproposal appears to have been stolen from a Mills and Boon novel. I canonly imagine that the makers of this film have never read the book orwere just having a laugh. Even the acting doesn't redeem it, as evengreat performers collapse under an absurd script. The two leads areparticularly bad as they attempt to smoulder. Please do not go to seethis film, as giving them money would only serve to encourage this sortof thing.
