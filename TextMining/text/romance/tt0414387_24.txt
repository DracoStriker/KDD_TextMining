There are many, including prominent professional critics, who commendthis adaptation of "Pride and Prejudice" for its "realistic" portrayalof dirt, unkempt clothes and hair, farm animals wallowing in the livingroom, etc. In fact, it is not only historically unauthentic, it isfalse to Jane Austen. There were no such scenes of squalor included inthe novel. To the contrary, Austen wrote a passage in which ElizabethBennet sets out on a long walk after a rain storm to visit her ailingsister, during which she soils the hem of her skirt with mud. Thisslight soiling results in a small amount of embarrassment forElizabeth, who tries to let down her outer garment to hide it, and agreat amount of derision behind her back by two nasty female residentsof the house she is visiting. Had dirt and shabbiness been the norm inhouseholds like Elizabeth's at the time depicted, it is unlikely alittle mud on the edge of a skirt would have attracted anyone's noticeor rude commentary, and these events in the book would have made nosense. The fact that Austen wrote such a scene and had the charactersbehave as they do indicates that cleanliness and neatness of dress werenormal and expected at that place and time, among that class of people.
