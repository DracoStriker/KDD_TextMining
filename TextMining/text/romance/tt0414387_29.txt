I am a great lover of Austen's works, especially Pride & Prejudice. The1995 miniseries is so faithful to the novel its astounding. The actorsare well chosen, there isn't modernized language thrown in, and eachemotion is handled well. You can't help having your heart skip a beatwhen Elizabeth and Darcy finally realize they both love each other. Youhate Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst. But in this latest adaption, itshard to swallow. There is no Mrs. Hurst. The Bennett family look muchpoorer than they are. Elizabeth walks/dresses/acts in a manner soagainst what women of that time would. Yes, Elizabeth Bennet isunconventional, but more in the fact that she is not afraid to expressher opinions. She is, however, socially capable and proper in the wayshe carries herself, dresses, etc. In this, Keira walks around incruddy clothes, and acts as though she should be down on the farm inthe Midwestern USA. The scene where Elizabeth and Darcy "can't sleep"drove me insane. SHe would never walk out in that! The scene whereBingley just enters Jane's room as well...he would never have donethat! If you haven't read the novel or seen the 1995 adaption, you'dprobably love this movie. But those who love the novel or love theadaption (or both) will be very disappointed. Why there was a need toadapt this novel again, I don't know. I have nothing left to say. Iknow Austen would be very unhappy should she be able to see this latestmovie.
