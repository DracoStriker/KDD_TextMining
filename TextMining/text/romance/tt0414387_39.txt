I didn't see any reason to make another adaptation of PnP after thebrilliance of the 1995 mini series unless they are going to make anexcellent job and sadly they didn't.The film rushed through at an alarming pace without really getting toknow any character. It was slightly sugar coated with complete lack ofthe classic wit of Jane Austen. The Bennet Family looked poorer thanthey should. KeiraKnightley's portrayal of Lizzy Bennet is too modern.She grimaces and grins every scene and came across as being soobnoxious. There was no indication that she was witty, particularlyintelligent or specially attached to either Jane or her father.Thegirls giggled a lot.Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet is a disaster. MrsBennet is less awful than JA intended.Mr Bingley was played as acomplete idiot for cheap laughs. Mathew MacFadyen is more vulnerablethan proud,there was no strength of personality. He does not possessthe same air of dignity as Colin Firth.This is obviously more of a serious film and the wit and humour of JaneAusten was almost lost in favour of all the melodrama. The best thingabout the film is the many pretty English country side.
