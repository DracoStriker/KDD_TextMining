I first have to say that Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of myfavorite novels, to compare this movie to the novel isincomprehensible, Jane Austen would be rolling over in her grave atthis thought. I was expecting something as wonderful as the A&Eversion, and received a poorly acted piece of trash. Elizabeth is astrong character with slight nuances that intrigue; Keira Knightleyshowed little enthusiasm for the character, actually she had the samefacial expression throughout the entire movie.The final impression of the movie is that it was purely to show offKeira Knightley, with superfluous scenes of her looking pensive (butsomehow pensive looks the same as anger, happiness, and love...interesting). Even the most touching scenes seemed forced from allcharacters. If you must watch this movie, rent it, but if you wouldlike to enjoy Pride and Prejudice, rent the A&E version with CollinFirth, now he is a real Mr. Darcy!
