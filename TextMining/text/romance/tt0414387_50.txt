After seeing the BBC miniseries version of this, I am completely takenback by this version, and not in a good way. They jumped from storylineto storyline, added too much drama, strayed from the book too much andeven COPIED the BBC miniseries version! they copied it in ways such as:the nether field ball - Mary is supposed to be so accomplished, not badat singing at all. the BBC miniseries version added that part in forinterest, and then this current version COPIED that, which wasn't inthe book at all. Also, a lot of the wording wasn't taken from theoriginal book, but just the previous TV version. They crammedeverything into too short a space of time and got the architecture allwrong. they skipped characters out (such as Mr and Mrs Hurst and theGardiner's' children) and added humor into the story where the book didnot indicate it. This is a minor detail, but I couldn't believe it wheni saw it: Caroline actually wore NO SLEEVES only thin straps! i haveresearched the era of Jane Austen thoroughly and i can tell you thatthey NEVER did that. NEVER. it would be seen as so rude. i thought theacting woeful. Keira knightly copied Jennifer Ehle thoroughly and washopeless. the Mr Darcy in it was arrogant, but not proud at all, whichwas his main problem! everyone rushed through their lines and were soplastic that i could be sick. i give the makers credit, they didcontain feeling. but it was the WRONG feeling. EVERYTHING wasDRAMATISED.overall, the whole thing was hopeless. it was such an insult to theimmortal Jane Austen's writing and i shall always remember the makersof the movie and the actors in the movie, ESPECIALLY KEIRA KNIGHTLY WHOWAS TERRIBLE with the utmost anger for ruining this completelyharmless, sophisticated and magical story and turning it into a SHAM. Ido not recommend ANYONE to watch it. it was woeful.
