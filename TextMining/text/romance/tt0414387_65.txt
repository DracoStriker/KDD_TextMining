First off, let me say that I hardly ever cry. Even when watchingtouching films such as "The English Patient" or "Million Dollar Baby",the most I've gone was a burning sensation in my throat.I'd previously watched the BBC Miniseries of "Pride and Prejudice" andthought that it was pretty good. My friend recommended this one to meages ago but I never got around to watching it until last night. And Iloved it! I loved the costumes and the settings (especially the rainyscene where Elizabeth and Darcy have a little spat), and the wittydialog. The last couple of scenes in the movie (ie. when Bingleyproposes to Jane, when Elizabeth and Darcy both couldn't sleep and meteach other in the fields, when Elizabeth was explaining to her fatherhow much she loved Darcy etc) were so touching that I started to cry.The actors and actresses were wonderful. I especially loved Mr Bingley,Georgiana and Mr Darcy. No matter how small a role they played, theymanaged to bring out the essence of the character.One small note of discontent (is that possible???) is how some of thepersonal scenes towards the end between Elizabeth and Dary were leftout from the movie. I would have liked to see them share a little kiss,just like at the end of the 1995 BBC version. *Sigh*
