I went to see this with with a degree of scepticism, and very fondmemories of the TV series and Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. No need toworry, I do believe they met the challenge of every English female tohave watched the TV series with "that" scene in it and maybe evensurpassed it... it took my breath away.This version has been filmed with sensitivity and emotional insight,telling more with a glance here and a look there than a thousand wordscan say. Having said that the vocal "sparring" between Lizzie and MrDarcy is both intelligent and witty. The whole picture house joined inwith the journey, sighing, laughing and gasping in all the same places.I felt completely at home with all the characters, Keira is wonderfulas Elizabeth, Mathew Macfadyen, tremendous as Darcy, Brenda Blethynoutstanding as Mrs Bennet, Donald Sutherland a joy to watch as always.Nobody disappoints in this ensemble and I spent the most uplifting 2hours of my time for a very long while, and left feeling happy andcontent, with a tear in my eye and a spring in my step.
