I had heard the controversy about the non-canonical ending, so I wentin fully prepared to hate this version.It's wonderful. It's note-perfect throughout. It's hard to see how the casting could beimproved: Jane and Mrs Bennett were perfect; Knightley was surprisinglygood (who suspected that she could pull off the role of ElizabethBennett?); and Sutherland was born to play Mr. Bennett. The interiors,set decoration, and costumes looked perfect; the dances wereastonishing - and the outdoor scenes were everything they should be.(There's a credit for "digital effects" - I presume that was whathelped the landscapes look so good.) Poor Mr.Darcy has an impossiblejob following Firth's definitive performance, but he succeeds inbringing a very credible interpretation to the role.All in all, I found this to be a MUCH better version than the reviewswould suggest. A pleasant surprise.
