I am so sorry that I missed this at the theater. This is a very movingand wonderfully emotional love story. The actors fit beautifully withintheir characters, and it is hard to imagine them as any other person. Ihave loved watching Donald Sutherland my whole life, and he continuesto surprise me with his incredible skills of interpreting a characterand making me believe he is actually that person. Matthew Macfadyen isalso wonderful as Mr. Darcy...just wonderful. Keira Knightly andRosamund Pike were such believable sisters and were superb. As Iwatched the movie I was wishing I could be in the Bennett family withthem all. Though I love seeing movies, rarely does a film pull me intoit the way this one does.I have had one favorite movie for most of my life (Gone with the Wind).This "favorite" was cracked just a tinge by the Lord of the Ringstrilogy, though it was a different genre. Pride & Prejudice has takenover. I rented it two weeks ago and can't stop watching it. I loveeverything about it and will have to actually buy it to add to my smallcollection. It's a wonderful escape with a truly "wish I were her"ending. It varies slightly from the book but does so without removingthe main scenes and dialog, and it pulls all pieces together withoutleaving ends hanging.Thank you all for bringing such a wonderful escape to my life!
