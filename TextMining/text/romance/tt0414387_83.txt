I admit to a slight bias, having watched the 1995 version and lovingit. But then, I've watched several versions of the same movie before,i.e. Emma, and Jane Eyre, and liked them all. My main concern with thismovie was the length. How would the makers be true to the book, andstill fit it into a shorter feature? I wanted to watch it, if for noother reason than to find out.I think the only redeeming quality that I found in the entire movie wasthat the actors were about the same ages as the characters that theyportrayed, unlike the 1995 version.I didn't care for Matthew McFayden's Mr. Darcy. I thought he spoke toofast and was unconvincing. While I am sure he's a wonderful actor, Idon't think this was a good part for him. Kiera Knightly didn't sparkas Lizzie, her portrayal was a bit lifeless. I didn't even want them toget together in the end.The makers glossed over so many parts, probably to fit it into theshorter time frame, that I really felt shortchanged by this particularversion. Even Judi Dench, and Donald Sutherland (both actors that Ilove to watch) couldn't hold this movie up, since they're parts weretoo small to make an impact.I would, however, recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't read thebook. But for anyone who has read the book, I recommend the 1995BBC/A&E miniseries.
