Between Deborah Moggach's god-awful screenplay and director JoeWright's dismal vision of a filthy, graceless English upper class, thisis the most dismal of the many film versions of Jane Austen's classicsince the laughably bad 1940 movie. The Elizabeth Bennett of this movie is a slovenly, thick-headed countrybumpkin who eats like a slob, plays the pianoforte like a ham-fisted5-year-old and has the conversational skills of an autistic teenageboy. She lives in a grubby, falling down hovel surrounded by untendedfields, dusty drives and muddy yards filled with free-roaminglivestock. Compared to this version of poor Elizabeth, Tess of theDurbervilles was like Marie Antoinette. Elizabeth is not alone in thiscoarseness, however; director Wright gives us an entire class of peoplewho look more like ragtag medieval peasants than 19th centuryaristocrats.Do yourself a favor and ignore this travesty. The marvelous 1995mini-series starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is vastly better inevery way, especially its choice of sticking faithfully to JaneAusten's dialogue and plot line, instead of debasing them with a cheesyHollywood attempt at embellishment.
