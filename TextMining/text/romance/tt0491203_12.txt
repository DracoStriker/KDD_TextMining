It could have been really good movie, if it was not that absurd. Wasn'tsure if I was supposed to watch a drama or a comedy. Almost until theend I felt certain there will be a plot twist and it will turn out thatMr. Waltz planned his wife's affair with the painter in order toincrease his chances to have a heir, even if he won't be the father. Imean, he obviously paid attention to details. Why otherwise they wouldshow him finding the trade deceit in the beginning, as well as he saidsomething about eating fish too often and said something like: "Are youin love with the fishguy?" I thought he was quite observant and wasactually pulling the triggers for both lovers in hope of giving hiswife some happiness and himself a heir. Was sure he knew about who waspregnant, as well. Was really disappointed to find out that hedidn't...but the end was totally absurd. I mean between the 2 lovers,who actually lacked any chemistry and the male cast was a TERRIBLEchoice. Weak and forgettable actor. Anyway, I really enjoyed watchingsome of the actors, but that was all about it. The script and dialoguewere very weak and they really couldn't settle on a genre for thismovie...
