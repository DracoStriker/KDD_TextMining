Several reasons may tempt you to watch Tulip Fever. In my case thosewere the historical background (Amsterdam, 17th century) and theactors. Indeed both factors are worth noting. Based on trailers onecould easily mix up characters of the movie with the figures fromRembrandt paintings. It seemed that production design was done at itsbest so that the viewer is dipped into the epoch. Plus, characters areplayed by famous actors, Christoph Waltz, Alicia Vikander and DaneDeHaan. Interestingly, Clara Delevingne is also there, as if we see aprequel of Besson's Valerian.Despite the mentioned ingredients, which if used properly could be agood recipe for the Oscar contender, the movie is a disappointment. Thebiggest problem is probably the script. Dialogues and actions do notconvince at all. The historical tulip fever in the movie is notimpressive at all. The romantic line is shown very superficially. It isreally difficult to believe that what you see on screen could actuallyhappen in reality. There is an obvious lack in the development ofcharacters. Due to this they may surprise you a lot during the film.Some story moves are completely unexpected. The director's work alsoraises questions. The authors of the movie have not decided forthemselves how serious their movie has to be: whether it should be adrama, a comedy, or rather a TV show. It seems that the movie starts inone genre and ends in another. Of course, some movies are difficult tobe attributed to a specific genre, for instance, some pure art-housejoints. However, in this case this is not art-house at all, and jumpingbetween different ways of storytelling is not a good idea.So, the only reason to watch this movie is to convince yourself thatgood actors play sometimes in bad movies.
