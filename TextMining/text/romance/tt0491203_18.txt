Well written, perfect casting and supporting actors allow Vikander toshowcase her amazingly compelling stage presence. Cinematography wasalso superlative, taking us back to 17th century Amsterdam so we couldobserve feel and do everything but touch these very real people.Special applause goes to the sex scenes and nudity which allow me/us tosee vikander making love in a very lurid and revealing nude scene. Thecamera and the lovers positioning hide those private parts, but we seemore than enough to be aroused by their arousal. Something about AliciaVikander that allows her persona and facial expressions to transformher attractive features into a somewhat mesmerizing-have to see more,can't take my eyes off you- attraction. Thank God-and her agents andherself for getting a hold of this script and taking part in a veryfirst-rate, rare-WELL DONE movie.
