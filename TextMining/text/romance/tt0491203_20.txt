If it was one. The movie was fun and entertaining and a joy to watch.It feels like a comedy, despite its dark drama tone, or rather style.It made me fell like I should not laugh, so I didn't, which was hardnot to do. A great tale taking place during an era in history when everyone wasgoing wild over what was a new and rare flower. Didn't fully understandor grasp the entire Tulip Fever joust but luckily that was more of asub plot despite the title. The movie is a strange Shakespeare-likelove affair between a painter and a woman who was practically sold to awell meaning man to be his wife. How perfect was it that Christoph Waltz plays this well meaning man.It's one of his best attributes, playing a bad guy that you can't helpto like. Though not as evil as his charter in Tim Burton's Big Eyes ( Imention this movie because they are closer in comparison), he just actsas the antagonist in the plot that centers around two people who shouldnot and cannot be together in a somewhat Romeo and Juliet style offate. Also give a shout out to Zach Galifianakis. There were somepretty big names in this film (As far as acting. I mean with threeOscar winners in it), and Zachary had to stomp it with the big dogs.Though his role was very small, it was important as it really pointsout that this is a dark comedy.It reads like a sex romp comedy too cultured and sophisticated for mytaste (Prefer other Galifianakis works like The Hangover ), but it'sdone well, so I really enjoy it.http://cinemagardens.com/
