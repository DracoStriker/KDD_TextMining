This is one of the most visually beautiful films I have seen in a longtime. Settings and costumes are exquisite! The story line is true tothe period, with a number of twists and turns. Acting is excellent.There was never a dull moment for me. It might help if the viewer issomewhat aware of the former trade in tulips in The Netherlands.
