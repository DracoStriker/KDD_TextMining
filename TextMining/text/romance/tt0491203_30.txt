I have put a lot of store in Metacritic ratings, but found their ratingon this surprisingly far from mine own impression (them 37 me 71). Thisis rare, but then again I rarely go see movies if they rate it below70. Stoppard is a genius, and as a production designer I can't pass upa film whose trailers show decent period design, so i had to go see iton the big screen.The design here was indeed pretty good, a little stagy on the interiorsand a bit too obvious CGI, but worth the price of admission on its ownnone the less. The acting is actually very good, and the script hassome nice subtleties, with a clever, satisfying and unusually nuancedresolution. Perhaps part of what turned the critics were the expectations. Thebudget was high, the cast renowned and everyone agrees that Stoppard isa genius, leading to some let down for what might have been. But youneed to meet a piece of art where it stands and not where you hoped itmight be, and this is a much better film that its reviews suggest.
