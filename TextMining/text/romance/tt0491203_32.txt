I went to see it despite all the negative publicity and thoroughlyenjoyed it. Especially when you consider all the carp out there. It's asmart screenplay, well acted and we'll cast. And you get to watchVikander for two hours! Honest, it's pretty good,and entertaining.Anice respite from the usual summer junk. I loved it.
