Something about Dane Dehaan creeps me out and every film I have seenwith him in it I find I am distracted. It's like he is a 50 year oldportraying a 20 year old. I know this doesn't seem fair, but I justcan't wrap my head around his recent rise in Hollywood and all of theseparts that he doesn't seem to fit? Am I missing something? The actressin this was wonderful and I liked her in Ex Machina as well. This is avery dark intense film, beautifully shot, but leaves a strange aftertaste.
