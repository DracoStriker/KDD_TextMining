In watching movies I have a couple of basic rules. The one rule in thatlist that pertains to this movie is: "The actions and decisions of saneor flawed characters in a movie must make some sense in a real way". Inthis movie they do not.Here are two questions that I'll ask and you tell me the honest answer.Question 1: Would you keep a secret hidden that although embarrassingwould make the difference between a 4 year prison term and possiblelife in prison? Question 2: If you were studying law and hadinformation that could radically change the outcome of a trial wouldyou withhold it?My guess is that 99.9% of people would say no to both questions. Inthis movie, the other choice was made for both.This alone destroys the credibility of the film's premise, but there ismuch more. Here's another question: If you had a love affair with amuch older women while you were 16, would you eventually take yourdaughter to her grave site and recite every gory detail, promising hera "big surprise" before doing so?I could go on but you get the point. The basic premise of the movieIMHO is brilliant, that is, "how could so many people do such inhumanethings to other human beings while thousands of others knew but didnothing". The gigantic problem with the movie is the question waspondered while multiple characters in the movie did implausible things.This movie could have been brilliant; sadly it is anything but.
