Very well acted and presented and a faithful representation of the mainpoints of the novel on which it is based. This film encourages us tolook closely at very difficult issues surrounding the atrocities ofWorld War II. I am at a loss to understand why so many critics havebeen so damning of it. Perhaps it is too subtle for them to understand.It seeks to outlaw the false and intellectually lazy theory to explainthe holocaust, namely that the horrors were committed by monsters. Inits place we are offered contextualization, not as excuse but asexplanation of how quite ordinary people were able to doextraordinarily dreadful things. We avoid these uncomfortable facts atour peril.
