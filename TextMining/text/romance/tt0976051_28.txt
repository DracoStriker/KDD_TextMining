I read Bernhard Schlink's book in two sittings. It was an engrossingread. One could imagine what a stunning film it would make. However, Ihave to agree with some of the other writers in this post that StephenDaldry failed to create an engaging movie considering all the materialhe had at his disposal. Every director and screenwriter given the taskof adapting a book selects a number a scenes from the book. Rarely dothey have the luxury of following the book by rote. But Daldry/Harechose to illuminate areas of the book which should have been left tothe book. The power of Schlinks's book is it's love story. MichaelBerg's discovery that the love of his life was once a monster. Histormented imagination over the years, and Hanna's involvement in thecrime. History and German guilt are interesting subjects in books, butthey don't often materialize into passionate themes on film. We want tobe shown the passion and the crime, not lectured to.
