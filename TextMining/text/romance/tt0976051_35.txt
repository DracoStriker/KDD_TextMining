"The Reader" is about illiteracy and its impact. Hopefully it leads viewers to a comprehension of the effect thisAchilles' heel has on people who are otherwise perfectly normal and theisolation it propagates. The reason Hanna Smitz turned down promotion, firstly as a productionworker at Siemens and then as a Clippie was, she couldn't move upbecause people would find out that she couldn't read or write. The reason this woman became a concentration camp guard was reading andwriting weren't necessary. The reason she got 20 years instead of 4 was she still didn't wantanyone to know. Admitting this failing was more complicates for herthan admitting her role in the Holocaust.
