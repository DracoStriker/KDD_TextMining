This movie was faultless for the first two thirds. It lost its focus atthe end and it felt like the opportunity to finish as a masterpiece waslost.Because of this, the most important message in the story seems to havepassed most viewers by. It was being played out in the court sceneswhen we learn that (perhaps due to ignorance or lack of education) theprison guard was unable to recognize that it was more important to savelives instead of performing her job. Of course, this was not some sortof excuse being offered ... but what was unfolding before our eyes wasthat the (highly educated law student) kid was in that courtroomperforming effectively the same crime.By not speaking up when he should have, Michael Berg misjudged how toact as a human. His actions not just improperly sentenced HannaSchmitz, but allowed some real criminals to go free. The irony in thissituation was pure genius. Of course, the genius was in the book - themovie did a good job of bringing it to the non-readers.We get to learn that the author of the original book believed theHolocaust was not just the fault of the Nazis .. rather the whole ofthe German people were to blame, perhaps a societal structure with aninherent inability to be moral or to assume responsibility for theiractions. We see Hanna as a metaphor for the old Germany and Michaelthat of the new.It was a real pity the movie floundered around in the last third or so,and diluted this, and other, powerful messages. Nonetheless, it isstill a movie you must watch. What a shame it didn't quite hit the homerun that it deserved.
