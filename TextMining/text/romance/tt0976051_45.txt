The Reader is an interesting non-formulaic story, with a complexcharacter (Hanna Schmitz) played by Kate Winslet. Though, as somecharacters mention in the movie, it seems there's not much to learnfrom the experience of watching it.Consider the protagonist: admitting illiteracy is more shameful thanadmitting participating in mass murder? And why didn't Hanna learn toread on her own after she met Michael, or before that anyway? Anothernote: Hanna's justification of why she let the 300 prisoners die in achurch that caught on fire is not that she was told to (which would beexplainable by Philip Zimbardo's experiments on abuse of power underduress from authority figures), or that she'd be prosecuted herself,but that... there would have been chaos if she let the prisoners free.Good role model for schizophrenia perhaps.What might be learned from this movie is summarized in this quote bythe old law professor:...Societies think they operate by something called morality, but theydon't. They operate by something called law....8000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted,and only 6 of murder....The question is never "Was it wrong", but "Was it legal". And not byour laws, no. By the laws at the time.
