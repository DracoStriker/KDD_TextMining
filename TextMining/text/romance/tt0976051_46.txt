I was deeply touched by the film's primary message, that, althoughthere were countless evil leaders within the Nazi regime, there werealso those misfortunates, like this illiterate woman, who were victims,certainly by their own choice, but more for reasons that point to theirown survival.Having no education, however, does not make one unable to feel, aswitnessed by this woman's love for literature and for a 16 year oldboy, no matter what some might think about her contributing to thedelinquency of a minor. After all, how many of us today got our startwillingly in our teens? Being illiterate can, and in this case, did,create for Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) limited options for employment.And so she went for whatever door opened to her, not knowing where itwould lead.I keep asking myself why Hanna didn't admit to her illiteracy whenprompted to show a sample of her handwriting by her prosecutors? Was itembarrassment, or was she willing to be a scapegoat in order to keepthe other women guards from a possible death sentence? Was illiteracy,in that day, on the same scale as an unpardonable sin? I saw in "TheReader" that one can love another as God loves us, without reservation,no matter our iniquities. Love forgives, and covers a multitude ofsins.In this film, however, only the very select reaped what she'd sown.
