Ourstory begins in 1995 as our hero, Ralph Fiennes comments about hisdaughter's impending visit. We are soon transported back to 1958 as ourcharacter is seen as a young teenager getting violently ill in therain. He is assisted by a woman who takes him to her apartment andbefore a whole lot has transpired they have begun a sexual affair, anaffair that both parties keep secret. We move forward eight years hencewhen our hero is a young law student witnessing the war crimes trial ofseveral minor SS guards. The woman that taught him about sexual love isone of the women in the dock.As difficult as it is to sum up in under 100 words what this film isabout, it is just as rewarding to the patient viewer. It covers a widerange of issues and has something important to say about a wide rangeof subjects, from The Holocaust to adult literacy. From lustful sex torepressed memories. Kate Winslet is absolutely stunning as a woman whoages forty years before our eyes. Every performance rings true to someextent and that is no easy task given the depth of the lead. "TheReader" is a film that will reward the patient viewer with one of thebest paced and developed stories of the year.
