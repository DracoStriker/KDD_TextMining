I watched this riveting movie without prior knowledge of the book whichit is sourced from by Bernard Schlink. Some reviewers had implied thatit is hard to follow given a complex flashbacks plotting device butneither I nor Jeana had any difficulty in keeping up.It's very good. Kate Winslet's performance is, in my view, a careerhigh and the young Michael Berg, played by David Kross, puts in anoutstanding turn as Winslet's young (underage) lover, before the partis taken over beautifully by Ralph Feinnes. Lena Olin has only a verysmall part at the end of the movie, playing the daughter of a Holocaustsurvivor but her role is fundamental to the film's denouement and shecarries it off stunningly.I'd rather not spoil the plot by revealing the key central twist whichyou can see coming, but it is very effective and takes the third act ofthe movie into a new, and unexpected dimension. The first act isessentially a seduction and the second, a courtroom drama. All threeare paced slowly but carefully. In lesser hands this film could havegone so wrong in so many ways but the acting is supplemented by greatwriting (David Hare - well, what do you expect) direction (StevenDaldry) and Cinematography (Roger Deakins whose last brilliant moviewas No Country For Old Men). Indeed the movie is nominated for bestfilm, writing directing and supporting actress at the Golden Globes.Quite rightly in my opinion.It's very moving and given the nature of Winslet's role it's a tributeto her and the production team that you sympathise with her throughout,even though she clearly would not find universal favour.7.5 out of 10.
