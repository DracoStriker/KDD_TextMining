I will start by saying I have never seen a movie which made me feel theway The Reader does. It captures every emotion that can be experienced.I was in tears at one moment, and in a blank stare at another moment.Kate Winslet was incredible playing Hanna Shmitz. Her raw attitude andpersonality creates a clear visual of her character. David Kross showshis true potential playing Michael Berg - I see a prominent future inhis acting career. It is very rare when a movie can move you in such away as The Reader does. You get lost in the story and the characters.There is not one thing that I would want to change about this film. Ihave never had such a strong reaction to a movie. This movie shows thesignificance one person can have on another - even if it is only for abrief period of time. The affects an individual can make on another canbe tremendous, and tragic. The love, the pain, and the heartache areall expressed with extreme care in this film. Stephen Daldry should notgo without applause, as well as all the actors. This is a movie thatwill stand the test of time, and teach us of true human individuality,morals, and nature. A re-occurring thought was in my head throughoutthe film, "Someone had this story in their head, in their mind -Somehow, someone created this beautiful story - Where do people come upwith this?" You should not miss this, it's a true gift to cinema.
