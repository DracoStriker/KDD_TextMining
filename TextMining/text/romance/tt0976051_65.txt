If Kate Winslet, who won a Golden Globe for this performance, does notwin the Oscar for the same role, then there is no justice in the world.She was absolutely incredible in a role that had her go from predator,to victim; from seemingly oblivious to the magnitude of what she did,to someone willing to take blame that wasn't hers to avoidembarrassment.It is extremely hard to critique this film without giving away themagnificent plot, so I will try my best to avoid anything that would dothat.Bruno Ganz played a law professor that was critical to enjoying thismovie because he made us think about the role of the individual, of thecollective, of society, of everyone in the horrible massacre that wasthe Holocaust, and also makes us think of our role in the massacresthat are going on around the world in Darfur and Iraq. Are weresponsible by doing nothing? Can we really say we do not know what isgoing on? It was pointed out that there were 1000 concentration camps.Every German knew. What was their responsibility? What of theresponsibility of the 52 million Americans who voted for Bush in 2004knowing what was happening in Iraq and Guantanamo? One cannot avoid thecomparisons, although the Jews had it far worse.Ralph Fiennes put in an incredibly good performance, but nothingcompared to Winslet. She solidified her acting credentials in thisamazing film.
