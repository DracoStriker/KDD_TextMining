This film is such a masterpiece of Integration vs. black and whiteSplitting of more or less subtle categorizations by a culture withvillains vs. heroes that any attempt to explain or describe the magicof Reality as it is presented in it would be equal to trying to explainthe meaning of a poem without reading it. So, go see it. My accoladehere is not going to be a spoiler. You can't have too highexpectations. If you allow yourself to embrace the material, you'll befine. The book was written by a German of the generation of sons andgrandsons of those who actually lived in the country which was rippedapart and humiliated after the defeat in WW I. (The War that wascheered and welcomed by many prominent German intellectuals of thetime, including S.Freud and T.Mann). The country, which in the 1930swas "raised from its knees" (expression coined by V.Putin pertaining tocontemporary Russia). This euphoria of newly acquired power and toxicdemagoguery of a bunch of psychopaths, which was eagerly soaked by apopulation hungry for self-respect and "stability" (another of Putin'spropaganda terms) twisted the usual (tenuous as it is) moral fabric ofthe society and desensitized the whole country. How the characters acted appears to be natural - albeit not approvableby hindsight and conventional morality. Everyone is guilty and everyoneis a victim of seemingly inevitable circumstances. Some redeemedthemselves in a 'third meaning' way. Watching this film I felt such acathartic sadness.... You ought to allow yourself to be open to thisprofound presentation of our so called 'human nature' and be preparedto take it in and let it make your tears flow. Cry your eyes out myfellow humans...
