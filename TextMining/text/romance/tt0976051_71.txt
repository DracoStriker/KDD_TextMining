Without the masterful acting by Kate Winslet, The Reader would havebeen a mediocre film overall.It is a touching story of a woman trying to hide from her past, only torealize that death is the only way to atone for the cruelty she hascommitted as a former Nazi prisoner guard.The storyline is simple and to be honest, I don't think the nude scenesare even necessary at all. The bond between the older woman and anunder-aged (Michael confessed of being 15 year-old later in the film)can be expressed aptly without having to be explicitly andsubstantially depicted in the many sexual encounters. I think thescript can be improved and trigger more empathy in the audience if thekindness nature of Hannah can be described more vividly. The scriptprefers to show the more sensual, sexual and yet inquisitive nature ofthe central character. Then again, all these can be made more balanced,with a little touch of adjustment to the overall emotional repertoireof the character.This film is lucky to be supported by the many good acting throughoutthe film, including that from minor roles such as that of the Americangirl/woman who survived the fire and Holocast.I find it difficult to grade this film. For Winslet's acting, 10/10. Nodoubt about it. I find her acting is much stronger than AngelinaJolie's acting in Changeling, which is somehow wooden. Jolie certainlydoes not have the range of emotional acting ability as Charlize Theron,Kate Winslet and Meryl Streep. For the script, I would give it a 3/10.
