I found this movie utterly compelling. We stumbled across it whenchannel flicking and were immediately hooked.At the heart of the movie is a moral dilemma faced by a law student, animpossible choice over a small intervention that could have majorconsequences on the life of the woman he loves. It's rather contrived,but the superb performances of Kate Winslet and Bruno Ganz make itcompletely believable. Ralph Fiennes is OK as the older Michael butthis is Ganz and Winslet's movie really.Even as the denouement approaches, the plot rightly allows no room foreasy resolution or absolution of the moral issues. It's heart- rendingviewing but excellent.
