This is a work with the history, life and death, a very heavy theme. Ithink about how I compensate for the mistake that has been repeated inthe history. German Nazis party is the keyword of this.It is an elaborated story that this movie is splendid. It is therelationship of a man and a woman ?their name is Michael and Hannah? ifI say in detail. They surely love, but always pass each other; and arenot equal relations. If their relationship included the top and abottom, two people met you; Hannah is the top at first. Michael is astudent learning a law, and Hannah is an older woman working by rail ofthe cities. But, in fact, Hannah does not understand a letter, and theposition relations with him who learns both the Greek and the Latinreverse. They meet again in a court. She is the person is judged. He isa person judging.The Nazis party killed many people. However, even so, it is difficultfor all people concerned with the Nazis party to execute it. She is nottotally without a crime, but she may say one people of the victim ifshe changes a viewpoint.
