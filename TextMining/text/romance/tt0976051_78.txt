I rarely had the opportunity to watch such an intense film. The storybegins in a strange, rather uncomfortable manner. It takes a while forthe watcher to understand the message beneath. So much emotion...! Iloved it!The actor's performance is exquisite. Kate Winslet is a great performerand her fans will not be disappointed with this role. It's a hauntingand heart-breaking. Their performances are jaw-droppingly brilliant. When "The Reader's" credits rolled, I sat quietly shaken by what I hadwitnessed. It's a film that is impossible to forget. When a grownMichael asks Hanna, "Have you spent much time thinking about the past?"Heartbroken, she replies, "It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn'tmatter what I feel. The dead are still dead." She's right.
