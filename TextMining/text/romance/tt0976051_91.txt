I'm not a fan of holocaust films and I suspected this was one. But infact this is more en exploration of the reality of having to make yourway through a war. And though the young male lead (David Kross)isespecially flawless, Kate Winslet is even more luminous andunforgettable. For me, Ms. Winslet epitomizes what an actress should befar more boldly than, say, Meryl Streep. She seems to crave exploringother persona to the point she can authentically speak for them. What'smore, there's something oddly disarming about the way she so easilygoes nude in many of her movies. She might as well be chiding the restof us for our utter lack of courage.I would fault this film with being a little long on its intimate scenesfor my taste though I'm not sure it would work otherwise. But this filmfor me is head and shoulders above others I've seen covering the samesubject matter. It makes you think more clearly about what it must havemeant to be a Nazi, working for the camps, and though I can imaginethere will be people who think this is some kind of apologia for thosewho worked in the death camps, I would argue this merely highlightstheir own lack of compassion.Ralph Fiennes role is a difficult one and I'm not sure he fullyconquers it, but he certainly isn't very far from making it real. Tryto imagine what could have been done to make his performance better. Ican't think of a single thing.
