This is an amazingly believable film. The types of dilemmas faced bythe characters are the kinds of things that easily could have happened.There's pride and anger and self doubt. This is really a story about aman who has been shaken loose from innocence, who must face the factthat someone he loved or thought he loved could have been a monster.Still, even if she was a monster, we cannot totally condemn her. KateWinslet is incredible from the sexually driven streetcar conductor tothe perpetrator of an event that killed hundreds of Jews. The amazingthing is that she can't get her mind around what she has done. She sawit as a way to find work since everyone was at war and she needed theemployment. She is painfully honest which is hard to fathom for thecourts. Roy Fiennes has a connection to her because of their affair,but he is still repulsed by the events. Because of his basic humankindness he continues to read to her as he did by recording books onaudio tapes (he comes to realize that she can't read or write). Thereare not simple answers and no last minute discovery; it's about peopletrying to connect. This is a fine film.
