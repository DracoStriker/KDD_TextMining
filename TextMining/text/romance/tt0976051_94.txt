The Reader is a decent drama with good performances especially fromKate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and newcomer David Kross. Director StephenDaldry is admirable in making this movie about a brief affair betweenan older woman and a much younger man who years later now a law studentre-encounters his former love as she defends herself in a war-crimetrial. Kate Winslet turns in a great performance as Hannah and she morethan deserved the Oscar she received for this one. Winslet continues toshow audiences why she's one of Hollywoods most talented and bravestactresses today especially in the films steamy sex scenes. RalphFieness is equally impressive as the older Michael now a law studentwho still has feelings for his first love Hannah. Fiennes proves to beeffective in the role as he does with most of the characters he'splayed in other films. Newcomer David Kross turns in a good performanceas well. He shows some real talent and bravery especially in thenudity/love scenes his character has with Winslet. The rest of the castare also solid in their limited screen time. The pacing of the moviewas a little slow at times and some actors (like Winslet and Fiennes)weren't in it as much as I thought they would be but all of them aregreat in it none the less. Overall The Reader is a decent drama aboutlove, consequences, secrets, and revelations with powerful performancesby the cast (especially Winslet and Fiennes) who make it worthwatching.
