Don't spend your time comparing it to the book. If you just sit therecomparing the book and the movie, you'll take the fun out of the movieitself. If you are a book reader, reading Midnight Sun really helpsunderstand Edward's reactions and such. This is the best movie I'veseen that has stayed the closest to the book as much as it could. I dounderstand why they made a few changes to please some of the moviegoerswho haven't read the book. It ties things in a different but acceptableway. I loved how they interpreted the book. I understand that it was ateen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times. Buthey, the book is geared towards a teen audiences regardless of the wideage range that actually reads it. I think Summit did a good job andshould make New Moon.
