I've never wanted to walk out of a movie so badly. I think you shouldgive the film a chance to develop fully before forming an opinion. Thiswas certainly not a "film" with any substance. The acting was horrible,the script was horrible, the whole thing was rushed and insubstantial.For being such a predicted box office hit, given the already large fanbase, the budget must have been dismal. I think you would need to be noolder than 10 to enjoy this film, but the kissing scene in Bella'sbedroom was too passionate for a kid's movie (Bella's in herpanties!?). In the books it takes them a long time to move forward withtheir physical relationship. The story was clearly written with teensin mind but still enjoyable for adults. The movie was a cringer.
