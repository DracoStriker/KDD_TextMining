** SPOILER ** This is just about the worst movie I have ever seen. Ifthere was not so much hype about the book this movie would have wentstraight to DVD or the garbage. This is nothing like the book. It wasalmost like the screenwriter had to change absolutely everything nomatter how insignificant the detail. Don't even rent this. I am so sadI just love these books. I am reading through them for the third time.Bella acting was horrible. She seemed to hate Edward more thananything. She had no emotions. Most scenes felt very awkward. Edwardwas not pale. Edward had no dark circles under his eyes. Edward in thesunlight AWFUL AWFUL. I can only hope they remake this. The book wasway too good for this. It is just sad.
