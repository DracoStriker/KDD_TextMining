this movie is nothing compared to the book. i have just seen thepremiere and i regret waiting in line for the 8 hours that i was there.the movie does not follow the plot line at all mixing, editing andadding many things which make it loose its charm. the actors arehorrible. Kristen Stewards acting was HORRIBLE, and also most notablyjasper who seemed to be constantly constipated. there were only acouple of good scenes which survived the horrible mash up that thismovie basically is, and many scenes which were supposed to have beenromantic but instead took a turn for the worse. all i can say is thatthis movie seems like another Epic Movie only this time parodyingTwilight. This movie was made in bad taste, with bad actors, and didnot stay true to the book for the most part. I do not recommend it toanyone who is a fan of the book, because it will ruin your view of it.
