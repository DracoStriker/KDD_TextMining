OK, so I read the 4 books in 5 days while my husband was out of town.They are certainly not going to be classics, but I will admit that I(mostly) enjoyed them.I dragged the hubby to see the movie tonight, and let's just say it waspayback for the time he made me see Silent HillFirst off it was totally miscast. Bella could not complete a sentenceto save her life, and was absolutely unappealing. Edward was supposedto be the most beautiful and charming man on earth, instead he was aclumsy and bizarro stalker There was zero chemistry between them...andtheir chemistry is kind of the basis of the book. Jasper looked andacted like a constipated Edward Scissorhands. Esme was sweet and atleast looked about like I would have expected. The other Cullens werenot in the movie enough to decide if I liked them or not.The special effects and makeup were just weird! The flying, jumping,climbing, & running stuff I swear they just looked to be dangling fromcords. The big ballet studio fight was passable...only the bad guyJames was just not that bad...and the end where Edward sucks the venomout??? Good Lord it was bad.If I were Catherine Hardwicke I would be very very ashamed. Thescreenplay must have been God awful...In short, I alternated between embarrassed for everyone involved,verging on hysterical laughter from beginning to end, and thinking thatI should have just gotten my $10 worth and hopped into the next theaterwhere Changeling was playing.If you liked the book stay far far away from this movie
