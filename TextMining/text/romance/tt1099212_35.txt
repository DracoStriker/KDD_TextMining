Although the marketing blitz and the huge crowds of screaming teenagegirls would suggest something of a cultural phenomenon, the movie justfell flat on it's face in spite of the hype. This story could have beentold in a 20 minute short, and could have been just as effective.The washed out colors to add "dreariness" (I'm assuming) gave me a bitof a headache. Miss Stewart - however cute she may be - seemed to beonly given one direction, and that was to "stare longingly into hisface with your lips slightly open". The softball game was ridiculous.The "300" style of editing infuriates me to no end, and it's been WAYoverdone lately. Plus, the "Ozzie and Harriet with fangs" family scenewas painfully stupid. I really don't know what the attraction of thisstoryline is, but apparently all you need is 2 good looking actors,some sexual tension, and an edgy soundtrack and it's all gravy. Thiswas one of the most shallow movies I've seen in years. Save your money.
