So, so very bad. Robert Pattinson, the male lead, is made-up like theAvon Lady. Nikki Reed looks like one of the black guys in White Chicksand Kristen Stewart was as wooden and flat as a living human being canpossibly be. The special effects are not equal to 50's TV and thescript was painful to hear. Perhaps that is why the actors performed onsomething equal to middle-school level.The sooner this tasteless little flick fades away, the better.I assume Summit is rushing to complete the rest of the movies beforethe fan base grows up and develops some sense of taste.Oh well, you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear.
