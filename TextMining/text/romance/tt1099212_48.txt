First of all i just want to say that i have read the book about a fewdays before watching the movie. The book is amazing and recommend it toanyone out there. Now thats been said, in my opinion the movie isabsolutely horrible.I didn't see the movie in theaters, and i'm so glad i didn't. There isno clear storyline whatsoever. After watching the first 25 minutes, ifelt as if someone had cut the scenes before they had ended. In fact ihad asked my friend if this version was in somehow edited by a teenageboy. The movie is so awkward i just felt like laughing. Where Bellasees the police car she says 'what is going on' as if she is readingfrom the script. I felt like i was watching some depressing parody ofthe movie instead. Kristen looked depressed in this whole movie, nofacial expressions whatsoever! I think she might have smiled oncethroughout this whole movie. When she goes to his parents house, heracting is even more unbearable. The cast of Edward's family is verywell done, and at least they know how to act. Rob was good, except icould do without the pasty make-up job.WATCH THIS MOVIE. You will laugh. Its just so funny. I can't wait untilanother sort of 'scary movie' comes out and they take their time todisregard all the other movies this year and do twilight. Hahaha Choppyscenes, horrible acting, and the graphics? WHATS UP WITH THAT? Takethat Catherine Hardwicke! REMAKE PLEASE?
