Thankfully I didn't bring my husband with me when I saw this movie. Iwent by myself and I was STILL embarrassed by its sappy/corny screenwriting. The movie doesn't catch the essence of the books at all. Theeffects were horrible. The "blurs" when the vampires were movinguber-fast looked like a sad mistake from a bad 1970s film, and thewire-work when Edward and Bella are leaping from Edward's room to atree looks like NOTHING like a leap; they clumsily swing back andforth. yuck. Rob's American accent is generally prettyunbelievable--unless Edward is supposed to have a speech impediment.Some of the acting in the movie was pretty good--Charlie, Rosalie, anda few others, for instance. Most of the acting was Horrible--and hereI'm mainly talking about the two MAIN characters. Not believable atALL. Kristen Stewart is WAY too serious, and she doesn't let you intoher head at all----which is a huge part of the books, I might add. It'slike she's just looking for good camera angles the whole movie through.Rob Pattinson makes vampirism seem really boring. He doesn't do wellplaying a perfect character. In interviews he even says that KristenStewart is intimidating in real life and probably looks like the realvampire in the movie, because she made him nervous and clumsy....THAT'svampire-like! Bad directing. Does Catherine Hardwicke hate the lightside of human nature, or what? It seems like most of the actors in allthe movies she's ever directed hardly smile at all. nice going. i won'tbe seeing this movie again. Let's just hope I can get this out of myhead by the time I read the series over again. Don't waste your time.
