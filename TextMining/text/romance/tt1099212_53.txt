All right, so I have read all the books, and i LOVE them. I love EdwardCullen and everything, okay? I just thought the movie was HORRIBLE. Imay have compared the movie to the book, but even as a movie, I did notlike it. Robert Pattinson is not an Edward. I'm sorry, but he is not:well in my eyes he isn't, so no flaming. There were many crucial scenesthat should have been in there like the blood-typing and the meadowwhich were replaced by other not as important ones. I also think thatthe sparkle effect was not very good at all; I mean, seriously, a twoyear old could do that. The dialogue was also delivered all wrong, anda romance was turned into a complete comedy. Like my friends and I wereliterally cracking up the whole time. I'm not saying that Summit is abad company, or that Catherine Hardwicke is a bad director, or theactors are bad, but this movie SUCKED.Don't get me wrong; loved the books(well, except for Breaking Dawn),hate the movie.
