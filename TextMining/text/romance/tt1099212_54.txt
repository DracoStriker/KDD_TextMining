I could tell from the trailer this movie was trash, but out ofcuriosity and boredom/insomnia i gave it a download (would never pay apenny to watch this). I couldn't even make it halfway through withoutturning it off. The storytelling was like reading a children's book:everything told in linear fashion, and then spelled out with"flashcards" two seconds later in case anyone was still too dense tounderstand (e.g. say wolf, then show a picture of a wolf on thescreen...show a book she wants, then two scenes later show her in thelibrary...gee, thanks, i wouldn't have understood without thespoon-feeding). I think this movie was meant for 12 year olds or peopleof very low intelligence. They should show movies like this to filmstudents and do play by plays, "OK, here's how NOT to shoot ascene/edit a movie...." How do studios actually give people with notalent money to make crap movies like this??? Do yourself a favor: Gosee "Let The Right One In" instead. That is, if you have an IQ over 80.
