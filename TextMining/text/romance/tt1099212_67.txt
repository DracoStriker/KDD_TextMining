All i am going to write is my private opinion and i don't claim it tobe facts Till that movie came out the movie "Blood Rayne" was my worstmovie ever benchmark but this movie actually was even worse....Even leaving aside that the movie defiantly was made for little teenagegirls its still bad and i mean really bad. I never read the books so ionly talking about the movie here... and the plot was not worthmentioning. The whole story was merely excuse to create moments ofartificial feelings...i mean i really wouldn't have been surprised ifsuddenly one of those "applause" sign style thingies would have lightenup telling the audience what to feel or what the terrible acting wassupposed to transmit.. They could have saved about 30% filming time ifthey would have replaced half the so called "love scenes" with a stillshot of Bella and Edward starring at each other.And why the hell were those "things" called vampire...they had more incommon with a gnome, a dragon, a troll or for that matte a gay buttdemon then with vampires...sunlight makes them sparkle?? who the hellcame up with that. Vampires are supposed to blood thirsty, man hating,vicious, terrifying beasts that think of humans as nothing more thenfood and they defiantly don't sparkle...everBy the way...am i the only one thinking Edward is a pedophile...i meanhe's about 10 times older Bella...
