I am an avid reader of Twilight. I recommend it to everyone I know. Iwas at the midnight showing just like a lot of you, and as I sat thereand watched the movie that seemed to hardly try to follow the amazingbook. I left the theater wanting to have not gone. I wish I would havenever seen the movie. To me they made a story that is so inspiring andfull of love and turned it into a full fledged comedy. They mockedEdward and his inner turmoil. They made it "funny". Oh I just get somad thinking about this movie. Wouldn't have hurt to try to actuallyfollow the book since you used the name and such. Just one opinion of a huge Twilight BOOK fan! Hope ya'll liked it.
