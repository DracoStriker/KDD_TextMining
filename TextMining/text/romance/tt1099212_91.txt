What can one say at the complete lack of talent that CatherineHardwicke has manifested throughout her career?Twilight is no exception. The entire movie is dedicated to the task of making Catherine Hardwickeappear "cool" to her Hollywood mentors. She still can't shoot anything properly, electing time and again toshake the camera when she doesn't know what to do with it and herskills at selecting editing choices is still completely below par,again trying to appear "hip" instead of trying to achieve quality.Worse than in her previous films is the casting. At least her earlyfilms had some good actors in them. Twilight is peopled with dead-eyedmodel-types who clearly had to have slept through their acting classes.Of course, there is little doubt they were selected because they looked"cool", which is the modus operandi of Ms. Hardwicke.As long as Hollywood will keep throwing money at this bad director, itwill continue to be in deep trouble.
