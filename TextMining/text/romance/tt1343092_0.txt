After seeing this film I was more than a little disgusted to see somany negative reviews. The main problem with this film I find is in thefirst 20-30 minutes, a common problem I spy in Luhrman films thatshould by no means define an entire film. Giving away nothing the filmbegins at a brisk and overly flamboyant pace but after a bit it hitswhat I like to call "Baz's golden point", slows to absolute perfection.That first half hour will leave more than a few shaking their heads,but power through it and you will find The Great Gatsby in all itsglory. Luhrman stays as true to the source as he can and Dicaprio givesyet another glorious performance. If I'm going to be honest I think alot of the negative reviews coming in are due to the "classic" statusof the book, people want to act like the hours of school discussionsshould make this film less fanciful and serious 100 percent of thetime. Thing is we have that version twice over in the 1974 & 2000adaption. Gatsby 2013 is beautiful, over the top, heart wrenching, andthoroughly enjoyable flick that I shall always highly recommend.
