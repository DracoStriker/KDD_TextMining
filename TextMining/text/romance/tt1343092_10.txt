The movie starts with a guy who makes many expensive parties in hismansion, to get the presence of the girl he has always been in lovewith. 1.- It never explains why he can't just go to her, which the bookdoes. This makes an awful ridiculousness of "Why didn't he just go toher?" for years. 2.- After he finally meets her, the entire plot forENTIRE 30 MINUTES is about her not being able to make up her mind aboutGatsby or her husband. 3.- The "climax" of the story is when Daisy'shusband discovers he used to be poor. He breaks out in rage, and Daisygets scared. That's it. Most of the story wouldn't mean much withoutthe visuals, and most of the reviews were obviously bought. The onlything that makes the movie bearable was Leonardo Di Caprio'sperformance. The characters' entire importance and ego based onmaterialism and money are justified not with interesting deep stories,but with plain image and the love Gatsby felt to "give her everything",implying a love story strongly based on materialism.
