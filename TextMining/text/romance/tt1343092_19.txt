This movie is DOA, a victim of the colossal misjudgment of whoeverthought The Great Gatsby would be a suitable vehicle for 3-D specialeffects and tried to turn it into a showcase for them. At best they addnothing to this subtle and complex classic and at worst they distractthe viewer from the novelist's intent, masking every other theme of thenovel behind a garish attempt to overwhelm the viewer with with astylized vision of the roaring twenties. The actors struggling tocompete with this distraction and bring Fitzgerald's characters andthemes to life are at a serious disadvantage before they even appear,and Leonardo DiCaprio simply isn't up to the task. His seems to bealternately trying to channel Robert Redford and Marlon Brando, theformer being an improvement and the later a particularly inappropriatesource of confusion about the character. Gatsby is supposed to be anenigma, but this is ridiculous. And when those resources seem unable tosustain him, he drifts off into something more reminiscent of OrsonWells, an impersonation that is way out beyond his ability, though inharmony with his bloated and dissipated appearance. The silly device ofscattering bits of text into the snow or rain and then assembling themto float in front in front of the screen is no competition for SamWaters sensitive reading of the same texts. The interjection of apsychoanalytical frame story to explicate Nick's character would betotally unnecessary if a more suitable and capable actor than TobeyMaguire had been cast. I went home and watched the 1974 version, whichI had underestimated. In contrast Sam Waters, Robert Redford and KarenBlack were nothing less than brilliant. Poor Fitzgerald. What adisservice. But the novel is pretty much indestructible and will liveto fight another day, even if it lost this battle.
