Let me start by saying I have not read the book or seen the 74 filmversion. I came to this film with only one preconception; that I wasgoing to be watching a flamboyant piece set in the 20's.The costumes and sets are stunning, I did not mind the editing, butdoing the Charleston to music that was out of time with the dance moveswas where I finally drew the line and switched off.The music was awful not because it is modern music thrown into a periodpiece but mostly because it is out of time with the editing andmovements on screen. It felt like the music soundtrack was producedindependently to any of the film making process and then just addedwithout any direction.Confused how this happened I even thought to myself "are they trying tobe clever and creating an improvised jazz feel of the period". But evenin improvised Jazz the musicians take their cues from one another,whoever added the soundtrack did so without any cues from this film.It's a shame no one with any sense of timing was involved in the makingof this film.
