Well now, I was taken aback by how tragically bad this movie was. Letme start with some positive things before I go on berating it. First,visually this movie is captivating beyond words. Now I went and saw itin 3D (not necessary) and I think it would have been better in astandard format. Now the acting. I felt like everyone acted their partwell, aside from Toby McGuire who has such an unlikable feature for me(his acting) that I wish he could just disappear from cinemaaltogether. The female parts were just.. OKAY, they felt a littlewatered down for me. Really I honestly enjoyed the book, and have likedone or two of the film adaptations that were done in the past but thisone just missed it completely. You cant put Leonardo DiCaprio, in thelead role and it automatically makes the film good, although I thinkthat may be some directors thoughts. The pacing in the movie is justweird. Its like you are literally getting all of the sour parts of thebook, being pumped up by some visual effects, trying their best to wooyou over. Well needless to say at 2hrs and 20 min, it completely missedme. The Dialogue seems patched together and last minute, none of itever seems generic. But WORST OF ALL is the MUSIC.... I absolutely cannot stand non period music in a period film. For instance, the movietakes place in the 20's and they have Jay-z and "Dub step" slatheredall over this thing. And its so thick you feel like your drenched in itby the time you leave the theater. In all honesty, this film was onethat I wanted to leave half way through, and by the time the endcredits rolled I wished that I had. Don't see it, and sure as hell doNOT waste your money and pay too much by going to a theater.
