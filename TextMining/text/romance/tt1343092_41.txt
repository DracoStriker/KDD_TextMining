Great Gatsby, what is so great about it? I was trying not to fallasleep but it was impossible. The movie is a waste of your time andmoney. Go watch some romantic comedy instead i am sure you will enjoyedit a lot more. THis is by far the worst movie of Leo, who deservesbetter movies. THis are 2 hours of my life that I will never get back!There is absolutely nothing in this movie that is interesting , so youare hoping that some twist anything will happen, but nothing happens.And the music, the story is in 1920s' and in the background is Jay Zand some commercial music of today. I would rather go to school thanwatch this movie. I hope that review helps someone and he wont have tosuffer as much as i did.
