First off, I read this book while in school, and I loved it throughoutthe whole thing, and the movie was just as good, if not better than thebook. The way they added the beyond over the top aspect made the movieso much fun to watch. It was a visually stunning masterpiece, withgreat effects, a great cast, and a great story behind it. My friendsand I were sitting in the theater absolutely stunned by how great Theacting was from everyone involved. Leonardo Dicaprio delivers a greatperformance as Gatsby, Tobey Maguire did great as Nick Carraway andCarey Mulligan was great as Daisy Buchanan. Baz Luhrman did a great jobbringing this amazing book to the big screen.
