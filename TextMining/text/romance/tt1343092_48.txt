For a while yesterday I'd been wondering whether or not to postponegoing to see The Great Gatsby, tempted as I was by the significantamounts of blue sky and sunshine outside. Once the film started, andfor the next two hours and twenty something minutes, my thoughts neveronce strayed to the weather outside. Within minutes of the start I,like Nick Carraway (the film's narrator), was being drawn into thesumptuously glamorous world of 1920's New York high society. The filmmaking is simply astounding. At times the screen seemed filled fromcorner to corner with both elegance and frivolity. This is, however, afilm that's most certainly not 'all visual spectacle' though. Severalof the film's main characters were developed in sufficient detail toallow me to form meaningful opinions about them. Without wishing togive away too much, I found The Great Gatsby to have elements of a lovestory, a tragedy and (last but not least) a critique of a way of lifehaving strong parallels with what is happening (in certain sections ofsociety) in present times. Acting and cinematography are top notch. The3D is cool. Some of my favourite actors and actresses are in it(DeCaprio, Isla Fisher) as well as some new ones I was impressed by(Elizabeth Debicki). Oh, and did I mention the music? I was the lastperson out of the auditorium. I simply had to stay and listen 'til thevery end of the credits just to hear as much as possible of the amazingmusical score. (Make sure you stay for Sia Furler singing Kill and Runat the very end of the credits.) OK. I think I've prattled on enough. Iloved it and can't wait to see it again before it ends its run. Filmsdon't come better than this (at least for me that is).
