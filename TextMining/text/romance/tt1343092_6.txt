For the record, I've read Gatsby at least every other year since I was17, so, believe me when I say I have been counting down the days andminutes until the new movie opened.Here it goes then, I saw Gatsby last night and......absolutely lovedit! In retrospect (as in halfway through the movie), it just clicked,Leonardo was perfect. He wasn't Redford, but in my humble opinion,better! He nailed it, portraying Gatsby as this truly multi-dimensionalcharacter. At first, we're introduced to Gatsby, the well-rehearsed oldsport telling his canned story about studying at Oxford, Montenegromedals, etc. etc., but then slowly that forced veneer peels away, andhe gives us this angsty, desperate, so-happy-in-love, we can remake thepast, tortured soul. Much, much better than Redford. And, the same goeswith Daisy. Mia Farrow's Daisy was all flighty and light as a feather,pretty pathetic and self-absorbed, you wonder, what's the big deal withthis woman who everyone loves....but with Carey Mulligan, you get it.The scenes of the two of them as young lovers explain it all. Finally,Tobey McGuire....I love him as Peter Parker, Homer Wells and now NickCarraway. I thought the idea of having him author Gatsby from ahospital was very clever, allowed him to read long passages directlyfrom the book. As for Jay-Z et al., I really didn't mind it, as far asI was concerned, it didn't distract and certainly worked to illuminatethe frenetic energy of the 20's. Please, give it another try, see itagain. From my experience, a Baz Luhrmann movie is always better thesecond time around (Moulin Rogue).
