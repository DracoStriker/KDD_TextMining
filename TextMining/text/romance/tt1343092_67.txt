This is by far the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. There areno storyline. Nothing happens in the entire movie. Watching paint dryis more entertaining. Its hard to even imaging how boring the authormust have been. Some guy live in a house with a neighbor named Gatsby.Thats it. There are no story being told thus its impossible to writeany spoilers. How someone could get the idea to spend money on making amovie of such a dull book is bizarre. This movie should be banned fromcinema and the makers fined for abuse of the audience. I thoughttorture was illegal bur apparently abusing the audience with this islegal. Makes me sick.
