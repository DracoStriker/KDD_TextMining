DiCaprio? Really? This entire film is an abomination and a blasphemouscorruption of one of the greatest works of American literature. Puttingan actor like DiCaprio in it just adds insult to injury. There isbarely any connection between this rock video style film and F. ScottFitzgerald's novel. The movie is trash and shouldn't share the title ofthat masterpiece. Of course, does anyone read anymore or do they relyupon no- talent actors and sensationalist directors to interpretliterature so they may spare those precious hours required to actuallyenjoy a book for video games, cell phones, and reality television? Onething is certain. Fitzgerald isn't rolling over in his grave inresponse to this garbage. He's nodding knowingly.
