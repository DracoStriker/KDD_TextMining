I had heard a lot of people say this movie sucked. I actually enjoyedthis film more than I thought I was going to.The director has a very stylized concept for his films. The fact thatit is not set in present day does not mean it has to be a period piece.Everything was over the top and to me it didn't feel out of place sincethey needed to portray their lavish lifestyle.It was all around well cast. The chemistry between Daisy and Gatsby wasamazing. You could feel the lost love between them and their desire tobe together. The emotions were felt on an almost personal level for me.The character of Tom was exactly who you wanted him to be. Tobey hadthe difficult task for playing the straight man. The main narrative whoshows no motives throughout the entire film was executed with subtlegestures.Keep an open mind, and you might like it.
