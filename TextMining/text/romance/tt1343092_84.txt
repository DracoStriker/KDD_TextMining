One reviewer stated "Eye candy that reflects the emptiness of Americanculture". What if the director wanted us to feel disgusted about themovie...like Toby's character did. Like a dark joke. It's the only wayI can understand why such movie was created. No. I'm not in shock. Intrance - maybe. I just FINISHED watching the movie, but I'm stillwaiting for it to begin. Really, the characters and scenes were soshallow, that I caught myself laughing in disbelief at a few scenes.Like the one when Gatsby was contemplating the happy moments withDaisy. Wtf. Contemplating what? -You throwing clothes at her from thebalcony? There is no connection, no depth. Just ADHD. I don't know...take some medicine, or drill a hole in your skull to rewire it beforewatching this movie. It might help you make sense of it, or feel someempathy for the characters.
