I was excited to see this version of The Great Gatsby, especially afterreading the mostly glowing reviews. I was expecting a film that wouldbring me back to that unique period in American culture.After about 45 minutes, it reminded me of Moulin Rouge, which I hated.I hadn't made the connection that both films were made by the samedirector. Overblown, ridiculous party scenes, no real structure norstory, basically just a mess. After realizing this and watching oneparty scene after another with emphasis on the fireworks, etc. I foundmyself,losing interest in the film. I felt the characters weren'tdeveloped and the whole structure of the film was off. I kept asking mywife if she liked the film, hoping I could use her lack of interest asan excuse to turn it off. We both eventually fell asleep not evenhalfway through and I hope she doesn't want to finish it. How this gotsuch glowing reviews is beyond me. This interpretation of one of thegreat American novels was a disgrace and making it almost 3 hours longdoesn't help either.
