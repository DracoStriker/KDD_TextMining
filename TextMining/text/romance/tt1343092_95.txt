Well, Hollywood doesn't disappoint once again. With complete self -indulgence and CGI opulence, they destroy, what they could neverconceive. They over-compensate, in the void of decent script writers,with predictable smarmy vomit, garnished lovingly with an invocation ofrap, betwixt the 20's themed soundtrack. Dreadful stuff. Thank God for fast forward & scene changer features.The only thing that surprised me was they didn't somehow incorporateZombies into the story-line. After all, why not? Who cares? WarnerBros. picks up a tidy $375 Million + in world wide distribution, theculturally indoctrinated get their mind candy and F. Scott Fitzgeraldgets to roll over in his grave once more. Of all the mysteries in this world of confusion, I am continuallystymied as to why the ISIS & al-Qaeda types, have not 'yet' targetedthe global center of debauchery. Not that I wish them any harm, but atleast they might get a script out of it, worthy of their ineptitude.ps. I really miss guys like Alfred Hitchcock & Victor Fleming
