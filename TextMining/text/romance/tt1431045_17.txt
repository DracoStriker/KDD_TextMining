Its an overrated movie with curses written by some 12 year old. Nostory, no real plot, the film could have done without the villain. Thisfilm deserves a 5 or 6 stars at the highest. The reason I am giving ita 1 is due to its over rating. The film mainly attract audiences of16-25 years. Just a cash grab film. Simply marvel's worst. And there'sthe feminism there. The heroine always has to save the hero now. Ryan'sacting was good in this movie. It suited him. The cgi wasn't bad. Butif this movie were to come out before the Iron man then it would've got4-5 stars. There are some marvel films which deserve higher ratinginstead of this movie .
