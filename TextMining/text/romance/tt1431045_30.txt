I first saw this movie with the highest of expectations. I quicklyrealized that I had placed an overabundance of faith in my friends andrelatives opinions of a movie. Not only did my opinions of Deadpoolquickly change from a 8/10 to a 1/10, but my opinion of my friends andrelatives was brought to the same lows. I truly love comic books andhave always been a massive fan of both marvel and DC, but after seeingthis movie, I have had to take a step back and reconsider not only thegenre, but my faith in other people. If people truly believe this movieto be anything above a 1/10 or anything other than a complete disasterthat clearly was designed for teenage boys or 30 year olds that stilllive with their parents and spend the entirety of their "allowance" onvideo games and snacks. I would love to have anything positive to sayabout this movie, but if I said anything nice Tha. This or gave areview any higher, I would be lying.
