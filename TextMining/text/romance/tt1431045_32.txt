Let me begin by saying that I am a Marvel fan. Maybe I wasn't preparedfor what I was about to watch. I was later told that this characterexists in the comic books. Even so, I don't understand why. I found thecharacter completely stupid and tasteless. I mean, really really stupidand really really tasteless. Why be so grotesque really? Maybe thecharacter from the book was just like this. There is being funny andswearing and being funny doing it. This movie goes way beyond that. Itis idiotic and I really can't understand the high ratings.
