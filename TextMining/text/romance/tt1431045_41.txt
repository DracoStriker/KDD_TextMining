A friend told to watch this movie and assured me that I would love itsince I love all the other Marvel movies and TV-series. I think I hadthe strength to watch 15-20 minutes before I was completely disgustedof how really really bad this is. How in the name of all that's holy has this movie got this high rating?The last hour and twenty minutes of the movie I actually was forced tofast forward the movie to stop me from putting my fingers in TV's wallsocket. I rather play with my sisters tweezers pulling my own noosehair than to even speak about this movie again.Please, what ever you do, don't see this movie. Save that time forsomething more useful. And Mr. Reynolds, I will forgive you this time, and forget that youever did this movie. I'm now going to put soap in my eyes to help washaway anything that's left of the memory of this big pile of monkey poo.
