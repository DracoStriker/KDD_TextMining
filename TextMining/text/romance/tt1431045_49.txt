Im actually quite surprised on how this movie goes well. BUT, THEratings didn't do well on it's release, Like it had 6 - 6.9 rating moreor less on the 1st week and so weeks go on. Then it became to 8 now.It's actually good though. I really recommend it. To be honest,Deadpool is playing as Ryan Reynolds. The character really fitsperfectly for Reynolds, performance 10/10, acting 10/10, humor 10/10. Ican't wait for another movie and I hope it's 2h30m long, The movie isreally worth a penny.
