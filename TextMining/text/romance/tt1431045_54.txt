It's is a fun ride. This is not a typical superhero movie. It can't be100% possible in real life but who cares. The movie is for the grown-ups, and they made sure all the fun was in there. Ryan Reynolds got abreakthrough role here. He is definitely the cool guy not for the badguys want to be around. The actress is great too. Beautiful as she is,she can be a naughty, and it was a great joy to watch. She and Reynoldhad such good chemistry together. The movie is fast pace and the actionscenes are great. This superhero definitely deserves a sequel.
