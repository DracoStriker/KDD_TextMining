Here's an inventively original super hero comedy, unfortunately not onefor kiddies. I expected laughs all through, but was sold short on that,where instead, they come in durations, and ones of some prettyhysterical s..t, but too, it's very smart humor, thanks to lines from ascreenwriter, you have to envy, because they're that good. From theopening credits, of originality, you have to admire, played against an80's track, you do not expect, and the opening scene, you've got oneloud, clever superhero flick, with some gruesome moments, mind you, asrevengeful Reynolds, now donning a bland Spiderman looking costume, isafter the badarse Skein ( who makes a great English villain, toppingReynold's performance easily) who horribly disfigured his beautifulbaby face, where he's wears the congressional medal of ugly, where thatbig guy from Fantastic Four doesn't look that bad. That's sheer motive,to go after and kill his guy. The movie starts, half point of story,which is clever, where we rewind, to find out Reynold's life, prefore,to his little misfortune, where he was a kind of secret vigilante,working for an secret agency. He has a hot girlfriend, but his health'snot that good. I was pretty happy from what Deadpool delivered, betteron a second watch. It was just the laugh factor, that let me down. It'sa smartly original film, where Reynolds, who like Charlie Sheen, hasgreat comic timing, and I did like the way he played it, despite notbeing Oscar attraction. The girlfriend, but it's Skein you'll remember.The young superhero girl, who with Reynold's old protégé, a bigmonstrous Fantastic 4 figure, helps him dispose of this evil, lookslike that creepy hate driven girl in The Crush. There's a nice V.Oafter note that ends this ambitious piece of film making too. A mustsee, again, not for the kiddies.
