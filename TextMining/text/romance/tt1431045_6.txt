I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar withDeadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory,unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy,where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as acomedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing thischaracter.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meantto be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant withaction, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitablefor children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based oncomics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been farmore successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry,but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make itwithout blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers anddirectors are too worried about political correctness in their movies.That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so manymovies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watchingit, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.
