When I watch this in theaters I love it. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool isgold like good comedy, good action, and got dead pool right. This filmis definitely better than Fant4stic (2015) and in my conclusion is whythey got this movie right but got that Fantastic four movie wrong likewhy is that? At least it's an apology to that one train wreck he havein 2015. But this film is what I would recommend.
