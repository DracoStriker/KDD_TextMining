What a highly stupid and terrible film. Not worth the money that isspent making such rubbish. Also ... should be rated 18. Not suitablefor kids at all.A thousand shades of terrible. I'm actually beyond words at what peoplethink is funny nowadays. It's not funny, there's no point to it at all.I'm literally on the verge of giving up watching anything anymore thatis deemed as a comedy. What's funny about someone running around withmindless violence, looking like a burns victim. Best person in it wasthe taxi driver. Oh and here's a thing ... since when does cancerbelong in a comedy.Don't bother wasting your time with this pap! Take out all sex,swearing and violence and what's left .... Marvel should be ashamed ofthemselves ??
