"Deadpool" was billed as a superhero movie for adults. I was skepticalabout that claim, because I'm still not convinced that those two termsaren't mutually exclusive. I've seen it now, and as near as I can tell,"adult" really means that it's got a dirtier mouth and more graphicviolence, which makes me despair a bit about the state of adulthood inAmerica. But I will say that I enjoyed it much more than any superheromovie in recent memory, because it's actually funny and doesn't takeitself seriously. But that's also fairly faint praise, because I'vepretty much given up on superhero movies and can't even remember thelast one I saw.Ryan Reynolds can be very funny, but he can also be very annoying, andhe's about equal parts both in this film. The movie has a potty mouththat is mostly used to clever and witty effect, and some gratuitousnudity is always a-OK with me. But what kept me from really enjoyingthis film was the casual violence, much of it played for laughs. Iguess this is where the "adult" thing comes in, because I just can'tfind myself enjoying the gun fetishism in a movie like this. The actualgun problems in the real world are too immediate and too concerning tome to be able to relax into the fantasy of a movie like this, and mystomach curdles at the thought of the whooping and hollering that Ihave no doubt went on in audiences of this film as the bullets and theblood flew.And though there was talk, however brief, about this film actuallygetting some Oscar attention, that talk was ridiculous. Nothing aboutthis movie was that good.Grade: B-
