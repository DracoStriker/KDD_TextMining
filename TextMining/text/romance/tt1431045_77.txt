I think Deadpool didn't choose what sort of film it would like to be.It lacks enthusiasm and sounds moree like a TV SERIES allowing me tocut in between and watch. it the next day. 4 weeks in a row in boxoffice weekend rates made me expect greatness. The love story thatfaced unreal problems, the non-scary hunting process, the 'neverhappening' sacrifices he made, the characters who lacked identities,... and so on, was lame. I could say it was a from a high school kid'simagination who is looking for the love of his life. The story says'..after he had accelerated healing power, he decided to hunt who manwho destroyed his life'. 'Healing power' was not over whelming andsimply 'hunting' the man who made me look like the worst thing on earthwasn't a great idea. After all, it was a successful business. 'A' forthe talent of Ryan Reynolds and his sense of humor.
