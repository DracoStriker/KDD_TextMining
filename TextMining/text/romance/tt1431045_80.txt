A wise-cracking gun for hire finds love in the underworld, but cancerrobs him of his bliss - until he strikes a devilish bargain with agene-mutating doctor.Stuffed with gags about the movie process, gets tiring, and a couple ofsuperhero characters are thrown in because ... the IP rights weregranted by the studio. Don't have to look far for the problem: writtenand produced by the same guys responsible for the overworked wordfestthat was Zombieland. And again they chose a whining, self-satisfiedlead actor.The intro is interesting, action pacy, but the formula keeps repeatinguntil the editing runs out of imagination and a giant sigh of boredomis released at about the hour mark.Music is standard, with the worrying fact that a teen movie keepsharping back to stuff from 30 years ago. And the unfunniest postcredits gag ever. Yes, you will gag.Surprised they didn't include a midget in a clown suit and an ugly pet.Plus the boob cover up was pure, "How much can't we get away with -hehehe!" Overall: Lots of energy, but tiresome. Like Saturday Night Live.
