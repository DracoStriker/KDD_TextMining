I think Ryan Reynolds has officially redeemed himself from his previoustwo blunders as a superhero. While I do wish the movie took morechances, what we got was still a great movie. It's funny,action-packed, and undeniably Deadpool. Just to give you some contextas to why I like this movie so much, it's the first Marvel movie I'vebeen invested in since "Spider-Man 3". I didn't care for any of theIron Man movies, I don't care about the Thor, Captain America,Guardians of the Galaxy, or the X-Men movies, and I certainly don'tcare about any of the 900 superhero crossovers that are in the works.All I wanted was a stand-alone superhero movie that could stand on it'sown two feet without having 6 heroes in it, and this delivered. Thestory's simple to follow, a little too simple, but for the first inwhat I'm guessing will be a series, they did a great job here.
