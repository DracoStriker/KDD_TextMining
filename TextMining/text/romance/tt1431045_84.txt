This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fightsbad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductoryscene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confrontshis foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe heshould join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks howformer soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is lookingfor Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were lookingup for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planningto get married? then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothingleft to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' whotells him that he could be better than better? a superhero. Smithdelivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get farworse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cellshe does indeed recover and becomes immortal? he is also so horrificallydisfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes butbelieves that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks sois determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for ashock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with takingenemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerousfoes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed andfrequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily beoff-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. Thestory isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action isgreat and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; RyanReynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask ofprosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajaxand Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I reallyenjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.
