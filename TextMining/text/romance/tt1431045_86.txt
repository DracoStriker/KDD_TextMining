Unique character whose sense of humor is appreciated. Those togetherand a fairly good story would have made this movie better than mostsuperhero fare of late. But, the sheer number of references to DICKS dropped my rating by 4points. Dragging out sad, tired punched-in-the balls gags, one- linersabout dicks, penis, constant mention of masturbation, hand gestures,lots of un-sexy sex on repeat, and DAMN just IN YOUR FACE DICK DICKDICK. It got old quick. It just seemed obvious to me that the movie was aimed boys in theearliest stage of puberty, which is too bad because it could have had awider appeal. That his GF worked in a strip-club (as a waitress, yeahbig diff) hit the limit of my patience. It's too bad guys will get theidea they could rank such a gorgeous woman, because no woman would putup with such a juvenile personality, much less share it herself. (Tothose, here's a warning: no GF worth having appreciates a boy- man whostill lives with his mom and plays games all day. Pure comic bookfantasy - which I'm sure somebody will write one day). There was so much wrong with this whole setup. I mean, I was ready toget into this movie for the unique elements, such as the anti-hero bit,humor, experiments gone wrong, etc. Then I realized it was just a bunch of boys in a circle jerk, touchingeach other, then all laughing their heads off after the awkwardnesssubsides and they start farting. If you're not 11, it's gross to watchthen just pitiful to remember.
