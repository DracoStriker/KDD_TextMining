This movie was not funny, it was not exciting, and the plot was so badthat you could just say it was plot less. This is easily the worstmovie i have seen so far this year out of about fifth-teen movies intotal. I'd say that is more than enough to warrant the rating of a one.The jokes completely lacked creativity. They were just crude and veryjuvenile. It was like a twelve year old trying to be as offensive aspossible. Yeah, they're saying some stupid and offensive stuff, butthey're still only 12 years old so they're not very good at it. Any anyon stage comedian i've ever heard is about twenty times more creativeand offensive.
