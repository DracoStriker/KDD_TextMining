Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has cancer and undergoes a procedure byAjax (Ed Skrein) to cure him of the cancer, and it gives him superpowers. The idea was to make Wilson a superhero who can be auctionedoff to the highest bidder for other mercenary work, but he escapes fromAjax. The main problem is that his face changed to something hideousand he is afraid to confront girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Henow calls himself Deadpool, and he needs to find Ajax who he believescan reverse the procedure and make him normal looking again. What was good: the action scenes with generous compliments of CGI isspectacular and very creative. Kudos. The acting was good whendialogues weren't being too silly.What was bad: Silly childish dialogues mostly from Deadpool, toilethumor, F-bombs and other disgusting sexual language. To be fair,sometimes Deadpool's humor was spot on. I said "sometimes."Deadpool gets X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic TeenageWarhead (Brianna Hildebrand) to help him defeat Ajax.Notable: Leslie Uggums as Blind Al.The movie would have been better if much of the bad stuff above wastoned back a lot. The way this was presented was too over the top andbordered on being most annoying and childish, at times.This movie has taught me to be wary of Marvel comics presentations tothe big screen. They just go too far with language and toilet humor andnow we can add silly dialogues. This was disappointing. (3/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, one time in the beginning. Nudity: Yes at agirlie bar. Language: Yes. Rating: D
