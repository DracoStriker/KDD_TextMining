yeah, deadpool, you think he is an anarcho punk with lots of cooljokes. well think again. the story in the film is quite lame. hero getshurt by villain. hero seeks revenge. villain takes the girlfriend ofthe hero. hero saves her and the live prosper for the rest of theirlives. this could come from Disney, so conservative is the plot. andthe most funny jokes you've already seen in the trailer. and when thehero will heal himself every time, there is no place for suspense nordrama. the mediocre rap music cant help it eithernot as funny as "super" or "kick ass", and highly overrated. no goodsidekicks or villains, boring and slow in the middle, expected muchmore.
