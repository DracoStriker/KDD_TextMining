After seeing the trailer a million times at theaters I was lookingforward to seeing Crazy Stupid Love as it has one of my favorite actorsin it, Julianne Moore. It looked to me like a smart romantic comedy foradults with a bit of an edge, which is exactly what it is, the story isfresh and appeals to a broad age range, the Steve Carrell/JulianneMoore storyline appeals to the older married demographic and the RyanGosling/ Emma Stone storyline appeals to the younger hipper generation.Steve Carrell gives a terrific performance as the poor guy whose lifejust seems to go from bad to worse, I think he will be nominated for agolden globe or something like that, he is a very funny guy to watch nomatter what role he is in, the rest of the cast is fine also, MissMoore once again proves she us an actress with a spectacular, RyanGosling and Emma Stone have excellent chemistry together which makesthem entirely believable as lovers, however one person steals the showand that is Marisa Tomei in all her nutty glory, her scenes areexceptionally funny but they are too few and far between.This movie does have it's flaws, the end twist is too far fetched andunbelievable, I think it would have been better if they gave you someclues as to how the story all comes together in the end, theGosling/Stone relationship isn't given enough time to make you reallycare, and also it's a tad too long. But other than that this is a nice,funny and overall enjoyable film to watch.
