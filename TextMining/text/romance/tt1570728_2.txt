You know usually I'm not into romantic comedies, as I find that most ofthem fall short & are extremely cheesy. I really liked this moviethough. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great.Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel forthem in their individual situations. Usually when I think of SteveCarell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenesthough, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, RyanGosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays aladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet aftersplitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry togetherand provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just sawthis movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almostnever happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute.This movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most peoplewould enjoy it. 9/10!
