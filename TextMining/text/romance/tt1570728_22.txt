Somehow the makers of this movie took two of my favorite actors -Julianne Moore and Ryan Gosling - and made them so phony and annoyingthat I could barely watch; and they magnified all of Steve Carell'smost annoying traits so that he was even more obnoxious than usual. Idon't think it was supposed to be that way, based on other people'sreviews, but that's how it hit me.I guess Carell fans love anything he does; gasp with amazement any timehe manages to cry or to read a line without making a funny face or afunny noise, and tell themselves what a great dramatic actor he is inaddition to being the funniest man in the world; and they probablydon't care or even notice how anybody else comes across. That's theonly way I can account for the vast multitudes who rave about howprofound (huh?) this silly, irritating movie is and how phenomenal(awesome, anybody?) Carell is in it. I don't get it, but then I'mobviously not a fan.And I'm sick of movies that get laughs from pubescent boys gettingcaught doing what they all do in their rooms any time they're alone andof angst-ridden teenage crushes on older men/women. Those two dumbthemes have been done to death.To summarize this review: this is a stupid, boring, obnoxious andannoying movie that wastes at least two great talents in a stupid,clichéd story about stupid, totally obnoxious and unbelievablecharacters.
