I saw this movie some time ago, but never got around to reviewing itfor some reason. Anyways, like I said in the description, this isdefinitely one of the best romantic comedies I think has ever beenmade. The actors portray their characters wonderfully, and thecharacters themselves are just so well written and gave depth to them.The dialogue in and the writing is hilarious where it needs to be andtouching and heartwarming where it needs to be. Julianne Moore andSteve Carell have undeniable chemistry between each other, and thatchemistry is definitely electric and alive. Also Julianne Moore is sohilarious here, she made me cry with laughter in several scenes. SteveCarrel is perfect here, no other actor could've done this characterjustice like he did. Also Marisa Tomei was very funny even though shewasn't in a lot of the movie. This movie is definitely not shallow,it's very deep with a lot of that subject matter and it really showshow intelligent the writing is. The comedy is top niche and the writingand acting is also of the highest possible quality. Ryan gosling andEmma stone do their jobs well and carry their characters all of theirown. Stone and gosling also have great chemistry with each other, andthat works well. There really isn't any downsides or negatives to thismovie. I can't think of anything that didn't work well. 10/10 for CrazyStupid Love.
