I kind of liked the movie, but it could have been so much better.Acting for this type of movie was above par, especially because of someof the convoluted aspects to the script. Must have been difficult forthe actors to keep a straight face with all the shenaingans going on.SPOILER ALERT: What drove me crazy about STUPID, CRAZY, LOVE was the'twist'. Come on now. Don't the screenwriter's read what they write?How could it be possible that the character of Ryan Gosling doesn'tconnect the name WEAVER with the characters of Steve Carrell and EmmaStone? How come we never see or hear of Steve and Julianne Moore talkof their grown daughter. Don't even know they had one until the bigdenouncemnet scene. Sloppy writing for sure. Also, how ironic is itthat Steve's one-night stand with the Marisa Tomei character justhappens to be one of his sons teachers!!!! Speaking of his son and thatof the babysitter...that whole plot should have been nixed. Very creepyand strange. Too, bad, because this movie had potential, but someonereally blew it. And what about the scene with Steve falling asleep inRyan's naked crotch??? Very homoerotic and did not belong in this movieat all. One of the best things about the movie, however, is MarisaTomei. Too bad she was short changed into just a cameo. The movie needmore of Tomei and less convolution. Still an OK to spend 118 minutes ifone has nothing else to do.
