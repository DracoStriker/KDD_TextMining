Crazy, Stupid, Love is a rom-com that gathers all the codes, clichésand stereotypes of the genre.Yet, the acting is perfect, there is a good chemistry between Goslingand Carell, and one can easily empathize or sympathize with one of thecharacters. The script relies on a basic story, but well developed,dynamic, without overlong passages; the dialogues are well written witha good dose of humor. The cinematography is also quite good, as dynamicas the script.All in all, this movie turns out to be enjoyable, withoutrevolutionizing anything.
