Crazy Stupid Love: Perfect 10\10. This is how Rom-Coms should be. I hada whale of a time watching this movie. Steve Carell is such a terrificactor. He completely owns this movie, sad to see he dint get anyrecognition/awards for it. The entire cast is perfect.Ryan Gosling islikable as a womanizer who picks up girls in bars. Steve Carell is aman in his mid 40's who has been recently divorced. Ryan Gosling is theone who helps him out with his midlife crisis and infuses some of hisskills into him . Its a brilliant parody of the American culture.The dialogs are witty ,screenplay is crisp. Its been a long time i had so much fun whilewatching a movie.You should not miss this out for any reason.As i said : 10\10. Couldn't have asked for anything more or better.
