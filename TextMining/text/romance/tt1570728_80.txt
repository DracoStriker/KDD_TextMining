A formidable cast have come together and provided us with what can onlybe described as a man's chick flick. It doesn't follow the formula seenso many times before. The main couple's relationship has already hitits peak. It comes crashing down within seconds when Emily (Moore) saysto her husband Cal (Carell) that she's slept with someone else andwants a divorce. This is a punch in the gut for every loving couple outthere. Crazy, Stupid, Love follows Cal dealing with what's hit him andthe relationships that surround him, including his son's love for hisbabysitter (he's 13, she's 17) and Ryan Gosling, the womaniser he meetsat a bar he drowns his sorrows in. Gosling's steers Cal into the worldof the single man. Gosling is at the forefront of every scene he's in,up until the point he falls in love. It's lighthearted and fun up untilit ups the severity. Smaller parts from Tomei and Bacon add flare tothis heartwarming film. Apart from a little straying off, CSL is strongenough to be the best romantic-comedy out there because of itsdifferences and loving characters.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk
