I wanted to see this film when it came out at the cinema with a memberof support staff who worked at the house I moved to shortly before itwas released but due to staff shortage, I didn't get to see it untiltoday when I rented the DVD. The reason I wanted to see this film inthe first place is because there aren't many romantic comedies thatfocus on couples getting a divorce, so its theme of Emily wanting adivorce from Cal was one of the film's strongest points. While this hasmore strengths than weaknesses, I was somewhat disappointed with thefilm's length being a little too long for my liking, the dialogue beingclichéd in parts, particularly within the first half, and the unevenpacing.Further to the film's concept, the acting was well done and mostlysubtle. While the script had its clichéd moments and pop culturereferences to Twilight and Dirty Dancing, it had sound funny parts,especially about a female character's PG-13 life (possibly afourth-wall joke relating to the film's certification in the USA); thefilm had some creative cinematography, particularly the shots of Cal'shead covering Jacob's privates while they're in a locker room and theclose-up shots of Jessica applying her make-up before taking nudeselfies; and there was also a decent soundtrack with funky,contemporary and emotive snippets of incidental music and some pleasantif forgettable songs. The best songs for me were Goldfrapp's 'Ooh LaLa,' 'I've Had the Time of My Life' from Dirty Dancing, SpandauBallet's 'True (also featured in the 2000 film remake of 'Charlie'sAngels') and Middle East's 'Blood' that played into the closingcredits. As for the story, I liked how the subplots of certaincharacters were revealed such as Bernie turning out to be Jessica'sfather and Hannah being revealed to be Cal and Emily's eldest daughter.The cast includes some well-known stars such as Steve Carell (Cal),Julianne Moore (Emily), Ryan Gosling (Jacob), Zathura's Jonah Bobo(Robbie) and the face of the EE mobile network Kevin Bacon as Emily'swork colleague David.All in all this film has some enjoyable, engaging and memorable momentsbut it also had some aspects that left me slightly dissatisfied. 7/10.
