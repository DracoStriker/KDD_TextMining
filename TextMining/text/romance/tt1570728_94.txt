First I want to say I do not know how I barely even heard of this moviewhen it came out. It has a who's who list of A-list actors/actressesand yet I don't remember it getting much press. Well onto how greatthis movie was. This is a Steve Carell vehicle but all the actors givereally wonderful performances, really small parts for some big actorsMarissa Tomei, and Kevin Bacon, but they do well with a little screentime. Julianne Moore is as wonderful as ever. And as my title indicatesRyan Gosling and Emma Stone really sizzle together. I watched the theirmovies in reverse but they were very good in this movie and GangsterSquad earlier this year. and kudos to the youngsters in the movie theywere well played and very believable.This movie was equally well written and directed. It moves along at anice pace, there is almost no moment in the movie that left me a littlebored or thinking of what I was going to have for dinner. There aremoments that will tug at your heart strings, and there are outrightlaugh out loud moments, plenty of both actually.Even if you don't like romantic comedies, watch this movie, it'sprobably the best of it's genre in years.
