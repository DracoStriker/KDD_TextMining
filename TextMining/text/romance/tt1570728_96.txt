Crazy, Stupid, Love is almost a brilliant film, but it misses the markso heavily on one of its main elements that is is dragged down into themud. To it credit it does the 'Com' bit fantastically, Steve Carellplays the awkward 40-something part brilliantly, as he does whenever heis cast in this role. He is a pleasure to watch and this movie would belost without him. Gosling is even pretty watchable, and at times funny,his character has little depth however, and the parts of the film thatare emotional or romantic he fails to put any real feeling into hischaracter. The films biggest flaw is its women, I am not one to shout the feministagenda from the rooftops but you get the feeling the Writers had acomplete contempt for the female sex. Moore sometimes emerges fromthese shackles and you start to emphasise with her character but mostlyshe is the cause of the breakup and has little on screen time with herfamily. Emma Stones character is simply awful, and her friend in thefilm played by Liza Lapira is downright sickening. If we take one thingaway from this film it is that if a woman is better looking than herpartner he better know it, and he better know that he is lucky to haveher. It is such a pathetic and shallow view of love an relationshipsand it jibes so sharply with the message this film thinks its trying tocommunicate that it not only taints the film but destroys it. As ifthis wasn't bas enough Stones character for the rest of the film goesfrom mish-mash-crazy to completely uninvolved, its a real shame.The film still has its laugh-out-loud moments, and some great writing,but it cant recover from its fatal flaws.
