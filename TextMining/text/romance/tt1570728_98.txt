Liked this movie a lot. Thought Ryan Gosling's chest was great and hissuave way of dressing was ace. I loved the Dirty Dancing scene withEmma Stone and the banter when they first met. My main beef is aboutthe little boy Robbie: I assume he is meant to be portrayed as cute andwinning because he doesn't give up on true love but really he is aserial killer in waiting - completely creepy and a total stalker. Neverblinks, masturbating to her, telling her every five seconds. In reallife the girl should be disgusted and freaked out - especially givenher age. The movie just lost it for me when Jessica (the prettyteenager who is the object of little Robbie's unceasing desire) gavethe little creep naked photos of herself. It's meant to be touching andkind I guess but it's not - it's just wrong. Anyway, moving on... themovie is excellent - there is lots of humour and pathos. Emma Stone isexcellent in everything she does. Steve Carell was amusing and engagingand sympathetic. Another qualm is that there was nothing thatinteresting about Julianne Moore's character. The movie didn't exploreher midlife crisis if that's what it was. It was pretty shallow - itseemed like she decided not to go for Kevin Bacon because he lovedsushi and she didn't (or words to that effect). She seemed like anobject between the two guys rather than a real woman. It's not afeminist movie by any means - at one point Steve Carell's charactersays to Kevin Bacon's "She's all yours" and I would have loved forJulianne Moore to tell them she was nobody's. Anyway, a fun and wellmade, fairly clever movie - with flaws - and not so lovable ones.
