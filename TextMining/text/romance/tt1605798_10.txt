Holds your interest as a visually correct period drama casting severalveterans of many among them Emma Thompson, Greg Wise, Derek Jacobi,Julie Walters and Claudia Cardinale. The story on the surface hasmerit. An impotent man marries beneath his station a young bride hetraps in a gloomy gilded cage. Once several good samaritans separatelybelieve they can help her adjust without losing everything she schemesa path which will make her a rebel Victorian society. She historicallychallenge her husband's exalted place in the community herself againchanging locale and socioeconomics hoping for a better life. Anenticing true story not in my opinion well scripted by Emma Thompsonwhich seems the reason the general audience and critical reaction isnot higher.
