I was looking forward to this film having heard a play on radio aboutRuskin and Effie, but didn't know the full story.Unfortunately the opening scenes weren't promising, with some woodenacting from the actress playing Effie (why not cast a British actress?A stilted false accent obviously affected her performance) Also. theactor playing Ruskin has one expression and one tone of voicethroughout the film.It doesn't get much better and carries on slowly, dull and boring withslow, boring performances from most of the cast (with the exception ofDavid Suchet).There are a few things unexplained: what was the medicine Ruskin'smother gave Effie that made her sleepy/ ill? And why did she give it?Why did Ruskin senior say to Ruskin, we warned you about that girl yetyou married her? Why did the Ruskins seem unhappy at the Eastlakesvisit?It actually picks up towards the very end (yes, I kept watching) whenEffie confides in Lady Eastlake (a very orange and tanned Ms Thompson -completely wrong look for the time). And things finally move on. Thisis about 15 minutes before the end. The story should have started hereand continued with her next marriage. Apparently the film had a huge budget (spent on what?) and recouped amere fraction. I'm not surprised. The poor acting and script lets itdown. A poor example of British film making.
