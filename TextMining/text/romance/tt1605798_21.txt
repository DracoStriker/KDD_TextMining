The movie is superbly well-acted even while taking a look back at adark period in history when women's rights were essentiallynon-existent. Dakota Fanning turns in a brilliant performance, takingher character from a dewy-eyed young maid from the country to aresolute young woman bent on self-preservation and determined toembrace life. The only thing missing is "the rest of the story." Didshe find love? Did she have children? Was she able to finally enjoylife? Was she able to use her brain? A sequel is absolutely in order.From historical facts, we know some of the answers, but it would beever so lovely to experience the brighter side of Effie Gray's life onthe big screen.
