Great Masterpiece Theatre costumes, characters, and setting, but thewhole this is a slow motion bore.It's obvious from almost the beginning that the domineering parentsdon't like Effie. Nothing new about this plot -- been there and donethat. Then we learn that something is clearly wrong with Ruskin, themama's boy, who won't have sex with his wife.This story line goes on for an hour or so, and then we are introducedto a painter who captures Effie's heart -- now it's another version ofthe Forsyte Saga -- but we don't actually see any love scene.Then Effie finally goes to the lawyer and finds out she can get anannulment, and the movie essentially ends with the lawyer serving thedivorce papers.We looked this up in Wikipedia. The story as presented in the movie isessentially true and accurate, but the "real" story goes on to a publicscandal over this divorce with the re-marriage to the painter.The summary on IMDb indicates this will be about this "scandalous" lovetriangle. We learn for the first hour about two sides of the triangle,and we meet the third side in the second hour, but nothing about thescandal. This could have been a great movie with lawyers fighting incourt, newspapers chasing Ruskin, etc. Instead, Emman Thompson simplywrote a screenplay that strips this historic episode of any dramaticinterest.In the small art theater where we saw this, my wife and I were the onlyones in the audience. The projectionist was just about ready to lockthe door and go home. After see this move, we understand why.
