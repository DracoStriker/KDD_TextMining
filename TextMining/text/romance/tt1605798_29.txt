loved the movie, but Emma Thompson would be the best to play HillaryClinton in a movie called {Hillary}!can someone put this together, ordo you need me to write the plot! come on, think about it, at this timeit would be a box office hit! If you need any ideas, I can help you outwith this, although this movie (Effie Gray), Emma Thompson gave a veryhigh performance. But she wood give justice playing the first lady ofthe United States of America, Hillary Clinton. her grace and undeniableresemblance of Hillary Clinton would make the box office hits go offthe charts. There has to be someone out there that shares my thoughtsand imagination of how this would be a good story about our nationsfirst lady and the life of the Clintons.
