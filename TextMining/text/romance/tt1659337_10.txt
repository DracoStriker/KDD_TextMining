Although most reviewers on IMDb seem to be ecstatic about 'The Perks ofBeing a Wallflower', I don't think this film really stands out. To behonest, it didn't really move or impress me in any way. In my opinionit's a decent film, with some flaws, that could have been far better ifit wasn't so mainstream. I think most of the enthusiastic reviewers are young people, whorecognize themselves in this story about teenagers who choose to bedifferent from the rest. It's a very romantic story: a melancholicteenager befriends a group of progressive/bohemian/intellectualyoungsters, who differentiate themselves from the rest of the school.They introduce him to parties, drugs and music from The Smiths andDavid Bowie. He falls in love with one of the girls, and another girlfalls in love with him. There are secrets to keep, memories to shareand experiences to cherish. This could have been the cinematographic equal to Donna Tartt's novel'The Secret History'. But it lacks the dark, mysterious, Gothic aspectsof the book. There are traumas and secrets in 'The Perks of Being aWallflower', but they are implied and not clearly explained. It's clear this movie appeals to young people, who perhaps canrecognize a lot about their own life in the film. But to be a goodmovie in its own right, it should also be attractive for viewers inother age groups. I think in that respect this movie fails.
