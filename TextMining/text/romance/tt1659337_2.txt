Stephen Chbosky has taken his exceptional novel and made it anextraordinary film. As the opening credit rolled I was impressed withthe quality of the cast including Emma Watson, Paul Rudd, Kate Walsh,and Dylan McDermott. And to top it off, Joan Cusak is there as well.This is a story of coming of age and coming to terms of a boy enteringhigh school and adulthood. Freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) almost byaccident becomes friends with Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his stepsisterSam (Emma Watson). Soon he is hanging out learning about the ins andouts of being a teen. But there is something that is left unsaid, is itabout his last best friend or his aunt.Chbosky must have been blessed by John Hughes. Not only capturing thistimeless story with every word and sight, the film's soundtrack blowsme away. Not many can take a book of such depth and keep the heart andsoul of it alive, but it happened here. Go to the theatre and see it.Check out the book and read it. But most of all, Stay Infinite!
