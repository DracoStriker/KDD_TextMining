I didn't expect much when I picked The perks of being a wallflower towatch. Casting was unknown for me except for adorable Emma Watson, whoreally makes a really good performance in the movie. For me the movie really reminded me of my high school years. First Ithought that the movie was about a bullied kid and how he survives theAmerican high school, but I was happily surprised how deep the moviereally is. Its themes on sexuality, sex, social diversity and mentalsubjects gave me a real pleasure watching it. I could really see myselfas Charlie bullying aside. This flick is an awesome, realistic, view onones life. The movie sets on a short period, only one semester, but itreally captures the viewers heart and focus. It was kind of a deepdrama but I didn't feel sad during it, actually it made me kind ofhappy. It was nice to think back to my own high school years and myfirst love. I think many people can really identify themselves with themovie.In conclusion the movie is a brilliant classical movie, the main pointis the story and how it's shown. It was like being in a theater, actingwas mesmerizing and the story is just superb. Also remember to checkout Crowded House's Don't dream it's over after the movie, just somebrilliant music from the movie.
