The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a movie adapted from the epistolarynovel written by Stephen Chbosky about Charlie played by Logan Lerman,a teenager who lives his freshman year of high school. He has to copewith struggles such as the suicide of his best friend, his differencecompared to the others teenagers, problems with his family,... Duringthe year, Charlie will get closer to Sam and her step-brother, Patrickplayed by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. During the movie, you learn moreabout Charlie's life and that he has to cope with more than high schoolproblems. This story shows many teenagers' issues.I think that manyteenagers could relate to it. I really recommend this movie or even thebook, because it is a very moving story.
