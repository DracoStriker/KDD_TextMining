well, I've been hearing about this movie since it was out and i saw thetrailer and thought it was OK, nice cast(Logan lerman and EmmaWatson)but i wasn't that fascinated and one day i was checking the best20 movies of 2012 and it was in there so i said what the hick am goingto see it so i did and thank god in heavens for that because this indieweird flick is one of my favorite 10 movies of all times and rightclose to the top, it's deep, honest, sweetly romantic, surprising( thestory and performances) crazy, fun, hopeful, mind opening , and thelist will never end. maybe you'll say am being too emotional and you'rright because it touched me on a personal level because i know how itfeels to be trapped in a dark past and how we try to break free bylooking for some place or someone to belong to i cried at the endbecause i remembered how i got here, but for anyone else this movie isgoing to mesmerize you for many reasons: 1) Logan and Emma's chemistryis breath-taking, Ezra miller is such a complicated funny honest deepcharacter, and Logan lerman is so matured and darn sexy, if you hatedEmma in harry potter like i did you'l completely forget that she's evenBritish or that you'v seen her before she's mind blowing, also thecolors of the movie are very warm and they just make you feelcomfortable
