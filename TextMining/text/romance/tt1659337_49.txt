Every once in awhile a movie comes along that completely surprises you.After sifting through all the major blockbusters that come out everyyear there is always a movie like "Perks of Being a Wallflower",written and directed by Pittsburgh's own Stephen Chbosky, thatsurpasses everyone's expectations and ends up being one of the bestfilms of the year, despite being an independent film. "Perks" does somany things right. Chbosky assembled a cast and then knocked this thingout of the park. He does something big blockbuster so often don't do,he makes you characters that genuinely care about which makes the filmas powerful as any other you will see this year. I highly recommend"Perks", if for no other reason than that it's by far one of the mostheartfelt and original films you will see this year.
