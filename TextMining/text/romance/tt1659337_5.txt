I absolutely loved this film - specifically the acting, music and evenat times the cinematography. Steven Chbosky captured the spirit of thebook and the characters magnificently - Ezra and Logan give exceptionalperformances that deserve major credit. Emma gives a strong performanceas Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character,however she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry- she's in Bling Ring next year and will have improved by then, shedoes a great job of finding her ground and portraying a troubled yetlovable and wonderful teen, at times her actions speak much louder thanher words. Logan is phenomenal at every aspect of Charlie - awkward,unsure, emotional, honest - he gives an amazing performance. Ezra ishilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a moment'snotice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances from MaeWhitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is truly theheart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of humour,emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellentsoundtrack to back it up.
