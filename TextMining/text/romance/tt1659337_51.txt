Bad acting and a script that lacks any credibility. A high schoolfreshman mixing to this degree with a group of seniors? An outwardlygay student not getting any abuse, especially in the era the filmdepicts? Charlie wearing a tie so often? Wine always available to thesekids at their parties? Charlie the only one eating the hash brownie andtaking the hit of acid? How could the fight scene go on so long in theschool cafeteria without any teacher/monitor ever present? Even withthe built-up rage Charlie had inside, how could this scrawny kid stopthe gang beating underway? These are a few of my many questions for thefilm makers and those who wrote all the positive reviews of this veryweak film.
