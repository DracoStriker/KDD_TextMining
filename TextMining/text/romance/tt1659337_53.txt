The movie is written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, the very sameperson who wrote the amazing book of which the film is an adaptationof. It's a unique situation, given that it's entirely his vision andartistic integrity no matter how many changes there are between the twomediums. Not that there's anything to complain about between the two;the movie surprised me in just how heartfelt and genuine it came acrossand while it (of course) wasn't as powerful as the book, it still endedup being the most earnest and emotional coming of age film I have everseen.The beauty of it all is in just how well it captures the human state ofbecoming 'someone', no matter what we think we should be or what we'reafraid of. In this case, it's more about what we're afraid of peoplelearning about ourselves. In this case, our characters come from verydark, abused and broken places and somehow it manages to inspire andgive hope to the audience.While this is not a movie for the faint of heart, nor is it for thegeneral 'popcorn crowd', it is absolutely a quintessential filmexperience that should be shared by those who want to grow, learn, andmost importantly, understand others. The film does a phenomenal job of capturing the positive and lifedefining influences of friends, literature, music and love. The castcould not have been better, although, I do feel like Emma Watsondropped the ball on having the inner turmoil that her characterrequired. Something that may have been done better by someone with moreacting experience but nevertheless I have no real complaints at all.The small roles by Paul Rudd, Tom Savini, Nicholas Braun, and JoanCusack brought a tremendous amount of weight to the film; all wereexquisite. Don't be afraid of anything!Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this quick read. Then see thefilm. You'll thank me later.
