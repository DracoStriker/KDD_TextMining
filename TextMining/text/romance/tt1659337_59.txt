You will hate this movie. There's no question about it. You will hateit because you will find it stupid and/or boring... or you will hate itbecause you relate to it so much. In the case of the second one, thehatred will be caused by the disconnection from reality as real life israrely this perfect for an introvert. If you're neither, then I find not point for you watching this. It'swell made and rather well acted, however relating to this, adds so damnmuch that regular watching might just seem stupid. I've watched it a couple of times and it's true on all levels... eventhe awkwardness. No complains from me, but then again, I am a lightcritic.I have to give this movie one thing for sure... it does capture themind quite perfectly. Our mind is the biggest source of our troublesand this movie shows it quite nicely.
