Saw this movie at TIFF and after watching the trailer was thinking Iwas going to enjoy this movie. Those expectations now are so very low,this movie is amazing. It speaks on many different levels of being ateenager, dealing with death, loneliness, and how awkward it can betrying to fit in. I haven't seen a move like this in a very long timeand was very refreshing. The highlight of the film for me at least froma acting stand point is Ezra Miller really funny, but very heartfelt atthe same time. Don't get me wrong the whole case is amazing (EmmaWatson was perfect for this after HP) but Ezra really stands out.Stephen Chbosky really cared about this book, and it really shows inthis film. Him Directing and writing his own book was a amazing idea. It's going to get many comparisons to a John Hughes film, andrightfully so this movie is heart felt and just amazing. I will definitely being seeing this film again.
