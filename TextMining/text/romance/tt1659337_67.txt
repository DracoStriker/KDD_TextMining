I think it is one of the bests.I saw this movie because I like LoganLerman a lot.But I don't know why all his films should have a bad endand I should cry every time |: . If i want to recommend a movie to agirl actually I recommend this. Bur if I want recommend to a boy I willshow him Fury. It is as nice as this of course. Emma Watson was goodtoo but better than Mr.Lerman But there is some mistakes.In theater wecan see some Ideas that advertises Sexual promiscuity.Or having freedomin everything. It cant be true and I disagree.But I learned a lot oflessons of this movie.Being happy...showing my feeling without fear oranything else.Thank you to read
