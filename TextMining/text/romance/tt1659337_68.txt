Not your average coming-of-age teen movie!Stephen Chbosky's novel "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" marks mallsand search engine results even before it was released. The traileralone is already making a buzz in and around the media. Emma Watson'sface caught my attention at first glance on it aside from the applegreen background.Since it is an adaptation, I find it quite rare to hear good reviewsfrom people who have read the novel. It is about 15-year-old Charlie,an endearing and naive outsider, coping with first love Sam, thesuicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while strugglingto find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshmanis taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam and her step-brotherPatrick who welcome him to the real world ?new experiences, newfriends, music, and drugs.
