Directed by Stephen Chbosky, based on his own bestseller, "The Perks ofBeing a Wallflower" tells the story of a group of young "Wallflowers" aterm for people extremely introvert, shy, that avoids being part of orrather exclude themselves from most common social circles and thereforefeel a hard time making friends. In this film ,in particular, theorigin of these disorders is often of sexual nature, although this isnot the central aspect of the story. In the same line of "Dead PoetsSociety" (1989 ), this film reminds the adolescence and theunforgettable friends who pass through our lives and make us "feelinfinite." Almost like Remy's cooks in "Ratatouille" (2007 ), this filmarouses feelings and memories that are not always present, but aredeeply rooted in the depths of our souls. A love story, a story offears and insecurities, but most of all a self-discovery therapy.
