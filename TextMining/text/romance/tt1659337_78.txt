If John Hughes and Cameron Crowe had made a movie together it wouldprobably have been very similar to 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'.The older I get, the more these kinds of teenage melodramas grate on mynerves, but I was gob smacked by how emotionally invested I becamehere. The bulk of the credit goes to the cast (particularly the threeyoung leads; Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller), who at firstseem too poised and too pretty to play these broken characters, butonce the story begins to peel back the layers they really shine, andconsequently so does the movie.For teenagers this is required viewing. For adults your mileage mayvary.
