I avoided this at the movies as I - a) had not read the book, b)thought from the title it would about high school proms, mean girls anda Cinderella make-over. So here was The Perks of Being a Wallflower, onPayTv. A tale of three people in High School, with the main character,Charlie battling through a long hard back story.There I was at the endof this absorbing, beautiful film in gratitude for the combined talentsthat brought this to the screen.Where Stephen Chbosky and his team succeed is the refreshingpresumption that not everything has to be explained. Scenes move onquickly, words are spare.The audience has to think its way through -just as the characters need to do in their confusing corridors of life.Every character cast provides such a solid acting framework, whichmeant there was never a moment when the film loses its pace. Forexample, short scene psychiatrists are often portrayed by an anonymousname, stereo sympathy and a low key performance in a white coat. ButJoan Cusack's performance leaps out to allow the suffering Charlie ontoa hefty key point platform which keeps the film strong. Elegant actingand artistic direction bring us parents who let us imagine theirsuffering, rather than the usual high drama scenes of wringing handsand sobbing mothers.And Paul Rudd's performance as an English teachercould have fallen straight into an overdrawn caricature. Thankfully,like all the cast, he acts with refined restraint.This is a sophisticated film with incredible subtlety, that shows notall teenage films have to have shrieking, long haired blondes or dumbeddown story-lines. And by using actors who can really act, suspension ofdisbelief is easy. It also brings home that successful books, whichauthors have spent time and care in getting right, make the besttranslation to film when Hollywood doesn't decide to put a 'spin' onthem!
