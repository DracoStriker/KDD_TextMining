As I downloaded this film from iTunes, I didn't have great expectationsfor it but thought it would be a fun watch to pass some time. Afteronly a few minutes I was drawn in and immersed in a rich cast andstory.The movie not only follows the main character through his social life,but also through his thoughts as he struggles with a problematicchildhood memory which, for me, made the film. The flashbacks give anamazing view of the character and help to define his personality andmake him very human to the point I could relate very well.Through the highs and lows of the detailed times, the viewer is sweptthrough emotions with the character. I, personally, finished the filmon the verge of crying a mixture of tears of sadness and joy.The casting is absolutely perfect and I cannot imagine anyone better toplay the parts, which heavily supports the story and makes thecharacters more 'real'.This is a must watch film for everyone out there.
