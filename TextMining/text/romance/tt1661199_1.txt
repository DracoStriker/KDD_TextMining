This movie perfectly captures the feeling of reading a fairy tale, butinstead of that, you actually get to experience it by viewing it. I amso glad that they kept the Original story line, and the costumes andsetting are beautifully done. I have watched this movie multiple timesalready, and still feel like I could view it many times more.Definitely recommended for people that love classic fairy-tale stories.
