This tale of Cinderella is not only entertaining but a brilliant studyin jealously, insecurity, and being true to who you are. YoungCinderella is much loved by her parents and before her mother dies sheis given the advice "Have courage, and be kind". Cinderella takes theseto heart. After her father's sad death she is faced with fear andcruelty on a daily basis from her step-mother and stupid, spoileddaughters. How Cinderella deals with the irony of her situation incomparison to what her parents were like, is part of what makes thestory line so entertaining. The movie is beautifully shot, with greatcare taken with costumes, colors and overall theme to each image. Theactors play their roles with style (albeit Cinderella herself is a bitflat) and Kate Blanchet is restrained yet deeply malevolent in her roleas the step-mother. Cool beauty with ice in her veins, a true Disneyvillain! How fun! The restrained approach to the personified animals inCinderella's world is true to Disney's idea of "probableimprobability". This is a movie that could be watched many times overand always be entertaining.
