An excellent version where every scene is a feast for the eyes, a storythat is a feast for the soul, great acting and a perfect Cinderella.The fantasy sequences seem real as do the characters. Most of all, themovie can be watched without worry of radical perversion and badinfluence to anyone regardless of age. No filth, bad language, ortypical Hollywood garbage. I can enjoy this one over and over...myfavorite realistic Disney movie.
