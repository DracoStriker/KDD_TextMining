The trailers for this movie made the Cinderella seem extremely annoyingand a really bad actress for the movie. However, the movie itself wasnot as bad. It is disappointing that it is just a remake of Cindrellawith no other twists, turns, or interesting ideas. I'm not sure why somuch money would be spent on a literal mimic of what's already beendone. It could have been so much more interesting with an actual changeof plot, etc. Also, the character choices were very bad, especially thefairy godmother. She was wearing disgusting, naked clothes that areinappropriate, the makeup wasn't even nice and soothing, but garrish.It's like they couldn't recreate them to look like the time they belongto, but instead, made them look like today's morons. Cinderella was anannoying character and the juvenile 'be kind, have courage' was alsoannoying, because it is not applicable in the world. This movie shouldhave been new and different. *6/10*
