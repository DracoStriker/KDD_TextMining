I don't know Why Walt Disney movies have become so dull and tasteless.The story of Cinderella is a great story,but the acting is simplyterrible and the movie is so boring.The story of "Cinderella" follows the fortunes of young Ella, whosemerchant father remarries following the tragic death of her mother.Keen to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmotherLady Tremaine and her daughters Anastasia and Drizella into the familyhome. But when Ella's father suddenly passes away, she finds herself atthe mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated tonothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefullyrenamed Cinderella since she works in the cinders, Ella could easilybegin to lose hope.Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined tohonor her mother's dying words to "have courage and be kind." She willnot give in to despair, nor despise those who abuse her. And then thereis the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he isreally the prince and not merely an employee at the palace, Ellafinally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears as if her fortunesmay be about to change when the palace sends out an open invitation forall maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once againencountering the charming "Kit." Alas, her stepmother forbids her toattend and callously rips apart her dress. But as in all good fairytales, help is at hand as a kindly beggar woman steps forward and,armed with a pumpkin and a few mice, changes Cinderella's life forever.Disney failed to make a masterpiece from this cliché.Most kidsincluding my children hated this film and found it boring anduninteresting.The story of Cinderella has been extremely overused.I don't know whyDisney insists on making a new modern version from this cliché!.Definitely Disney needs to make a lot of money. I advise you to avoidthis movie,but if you wanna see this movie,see it on your ownresponsibility!.
