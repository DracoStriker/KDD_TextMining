My daughters were so excited to see this one, what a completedisappointment!Even Kate Blanchet couldn't save it. The real problem was the script.Nothing new added to the original story, vague plot, and BORING! Theset and actual picture of it was magnificent, but sadly lost in themediocre acting and sappy sad story.I'd so much rather watch the original Disney cartoon. If you're lookingfor a Maleficent style re-do of the classic story then watch Ever Afterwith Drew Barrymore.Honestly, there were parts of this movie that made me cringe to thinkmy daughters were watching. Was Disney trying to redeem the story withthe be brave and kind line? At one point, Cinderella states thatspending one night with the prince would make memories to keep her warmfor the rest of her life. Really? And they couldn't find a dress thatwould hold her breasts? I kept thinking maybe the target audience wasactually 13 year old boys!! I was so bored I wanted to get up andleave.Even my girls, who watched intently, left disappointed and saidafterward that it was "okay." Now that's an honest review of thismovie! Disney sure disappointed with this one.
