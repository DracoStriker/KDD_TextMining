Cinderella is the worst movie and a cliché remake by Walt DisneyStudios.Are Walt Disney so desperate to rip off and copy all Cinderella moviescenes and to make a very bad copy.I saw the previous Cinderella movies (especially the originalCinderella movie) they were too much better and well done than thisstolen and pirated copy movie.Why would the producers of Walt Disney Studios make a very boring filmwhich even kids might hate because of the absence of creativity.To be honest and to tell the truth: I regret seeing this film becauseit is only made for babies to fool them.Avoid this movie and watch the original first copy because it issuperior,while this pirated and rip off movie is so inferior if not theworst movie ever made.
