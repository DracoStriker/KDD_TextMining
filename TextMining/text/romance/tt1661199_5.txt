My disappointment was hearing that critics had found fault with thiswork of perfection.The characterisation has been thought through carefully and thetemptation to make caricatures of the step-mother and her daughtersconsciously resisted.The retelling of "Cinderella" (apparently known, in the 19th century,as "Cinderslut") with the benefits of modern techniques and processesis impeccable.Often, films that are 'great works' suffer from some minor weakness orother, a detail not followed through, a hasty bit of editing, a clippedor overly long scene but never did I feel that could be said aboutDisney's film. "TLC" (tender loving care") from beginning to end.True to Walt's original intentions, here is a film for all the family(well, some teenagers may want to wait a little).Good luck, it's great to see memorable films making it to our screens.
