I was expecting more from this movie. The acting is average, and thedirector could have chosen a prettier Cinderella, she looks like anaverage girl next door in this movie, but then her waist becomesunrealistically thin as she goes to the ball. What standards are theysetting with this movie for young girls? Her stepsisters, on the otherhand, are looking too ugly that it is almost funny. Another thing which annoyed me about this movie is that the evilstepmother had a cat, although there were no cats in the actualCinderella fairy tale! Apparently the director doesn't like cats andrepresents them as evil creatures in this movie. I got terribly annoyedthat such as impression is being created about these beautiful, lovelyanimals. Such movies might be the cause for cruelty towards cats too. Overall, I didn't like the movie. It was an attempt to create abeautiful story out of a beautiful fairy tale, which failed because ofmediocre acting and numerous stupid annoying details. Shame on thedirector!
