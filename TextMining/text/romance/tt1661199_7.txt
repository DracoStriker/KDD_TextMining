This movie is just magical! The message of the movie genuinely touchedmy heart and spirit, it was breathtakingly gorgeous! The colors, thecinematography, the costumes just wow and love the music! The onlything i would change is i would love it more if there's singing..LilyJames have a very sweet mezzo soprano voice i love her singing "A Dreamis a Wish" at the end of the movie. And yes The acting was so good icried like so many times..my fave was Prince Kit and the King'sscene,Lily crying when her dress was ripped and the first dance oh godit was magic! and the gown transformation was so epic! The lead actorschemistry is so strong.. i fell in love with them. This movie is souplifting makes me do kind deeds every time! People saying it wasboring have a heart of stone for real. This is Amazing and i can't waitfor Beauty and The Beast.. Well done Disney!???
