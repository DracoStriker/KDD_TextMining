Since Cinderella is a famous story, everyone knows the plot of it sopeople know what to expect, except... they don't because it was a bitdifferent in the movie.The first time I watched the movie, I thought it was really goodbecause I was really excited to watch one of my favorite Disney'sprincess movie be remade into a movie with real live characters. SinceI thought the movie was pretty good, I decided to watch it again. Whilewatching it the second time I realized that the movie wasn't even thatgood. I noticed that the acting was quite cheesy and fake(?). I alsofelt like Ella (Cinderella) was only kind to everyone because hermother told her to. The "we must have courage and be kind" is said toomany times and i find it annoying.Although, there were also some really good parts which were when shemet the prince, when the fairy-god mother changed her old, ripped dressinto a beautiful and magical looking dress, and when she arrived to theball and everyone looked at her. But I would still say it was quitecheesy. That's the main thing I don't like about the movie. It doesn'tmean you shouldn't watch it tho.
