Cinderella is a live-action reimagining of the Disney animated movie.The plot is the same; don't go in expecting anything subversive,hilarious or unique because that's not what this is. All this reallydoes is translate the story to live action. Still, what's wrong withthat? To my enormous surprise, I found Cinderella to be really charmingand rather enjoyable. It's very simple and safe, and follows the Disneyformula rigidly. But as a traditional adaptation of the fairy tale, itworks. Lily James is endlessly likable in the title role and whileCinderella is a somewhat two-dimensional figure, she manages to givethe character personality. Richard Madden as the Prince is similarlylimited by a bland character arc, but does fine in the role. Thestandout is Cate Blanchett as the evil Stepmother, who fills thepantomime villain role wonderfully. Helena Bonham Carter also does agood job as the Fairy Godmother. Kenneth Branagh directs the film welland visually the film is pretty stunning. It's overblown in the bestsense of the word, with its dazzling cinematography, brilliantmise-en-scene and vibrant colour palette making it a slightly magicalvisual treat. While it doesn't take any risks aside from an unexpectedand touching scene between the Prince and his father, this update ofCinderella is very likable and is genuinely charming. While this isn'tmy kind of movie, I genuinely had a nice time watching it. If you'rebored of the Disney formula this won't change your mind, but the targetaudience will absolutely adore it.7/10
