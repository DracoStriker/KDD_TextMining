I absolutely loved this movie! It is pure Disney fairytale magic.I wasn't a fan of the previous Disney live-action remake Malificent. Ithought Malificent did a disservice to the original story of sleepingbeauty, changing so much but replacing it with a story that wasn't asgood as the original.This movie stuck very close to the original Disney animated story,making it an instant classic. However they changed the story justenough to make it more relatable and believable for an audience today.I was amazed at how the very small changes impacted the story and howyou view the characters. It makes the characters actions moreunderstandable and gives them more backstory. I actually thought therewas a lot of character development for a straightforward fairytale.This film was very romantic story-wise and visually, with elaboratedresses and sets. It all feels very classical and theatrical.Lily James was great as Cinderella. It is good that they cast arelatively unknown actress, this way you don't get distracted from thecharacter by a familiar face. Cate Blanchett has the role of evilstepmother down, even giving her a relatable side, without making heless threatening. Richard madden is cast as the prince. I love thatthey gave him much more character and backstory than in the animatedversion. The relationship with his father was very touching and gavehim a vulnerable side, making him much more interesting. Richard Maddenalso has the undeniable royal good looks, making him a perfect fit forthe role as charming prince.I enjoyed this movie immensely. Its timeless and fairytale-esque with agreat deal of Disney magic. Any Disney fan will love this and it makesme excited for more live-action Disney classic remakes.
