It's a good movie because when I watched it,I was so happy . It showsus about happy family, how much our family loves us. How much we hurtif our family gone away from us. Born to be a good person, have courageand be kind. I laugh , smile and cry when I watch that movie . After Iwatched that movie I have learn to be Kind , learn to forgive someonewhen they got a mistake and be nice to them and give them a chance tocorrect. One more thing is a mother,sometimes a step mother is not thebest mother like our biological mother, this is a sad thing in thatmovie. And the happy thing is when Cinderella and the prince are inlove each other and then get a married and get the happiness. So I wantguys to watch this movie because It is a great movie I've ever seen, mytears dropped and sometimes you'll be happy also. I hope guys enjoy it,that's so great and amazing.
