I wanted to watch Les Miserables in a movie theater but somehow I didnot manage to do it on time, so I bought the DVD.... Sorry for themoney.I do not know if my expectations are too high (being myself a musician)but I sort of think that what a musical is all about is singing. Actingis important, costumes can be nice and it does not hurt if the takesare nice too. However, hence the word MUSICal, it's all about music,and Les Miserables are simply miserable in this respect. The main twoactors (Jackman and Craw) are undoubtedly very good actors but have noidea how to sing; They are incapable of singing a straight note and itis obvious that they never had any real lessons except probably atacting school (as usual with these cases a month's coaching before theshooting is not enough - all professional e.g. Broadway singers whosuffer for years are not stupid, they do it for a reason). Had they notbeen famous, everyone would laugh.Whoever does not believe me simply please buy the CD with some propercast (for instance Michael Ball or Anthony Warlow).If one can tolerate the insufferable singing, I admit that the rest isexcellent. The acting is superb, the takes breathtaking, the costumesand sets fantastic, and the emotions overwhelming. If....I take away five stars for the awful music and give full credit to therest. However, music is in my opinion half the job, and in this casehalf a job very badly done.
