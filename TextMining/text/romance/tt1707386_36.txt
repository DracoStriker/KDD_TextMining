After seeing the stage play several times I was apprehensive that thefilm would live up to the spectacle of the stage version. Not at alldisappointed.You are gripped by the story line and characters from the offset, andquickly tune into the emotion of the lyrics and music.Putting a musical into a film was a risk, but it paid off because thestory is the music. The sets are vast but simplistic, relating to thestage play.Hugh Jackman played a blinding role, as did Anne Hathaway and AmandaSiegfried. Russell Crowe played a great 'baddie' but his signing wasn'treally the highlight of his role.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were both excellent for theroles they played of the innkeeper and his wife, the lightness in thedarkness of the film, very funny.Without giving away and spoilers, its difficult to describe how trulyemotionally charged the film is, but as soon as the haunting music andchilling lyrics start, you do get a rush of pure sadness in places. Somoving.You know a film is good when the cinema audience give a round ofapplause at the end, and they did.A must see film, at the cinema, for the pure spectacle and sound track.
