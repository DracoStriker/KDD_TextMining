This is the first time that I have actually seen this story and to putit bluntly, it simply blew my mind, right to the point that as I amwriting this I am listening to the songs on You-Tube. The one thingthat unfortunately drags this particular movie down (and pretty mucheverything else about this film is absolutely spectacular) is SachaBaron Cohen. Every scene in which he was in was painful (and maybe thatis still a hangover from Borat) and as far as I am concerned, hecompletely butchered 'Master of the House' (though it was redeemed with'oohh Santa!', if you have seen the film you will know what I mean).Basically the story is about grace and how one man responds to grace.Many times I have heard pastors use this story to describe grace (andthey namely refer to the scene where the bishop responds to Valjean'stheft of the silverware with the statement that it was gift, and theonly problem was that he left too early because he forgot to take thecandle sticks). If it be only that scene that made this story stand outthen that would be enough, but it goes much further because the wholetheme of the story is about how Valjean responds to this act of gracein that he completely turns his life around and becomes a wellrespected citizen.Still, believe it or not, there is even more. This story is almostShakespearian in scope in that there are at least three or four plotsintermeshed into the story (with the main plot being the redemption ofValjean). For instance, we have a love story, a story of selfsacrifice, an exploration of the life of the peasant in early 19thcentury France, a failed revolution, and of course, the dogged pursuitof Valjean by his nemesis Javert.I remember making a comment about Cohen on a facebook entry and afriend of mine responded by making a snide comment about Russell Crowesinging, and maybe that tarnished the film a bit, but after seeing it,I don't think Crowe did a bad job at all, and if fact I think he tookup the challenge and succeeded with flying colours. In fact, by the endof the movie I had no problem with Russell Crowe playing a major roleat all. As for Hugh 'Wolverine show us your claws' Jackman, well, weall know that he can sing and that he has starred in musicalspreviously, and as the main character, he was absolutely superb.
