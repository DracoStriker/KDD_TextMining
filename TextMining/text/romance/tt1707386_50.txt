In my opinion,Les Miserables is a lot like Harry Potter and the DeathlyHallows Part 2. Both didn't live up to my full hype but I could see whythere was such a hype. Les Miserables is a big movie adapted from a bigmusical adapted from a big book and it shows. Granted,it's not the bestfilm that I have ever seen but it's definitely going to stick in mymind.The scale of it was amazing, the songs were really good,if not abit tedious after a while and the casting was pretty much perfect. Somehighlights include Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche, Samantha Barks asEponine and Sacha Baren Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as theThenadiers. The Thenadiers make this movie, I don't think I havelaughed that much at a movie in a long time and I would happily pay theprice of admission and watch it again just to see them. As for theflaws that everyone else has complained of,they didn't bother me. Theangles weren't that distracting and Russell Crowe actually has a decentsinging voice on him, compared to the others in the cast,it does soundout of place but if he was in something like Jesus ChristSuperstar,then it would sound a lot better. Overall, Les Miserables isa musical unlike the usual type and is definitely worth a watch.
