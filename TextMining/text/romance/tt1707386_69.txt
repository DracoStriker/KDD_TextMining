Don't get me wrong: I do like musicals. But I only like musicals thathave real music in them with songs that have something to do them.Musicals I do like for example are The Sound of Music, Oklahoma andWest Side Story. They all have something this movie didn't - goodsongs. In this movie, the music was so terrible it ruined the movie. Itwould have been a half way decent movie if they eliminated the songsaltogether and the actors just delivered their dialog without thesinging the dialog to what I can only describe as droning the words.The lesson is this: If you don't have good songs and people like Rogersand Hammerstein with the wonderful ability to write good songs, don'teven try to make a musical. I turned it off after a half hour. VictorHugo's Les Miserables is a wonderful story. Too bad they chose to ruinit.
