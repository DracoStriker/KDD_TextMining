If you persevere through the opening act, you will be amply rewardedfor your patience. True, Crowe's singing does not match those aroundhim but the other performances are good enough that his miscasting doesnot stay with you for too long.Tom Hooper's use of close-ups gives you an intimacy that would neverhave been possible on stage. Anne Hathaway is a revelation. She hasperformed the definitive "I dream a dream" and has set the standard towhich all others will now be judged. No matter how many times I listento her rendition, I always feel a lump in my throat. Despite the shorttime that she is on, she steals the scenes that she's in and trulydeserves an Oscar for best supporting actress role.Hugh Jackman is superb and fits the role of Jean Valjean perfectly. Intruth, excellent performances abound - Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks -to name but a few.If there is only one film that you would see this year and even if youdon't enjoy musicals, I would say that this is the one that you shouldsee - no question.
