This film is so far out of my comfort zone it is scary. This is not thekind of film I would normally watch. Thank God I went to see it, I havenever been so moved by a film in my life, I sat crying my eyes out bythe end, washed away with emotion, from the despair to the joy andeverything in-between. The direction of the film, the effects, thesinging, the acting, the lighting, you name it everything came togetherin a perfect storm and created a truly wonderful film. I've been to seeit twice and both times it moved me so much it's ridiculous.If you go to see the film take some tissues for the tears, if you goand you're not moved then I pray for your soul, because this film wouldmove immovable objects to tears or cause unstoppable objects to deflectfrom their path.I can't recommend this film enough, it's a true masterpiece ofcinematic art.
