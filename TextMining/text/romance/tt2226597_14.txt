Despite hardly knowingeach other but they form a bond despite differences. As they bond witha dog also on board While with injuries with Ben helping himself andAlex in the patching them upBut with little food, hardly any rest, and fearing they may not makeit. Both discover each other and themselves in ways that they nevercould have.Kate Winslet and Idris Elba in the lead roles do well and they are inthe only two that are in the film for about 90% of the time. They dowell with the elements against them and handle it with both grace andbeing gutsy.Great film ans really it is a struggle to survive.
