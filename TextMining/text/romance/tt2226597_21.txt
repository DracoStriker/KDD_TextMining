I think the best thing this film has going for it is casting Idris Elbaand Kate Winslet. Its a pairing you didn't really expect, yet most ofthe intrigue comes from seeing how they are together in a film. I don'tmind a survival film, if done right it can be hearth-wrenching andwildly fun. I can't really say this film delivers on that front andkind of gets lost in the sap that the film chooses to focus on. Becauseof that the interest in the film wanes as it goes by.The film is about two people who desperately need to get back to Denverbut find out their flight is cancelled. They decide to hire a privatejet, which eventually crashed into a mountain. The two leads are leftstranded in the cold with a dog, limited food, injuries, and the harshcold weather. They must attempt to survive, while learning about eachother along the way and forming a connection.If this film was more oriented on the thrills that a tale of survivalbring, then I feel like this film would have been way worth the watch.Its mostly about two people falling in love when they are strandedtogether. I'd say the last twenty minutes or so of the film really takestride in a full on romance tale and becomes something you would see ina Nicholas Sparks story. This really undermines how strong the filmcould have been.What we see is a story that didn't maximize its potential and fallsinto a really generic love story. This isn't really the fault of theleads who I thought both did quite well with the material they weregiven. I know people have complained about a lack of chemistry betweenthe stars but I didn't have a problem with this as much as a hamfistedlove story in a film that failed to create a strong sense of urgency.Its a forgettable effort, but some may enjoy what they see.6/10
