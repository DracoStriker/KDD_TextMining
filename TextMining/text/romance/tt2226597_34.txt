The Mountain Between Us is directed by Hany Abu-Assad. The movie isabout Dr Ben Bass, a neurosurgeon ( actor Idris Elba know him from myfavorite The Office TV show) and Alex Martin (Kate Winslet ), aphotographer both desperate to reach Denver, CO during bad weather.Both get on to a charter flight with pilot , a Vietnam war vet Walter (Beau Bridges)and Walter's dog. Because Walter gets a heart attack whileflying, plane crashes among beautiful snow covered mountains. The wholemovie is about how Ben, Alex and the dog survive the cold in middle ofnowhere. But after they reach land and are hospitalized, Alex and herfiancé Mark (Dermot Mulroney known for My Best Friend's wedding)reunite and Alex and Ben go separate ways. I like Kate Winslet again(did not like her in The Dressmaker). Not a dog lover but enjoyedseeing Walter's dog in this movie(after Marley and me, my favorite dogmovie). Nice cinematography especially after the plane crash. 1hr 52minutes. Not Oscar worthy. pleasant.
