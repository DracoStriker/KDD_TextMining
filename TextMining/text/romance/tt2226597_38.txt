No major spoilers, but marked it as such just in case.I thought this movie was fine as is. It's not groundbreaking cinema,but it isn't a heap of trash either. I think the movie was definitelydrawn out at parts and it seemed as if the cold atmosphere of the snowymountains laid the foundation for the at-times cold relationshipbetween our two only characters.I gave the movie an 8 because I feel that it did the best it could withwhat it had. Backstories could have been developed more strongly whichwould have made the audience feel the connection between the two moreefficiently. I felt that Idris Elba has yet again solidified himself asone of the most underrated gentlemen actors of our age. Someone needsto give this man a career defining role. Other than that, you have two acting juggernauts who are prancingaround a snowy mountainside just as delicately as they prance around anotherwise cold and unengaging script. In movies like this, dialogue iseverything, and sadly, it felt lacking at times. There was anopportunity to give off Richard Linklater emotions with the movie andit just feel a bit flat.Nothing to rush to your theater for, but not a waste of time.8/10
