When I left the cinema after enduring this film my thoughts immediatelyturned to IMDb and what kind of response it would have had on thissite.I imagined that (like myself) there would be floods of complaints aboutthe wooden acting, the ease at which the main characters just saunteredthrough their 'ordeal' as though they were just nipping to the shopsfor a pint and a dozen eggs, and thought that it would be universallyhated.I read one review today that said this was the worst movie they'd seenin the last thirty years.Well I sat through Dads Army, I just about managed to stay awake duringthe Absolutely Fabulous movie but even those two flops were moreconvincing than this film.What is supposed to be a high drama survival movie is a bland, dull,uninspiring walk through the snow for an hour and half. Even themoments of peril are dealt with in as short a time as possible with nofear or risk involved whatsoever. The romance is unconvincing to me. Before anything happened between ourtwo lead characters I was thinking to myself that these guys clearlydidn't like each other at all during the filming of this movie. Therewas little to no chemistry, the acting was woeful (from two of moviesfinest actors supposedly) and it all just seemed tired and as if nobodyon the set wanted to be there.The story's climax isn't a climax at all. It's just a sudden give-up onwhat had come before.I have to agree with the chap who said they'd not seen worse in a longlong time. This was most definitely the weakest of all the movies I'veseen in years. My advice to anyone considering it is as always go andmake your own mind up. But don't say I didn't warn you.
