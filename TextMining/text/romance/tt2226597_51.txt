I saw "The Mountain Between Us", starring Idris Elba-The Dark Tower,Pacific Rim; Kate Winslet-Collateral beauty, Steve Jobs; Beau Bridges-Masters of Sex_tv, Max Payne and Dermot Mulroney-Pure Genius_tv, TheGrey. This is a plane crash/survival/romance movie. Idris is a doctorstranded at an airport and Kate is a photo journalist on her way hometo get married to Dermot-and she is also stranded at the airport. Theyjoin forces and decide to share the costs on a chartered plane flown byBeau but saving a few bucks ends up costing them more problems.Problems such as a plane crash in some snow covered mountains-andBeau's demise-so 2 total strangers have to depend on each other tosurvive. Oh yeah, Kate breaks her leg in the crash-Wow, it's a goodthing Idris is a doctor-so she really has to depend on the kindness ofstrangers. Of course, all this depending on each other leads to someromantic feelings-Hey, they might just die in all that snow and havingto fight off wild cougars and they may never make it back to theirloved ones-and some heavy thinking to do on both their parts. I guessit's alright for what it is, but it's not my cup of tea-I don't thinkmy wife even liked it that much. It's rated "PG-13" for peril, injuryimages, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of1 hour & 43 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but I guessit would be alright as a rental.
