Well I had plans to go see this movie with 2 friends and almost backedout after reading some of the reviews. Turned out all 3 of us enjoyedit without being disappointed. Really went to see it as there isn't awhole lot out of other great movies out there right at the moment, andtwice this year have went to see movies that aren't blockbuster typesand got a nice surprise-the other was "Wind River". I rated Wind Rivera 10 and this one an 8. I rated this an 8 more due to the action,story, and entertainment value. You kind of know in some cases wherethis movie was headed, but then at times it would give you a curve anda twist. Of course some of it was your typical plane wreck withsurvivors who have to form a plan and grit things out, fightingelements, wilderness, and using sheer determination to live. If yourlooking for a movie that delights on sheer entertainment value, then gosee it for what its worth as this movie delivers on the price ofadmission. Don't make the mistake I almost made, take a chance and gosee it.
