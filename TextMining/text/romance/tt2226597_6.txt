Some films have left me speechless. Not simply because their executionwas unlike anything I've seen in the past, or opened my eyes to a storyso insane thinking someone came up with this idea, but speechless causethere's so little to say about it as the film doesn't ask any new orinteresting questions. The Mountain Between Us is that kind of filmdespite having 2 very talented actors I respect in this romantic drama.The story begins with Idris Elba as a doctor rushing to Baltimore forsurgery and Kate Winslet off to get married to her fiancé and theyagree to work together to get to their destinations. However, theirplane crashes into the middle of the mountains and leaves them strandedwith only a golden retriever and their wits to find shelter and keepone another from falling apart.Kate and Idris both give committed performances even through the harshweather conditions displayed. The cinematographer sets up some prettybeautiful shots of the mountains and the scale and distance the actorsare from any form of civilization so that was something I appreciatedin a post "every month a CGI fest blockbuster" world. Sadly thecompliments end here.What kills the film is it's SO UTTERLY PREDICTABLE. If you have seenany romantic film ever, you know what will happen. The dialogue is voidof any psychological questions of dealing with a stranger alone forweeks despite the film feels like it's only 6 days tops. Not as viewerdid I feel they went through harsh conditions as Kate's hair the entiretime looked freshly curled.The Mountain Between Us on the trailer felt what could have been asolid survival film, but instead got a corny and sometimes boringromantic drama. Outside of one genuine jump scare that truly surprisedme, the film just feels lost in trying to be a romantic movie andsurvival movie at the same time with very little chemistry to weavethem together.
