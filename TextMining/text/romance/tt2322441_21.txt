I've never read the book and the marketing around the movie was so goodthat I had to see it. But the movie is so bad, it is not worth it. Theactors are really terrible and the dialogues couldn't even exist inreal life. You'll be siting for two hours to watch nothing happening inthe movie besides 2 minutes of sex scenes. I can say that I laughed thewhole time because it was ridiculous. The only good thing about themovie is the soundtrack which really matches the whole thing on thescreen.50 Shades of Grey is one of the worst movies I've seen and if yourgirlfriend asks you to take her to watch it, she doesn't love you.
