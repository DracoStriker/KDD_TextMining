I have to say right from the start that I read the entire first bookand that I thought it was absolutely horrible - badly written eroticaat best with a lame plot and a horribly pathetic female lead and a veryunlikeable hero (who was no hero to me).That out of the way, I saw Jamie Dornan was cast and heard they changeda lot of the story for the movie script and thought maybe it would beOK, but it wasn't.I counted 10 people who left at some part during the movie and nevercame back, which is rare these days as people tend to stay to get theirmoney's worth out of the price of the ticket.The settings are nice at times and so is the music, but the acting(Jamie what were you thinking????) was so wooden. It was almost like aSaturday Night Live skit, except they weren't playing for laughs inthis movie they were serious, but it was cringeworthy at best.Christian Grey is no hero, and Dakota Johnson was so understated it waslike she wasn't even there at all.Not a good movie - definitely not a date movie (I was so irritated byit by the time I left, no one was getting lucky!).The good parts of the movie - really the music is the best part and theend, because it was finally over - could have been a good 20 minutesshorter! The bad parts - the script was like a really bad 1960's Mills& Boon romance, and it was so slow you could honestly fall asleep ifthe acting weren't so painfully wooden.If you are looking for a good mainstream movie to watch to get turnedon, find one on Netflix, Google movies that are sexy, you'll findsomething much more titillating.I am so glad some of the actors who were originally considered decidedto say no, this movie could be a career killer! I hope it isn't thenumber 1 movie this week purely because it would be a shame if thisdrivel is what Americans actually want to watch and think is sexy. Menof course will enjoy the naked parts, of course they will, Dakota has anice body, but as a woman, I don't ever want to be as wussy asAnastasia and I sure don't want women in general thinking it's OK to beabused by a guy in the name of sex.Being tied up is great in a committed relationship, it's fun, it's NOTabusive - BUT in this movie, it's creepy, borderline degrading and justuncomfortable.The funniest part for me (apart from the script!) was how uncomfortablethe men who had clearly come in with their wives thinking they weregoing to get lucky later, and clearly wanted to leave and couldn't.Hilarious! I gave it a 1 out of 10 because you can't go any lower andthe music really was quite good, but everything else, give this one amiss and wait for the UV code to come out - at least you won't waste asmuch money as 2 movie tickets, drinks, popcorn etc, and there's an OFFbutton on the ROKU, so you can switch this crapola off and just go havesex with your partner instead.
