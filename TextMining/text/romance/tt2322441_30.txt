Please keep in mind, I have read the books. That's not to say I likedthem, I actually struggled to get through the poor writing ability ofthe author and the incessant use of the same adjectives over and overlike there wasn't a thesaurus handy. Now, I just returned from seeing this in the theater and I must saythat I wish I had waited until it was out on cable. I thought I'd givethem a chance to spruce up the books a bit, but that did not happen. Iwas bored after about 30 minutes into it and thought of leaving halfwaythrough. The acting was OK, but then again both stars worked with what they weregiven...which was not a lot of dialogue to start with. I wouldn't hangmy hat on either of them. The set design was good for the most part andstayed close to the books as far as colors and layout. Other than that,there's really not a lot of positive review for this. It felt like Iwas watching a bad soap opera.
