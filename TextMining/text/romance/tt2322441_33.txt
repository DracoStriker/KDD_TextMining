No this is not entertainment. The actors themselves where traumatizedafter doing this movie. You are watching real violence, a real youngwomen feeling really ashamed being humiliated not simply in a privateroom but in front of cameramen and film crew. Dakota Johnson herselfsaid in several interviews that she hopes that nobody ever watches themovie. "I don't want my family to see it, because it's inappropriate.Or my brother's friends that I grew up with. Also there's part of methat's like, I don't want anyone to see this movie.all the money the actors got doesn't make up for the fact that theyjust add to the plight of women world wide. In South Africa a girl israped every for minutes. The movie is sold out here. Now girls will beraped and tortured. Great. Thanks Hollywood.
