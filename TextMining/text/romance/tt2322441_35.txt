"Lifestyles of the Rich and Perverse" might be a more fitting title forthe unusually explicit bedroom drama.This adaptation of a trilogy of novels by E.L. James -- which featuresa modern-day Marquis de Sade as its male protagonist -- has apornographically narrow focus and a potentially dangerous message.James, whose real name is Erika Mitchell, has apparently captured theimaginations of bored housewives everywhere by tracing the unlikelyromance between socially awkward college student Anastasia andintimidating business tycoon Christian Grey.The popularity -- and notoriety -- of James' fiction is such thatmoviegoers know from the outset that the stumbling block tripping thesetwo up, as they attempt to tango, will be Christian's fondness forwhips and chains. Thus the duo's first interaction -- which comes aboutwhen Ana agrees to fill in for her ailing roommate Kate, a journalismmajor, by interviewing Christian for the campus newspaper -- is loadeddown with dramatic irony.All Ana knows is that Christian has been tapped to deliver thecommencement address at her pending graduation. But we're on to thisdungeon-loving Bruce Wayne's real identity. So his sly double entendresare ever so much fun.In between the zingers, Ana and Christian fall for each other. Yet, asAna tries to bond with her aloof new beau, she's perplexed by his totallack of hearts-and-flowers romanticism. Until, that is, she discoversthat he's an obsessive sadist with an elaborately equipped "playroom"full of pain-inducing gadgets and restraints.Though it's framed in the familiar context of a good girl's crusade toredeem a naughty boy, Ana's eventual cooperation with Christian'sperversion, risks conveying the idea that all women are potentiallywilling victims of physical abuse and humiliation. We're also left towonder what role Christian's helicopter and fancy penthouse pad play inrendering Ana so tractable.While responsible viewers might sympathize with Christian's troubledbackground, both in childhood and beyond, as well as with his passingacknowledgement of the harmful nature of his proclivities, the intentto stir audiences by teasing a supposed taboo is unmistakable.Sadly, but essentially (at the risk of repeating) this 'fantasy'promotes all the worst things (mostly violence) on the "person" (espwomen): ie: stalk, do harm (physically n psychologically), prostitute(money), pornography upon women .. and bring down the dignity of menanyway that's my piece... the movie is -10, but the chart doesn't havethat option :-)
