Everyone completely let down this movie. It deserves way more than whatpeople are giving it. I personally will be buying this movie when it isreleased. Mob psychology hit this movie real hard. Once a few peoplestarted dissing it, other people believed them and wouldn't judge itfor what it actually was. This kind of story will obviously not appealto everyone but it did for some so people need to stop ruining othersfun. Now, for the real review, I thought the actors were great. They hadtheir awkward phase together because they're starting a newrelationship and he has a big secret to tell. NOT because they'reawkward actors. Don't tell me that in real life that wouldn't be alittle awkward. They played their growing relationship parts perfectly.I actually felt like I could know these actors BECAUSE they acted sowell and made it seem like everyday life and not the glitz and glamacting of all the famous actors we've put on pedestals. The cinematography definitely worked for me. They made the movie comealive with the settings, lighting, and angles they used. The differentscenes in themselves helped tell the story in a way words couldn't. I LOVE the changes they made from the book. I'll admit that I was not afan of the books. The story was decent but I couldn't stand thewriting. The movie made way more sense and it was easier to fall inlove with the characters. I wish this could've just been made a moviefrom the start so there wouldn't have been so much bad press alreadyout about it. I'll end now by saying I am very pleased with this movie and hope allthe negativity won't prevent releases of the rest of the story. I'll bewaiting eagerly to see Anastasia and Christian on screen again!
