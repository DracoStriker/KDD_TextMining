The movie starts okay, like a romantic comedy. And the first 5/10minutes of the movie I was waiting for the super-sex-appealedcharacters but I was mistaken. And I knew two zero-sexy people weregoing to try to make a sexy movie for the next 2 hours! I must say thatI haven't read the book so my expectations came from book-reviews only.And those reviews were good! The book was good! But I'm not going toread it because know I have this view marked in my head about an idiotwho gives her virginity to a psycho! "Sign a contract!" Sorry, what?!Finally, to summarize my review about this movie: it's a very very verybad SM movie with non-sexy actors. BTW, I'm a women and I watched itwith girlfriends who think the same. Fifty shades of sh*t!
