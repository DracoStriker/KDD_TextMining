I will start off by saying that I did read the books and liked them. Iwill also say after seeing that Dornan was cast I expected to bedisappointed as I did not foresee him being able to pull off thatChristian. I was correct, he needed to bulk up more for the part as helooked far too scrawny. What I didn't anticipate about Dornan was thathis acting would terrible, laughable, my friend and I kept saying thisis worse than a terrible lifetime movie. I was also disappointed withhow choppy the movie flowed, I realize that it's difficult to fit thebook into 125 minutes but surely the writers could have made it flowsome. As for the scenes, I expected nudity but Dakota did a terriblejob portraying the innocent virgin Anastasia Steele. You'd think shewas cast as slut in terrible porno (script included). Lastly I will sayLuke Grimes appeared like a grease -ball. He's a great looking guy butthat hair and untrimmed facial hair, he did not play that part well.What, did they try to keep him from outshining Dornan by making himlook disgusting? Worst $9 movie ticket I've ever purchased, about halfway through I started texting and playing trivia crack.
