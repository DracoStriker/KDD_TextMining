Let's start out by saying what a huge fan i was of the books. I readall three in less than two weeks. Words can not express how excited iwas to see this movie. I knew going into it that the movie would, ofcourse, be somewhat different than the book. I'm sad to say that i'mpretty sure the director did not even read the book. I fail to see howthe actors got the parts they did. I don't know where these actors camefrom, but they had absolutely NO chemistry. The sex scenes were notsexy at all. The movie was literally so bad that I left halfwaythrough. I now have to read the books again to get that horrible filmout of my head. Although, i'm pretty sure the movie ruined the booksfor me as well. I'm beyond disappointed. If I could rate it with nostars, i would have.
