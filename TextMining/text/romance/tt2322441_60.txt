First of all, I've always believed that I was more of a "review reader"rather than a "review writer" but this movie got me so frustrated andso angry that I felt I needed to write my review. I wanna begin withDanny Elfman score on this film. If you wanna make an erotic movie thesmartest thing to do is to put erotic and sensual music. But this moviemade me feel like I was watching an episode of Desperate Housewives.This movie sure picked a fantasy score when It should have been betterwith a more dark twist like the way Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross dowith films. Second of all, I can't begin to imagine how insulted theBDSM community must feel about the film. This thing called film waswrong about the whole idea of BDSM and turned it into a romantic highschool movie. This idea of BDSM in this film is unsafe and totallyerroneous. Then, let's go to the acting. I had higher expectations onthe acting. Watching Jamie try to do an American accent was dreadful,watching him try to make a dark Christian Grey was painful. Dakota is asexy woman rather than a awkward girl described in the book. Every timeDakota bites her lip, made me feel like I was watching Angelina Jolietrying to be naive and awkward, this poor intent of awkwardness wasidiotic. Lets go to the horrible pick it was to put "One line-Onescene" Rita Ora and Luke Grimmes in this film. The only reason Imgiving a 2 out of 10 is because of the Soundtrack. This movie was acomplete waste of time. I got bored in the cinema and decided to staythe whole time because I already paid for it.
