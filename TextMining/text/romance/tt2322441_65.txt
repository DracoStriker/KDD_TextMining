Without getting into the awful acting, the complete lack of chemistrybetween the two leads and the fact that on more than one occasion, oneor both of them look bored of the whole situation - all of which seemsto have been covered previously, my concern is with the affect thisfilm is going to have on the safety of some women.As a submissive and a person who has spent years in the D/s (BDSM)community, I am scared to death about the damage this film could do topeople who are interested in exploring the kinkier side of sex. Thereare some GLARING inaccuracies in the way Christain Grey behaves and theway a real Dominant would behave . Grey is NOT a Dominant.... Grey isan abusive, bullying, f*&?ed-up control freak.If this film had a BDSM consultant, then that person should be SHOT; ifthe producers did not see fit to hire a consultant, then they should besubjected to some of the treatment that was portrayed in the film.If people are interested in BDSM, please please please do yourhomework! Check out websites like www.fetlife.com where you can chat topeople who have real experience and do not let ANYONE use a riding cropon you like Grey does!!
