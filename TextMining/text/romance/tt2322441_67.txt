This was a horrible movie, I loved the books because of the chemistrythey had. The movie very much lacked that. Missed important parts.Really disappointed with every character they picked.You could tell theactors were not comfortable with each other. Also really bummed how themade Ana seem so dumb. Hopefully in ten years when they remake thismovie they will do it right. I knew the movie wouldn't be the same asthe book, just was really hoping they would of focused more on the plotline verses the horrible played out sex scenes. Zero of the charactersfit. I was really hoping that it would get better as the movie went on,but it got to the point where I couldn't wait for the train wreck to beover.
