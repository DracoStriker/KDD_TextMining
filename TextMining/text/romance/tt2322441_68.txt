There was quite a huge build up to this movie, a Valentine releasebased on one of best selling books of 2011, lots of sex and nudity,this movie had everything to entertain, but alas it did not. It wasrather dragged, boring and utterly un-entertaining. It was reallytorturous sitting through the running time and it felt rather apunishment to watch this movie. It might interest the blonde-hairedmonkey girls whose favorite movie is "Twilight" but surely not toanyone with even a little bit of taste for movies.You can surely give this movie a miss, rather give this movie a missfor your peace of mind. The two leads had no attractiveness but ratherseemed half-dead, especially Dakota, who seemed like a zombie takenstraight out of Zombieland.P.S: Anyone planning to force start their sexual life, take yourgirlfriend to this movie and she will surely breakup with you. Adios !
