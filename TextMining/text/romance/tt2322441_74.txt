this stupid film has no storyline; it has stupid dialog; it has all thestupid excuses for cold sex, sex, sex, sex that people call itromance??? another word, it is pure plain stupid film; this isHollywood version of porn being sugar coated as romance so that is canpull in audience; else, it wouldn't make it to the big screen. Neverthought there'd be a day when porn made it into Hollywood and the sadthing is, people makes it happened. Twilight was a film about lovebetween the couple that was slowly developed and they didn't have sexuntil marriage. Whereas Twilight was white, 50 shades was black; theauthor was inspired by Twilight and copycat it and made it intosomething ugly that demeans women. We should be ashamed of supportingsuch trash; how low our culture has gone. We have become a people oflow intelligence because we can't distinguish what is good and what isbad.
