Terribly written book. How is this listed as drama / romance? If womensee anything romantic about abusing women, flogging and spanking awoman tied up then i don't know what romance is. I posted on face bookdon't waste your money. I didn't realise my wife is a sheep no pun asI'm Welsh and shes condemned me and my valid opinion that the film isterrible amongst the worst I've ever seen telling me I'm jumping on theband wagon bashing the film which i hope will be a flop... Go aheadwaste money and time watching it then come back and see my i told youso. They're making another two of these. I cant believe it and ca tstand the hysteria and how women are flocking to see a film makingwomen look downtrodden and submissive to a Mr big shot who clearly hasissues..
