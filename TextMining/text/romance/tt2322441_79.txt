I didn't read the book because I am intelligent enough to dig throughthe reviews and figure out that it was poorly written at best. Withthat being said, I went to watch this movie because my friend boughtthe tickets and gave me no option. In all honesty had I not left my carparked at the restaurant I would have walked out of the theater within20 minutes of the movie starting. This movie came down to me as a poorattempt at producing an instructional BDSM porn video for teenagers.Quite frankly I don't understand why every other comment herereferences horny, middle aged and over weight housewives. I'm far fromthat, very satisfied in that department; but what I was really hopingfor was a reason to dig into the book. And without any doubt in my mindthis movie gave me every reason to say NO! I won't let my intelligenceget raped by this garbage attempt at writing. Let alone the movie failed to give a true light into the BDSM world! Iwould have been better off watching a good old porn next to my hubbyand have a good old time than wasting my time and money on thisgarbage. My friend still thinks I should read the book as in her wordsthe movie was nothing like it. I still say no thank you! There arethousands of erotica out there that are better written. ****Spoiler alert**** the amount of pubic hair shown in this poorlywritten soft core porn was disgusting and the plot was very unrealisticand boring.
