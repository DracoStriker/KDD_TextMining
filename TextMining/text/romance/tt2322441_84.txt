I am ashamed to say, I spent $8 going to see this movie today, but agood friend of mine joined me in verbally tearing apart the movie, andthat made it bearable. We knew it was going to be a total bust as soonas it was announced it was going to be a movie. It's safe to say it completely destroyed the expectations of theaudience. The director's second mistake, (the first mistake making thismovie) was the actors.Maybe about a few minutes in I was kind of wanting it to end. Theacting and the "chemistry" (or lack thereof), was very cringe worthy.I'll give Johnson credit, she tried to fulfill her role... oh, how shetried.... but it just didn't fit. Dornan I bet is a great actor, but itwas difficult imagining and watching him turn into Christian Grey. Hisdiscomfort spoke VOLUMES, even the sex scenes were awkward and weren'tas racy as everyone (and me) thought it would be. I kind of hate to sayit, but even Pattinson and Stewart had more chemistry than those two.Their, uhm, "relationship" in no way, shape, or form, could even beginto reflect what true BDSM is. I'm not an expert, but I know for a factthere's more to it than whips, chains, handcuffs, and bondage. Theytried, but failed miserably to accurately depict the fundamentaldynamics of a D/s relationship. I'm pretty sure you're not supposed towalk on eggshells with your dominant in fear he might get angry. I'mpretty sure you're supposed to respect your submissive's personal spaceand not track him/her down and show up unexpectedly at their locationand demand what they're doing every second of everyday, sounds a littleimpulsive and controlling, would you agree? All in all, my suspicionshave been confirmed and this was probably one of the worst movies I'veever seen and the worst book I've ever read."My inner goddess is doing somersaults in my head at the sight ofhim... yum." <----- paraphrased, but you get the idea.Who says that??So done.*Click*
