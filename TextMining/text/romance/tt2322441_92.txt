Anastasia Steele, is an English Literature major on the verge ofgraduation when her best friend, a journalism major, gets sick and asksher to do an assignment for her, to interview Christian Grey, thewealthy businessman who is speaking at their impending graduationceremony. The two hit it off right away; the awkward young woman is immediatelyturned on by his power and control, and he's drawn to hernaiveté.......So here we are, thank you Hollywood, for really scraping the barrel onmaking that precious dollar.I don't blame the director at all for the atrocity I've just seen. Theblame is entirely on 'novelist' E.L. James. If they were not so bigheaded, let Patrick Marber's rewrite be predominant,then this couldhave been something else.Instead, we get an inane script, one of the worst of the year, spoutedout by what appears to be a confused cast, and Dornan, no matter howbeautiful he is, just seems like an automaton throughout the entiremovie.Yes, the man is troubled, he's insecure, and gets his kicks from his'dirty rotter' antics. But it doesn't hold, and scenes that aresupposed to be titillating, become laughable, almost on the verge of aZucker type movie.When you look at it, the audience have got it all wrong, it's not softcore cheeky cheeky viewing, its consumerist pornography, focusing moreon the money,the lifestyle, rather than the selling point.It's this generations Disclosure, this generations Indecent Proposal,even Basic instinct, and I guarantee, if this was made 25 years ago,one Michael Douglas would have taken the lead role.It's nothing new, the chemistry is beyond poor, and I was leftscratching my head.....This has really made that much money, and in turn, its bore one of themost unnecessary franchises ever produced in movie history.It's awful, but it looks good, I'll give it that.
