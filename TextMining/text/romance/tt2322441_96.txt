The title speaks for itself, you might as well watch Porn with the oneyou love than this piece of movie garbage. Acting was bad, chemistrywasn't there, and worst of all it was filled with horrible/clichéscripts. I would recommend watching Porn instead, it's cheaper (hell it'sbasically free at this day and age PLUS the choices are limitless),chemistry is usually better between the actors, you see MUCH more ofthe actual sex, and best of all you don't have to sit and watch it foralmost 2 hours. It kinda speaks for itself if a 50 dollar porn scene outclasses amulti-million dollar movie.
