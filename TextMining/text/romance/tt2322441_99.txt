After reading all these ridiculous reviews on here i had to post one ofmy own. Firstly, as a woman who is completely comfortable with myselfand who has previously been in an abusive relationship, i cancategorically state that this film does not in any way demoralise womenand does not at any time promote rape. Ana does these things becauseshe wants to!Do any of you people know what rape is? Secondly, if youread the book and enjoyed it, i don't see how you can't like the film.Sam Taylor-Johnson has done a brilliant job of making the film classyand not in any way gratuitous. Lastly the acting was in my opinionexcellent, i thought Dakota Johnson played Ana exactly how she wasdescribed in the book with just the right amount of shyness andinquisitiveness. As for Jamie i now can't imagine anyone else playingChristian, the chemistry was also apparent throughout (not sure wherepeople are coming from with that). I think this film is receiving someharsh criticism and for what? It's true to the book, if you don't likethe book don't see it!
