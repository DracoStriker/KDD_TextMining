This is a sweet combination of all factors in the movie; the actors,the actresses, the choices of the places, the story plot, even thesoundtrack. I love every single of it. Expect to feel warm andheartbroken at the same time in the movie. It's been says afterwatching it, I still cant stop thinking about this movie. You'd betterwatch it with someone who could provide a shoulder to cry on for you...:)) My favorite (which seems to be everyone's favorite as well) isduring the wedding ceremony where Will seemed so alive again. My mostheart-breaking scene is when Will said "will you be here?" on the lastscene. That is when I burst into tears a lot. like A lot.
