I get it that the rating isn't THAT great. I get that the movie did notreceive a lot of appreciation.I was even hesitant to watch it, but I thought of giving it a try.And I was amazed. What a MOVIE! The happiness she propagates.The sadness she faces when she fails to do what she wants to.She, wearing the yellow-black socks. Wow! And Longbottom looks verycool, in the "Jealous Boyfriend" look.There is no way any other actress could be cuter than Emelia Clarke.Brilliant movie.A must watch. :)
