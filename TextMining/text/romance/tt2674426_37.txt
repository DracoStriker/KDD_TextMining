As an aspiring movie producer/director, I was amazed by this film! Yes,10/10 is very presumptuous of me and may be a slight exaggeration, butpersonally I loved every second of the movie and was anxiously dying towatch it all over again the second it ended! This movie makes you thinkin different ways and to think in their shoes, which I LOVE. I alsomight love this so much because I can relate due to my brother having aborn disease where he cannot walk. When people see this film, some ofWill's ways of thinking are very unorthodox to some and viewers maythink the character is crazy, but understanding the life thathandicapped people live, I thought it was perfectly executed. This filmwas a fantastic movie! The location, the actors, the music scorer, etc.It all blew me away and I loved it!!!!! 10/10 would recommend.
