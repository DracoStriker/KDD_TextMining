I admit that I have read the book and so when the movie came out, Ijust HAD to go see it. So I drag my poor husband and we went to watch alate show that was relatively full. I didn't tell him anything aboutthe movie and I watched him watching it. He actually really enjoyed it.The movie was lovely. The movie itself was beautiful. The scenery wasset somewhere is rural England. There are green pastures, a castle andbeautiful stone walkways. We first meet Lou, a beautiful,charming, bubbly girly girl who is astrong character but maybe a little too comfortable with her currentlife and then we have Will. Dashing Will! Sarcastic, funny, a littlemean at first. They are world apart but through fate ( and Willdisabilities) they met and slowly realize what one possessed, the otherneeds. Even if they never really knew it. As the movie progress, they falls for each other and we all fall forthem. I loved Emily as Lou and Sam as Will. They played their rolesperfectly and the chemistry between then was undeniable. I thinkeveryone should go and watch this movie if you love romantic comedy. Itis hilarious at times and yet sweet. I assure you that you'll feelevery emotion out there with this movie. It's so beautiful. Go watch it and judge yourself. For me, this is an amazingly beautifullove story.
