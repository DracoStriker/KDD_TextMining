One of the most romantic films I have seen for some time. Of course itsa weepy, and how I blubbed, though I have previous in this regard, butit also swells the heart and leaves you with a beautiful warm glow.This should make real stars of the two main players with Claffinexcellent as someone who's life has been destroyed by an accidentleaving him not just paralysed, but also without the will to carry on.But the true stand out is Clarke, who's unquenchable cheerfulness andsunny outlook on life in the face of his depressed hostility has to beseen to be believed and maybe starts to turn him around? A lovely filmwith a beautiful ending.
