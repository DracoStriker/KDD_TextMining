From the very beginning, Me before you, grab my attention and engagedme in its well presented drama. It is amazing how Emilia Clark is ableto be light, funny and very real at the same time. Her acting is superbin every way. She goes into the seriousness of the story convincing uswith her authentic performance. My youngest daughter Michelle was bornwithout her left arm, she has 30% below the elbow missing from birth.My experience with her change the way I saw individuals withdisabilities for ever. Movies with individuals with disabilities touchme very deeply. "Me before you", caught me by surprise, because I wentto see a comedy. And the impact of the depth of the story push me tothe moments when I was dealing with my daughter darker moments, whichwere a few. If you are sensitive to the pain and suffering of others,go see this movie, it is entertaining and it gives you the opportunityto see two young actors reach a level in their careers which place themin a category with great performers.
