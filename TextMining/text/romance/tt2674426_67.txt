What a horrible message (not even tackling the issue with euthanasiahere), what terrible superficial characters! So, what's the idea: thesimple working class girl, not having access to proper education anddecent future, finds her mission in serving a rich, paralyzed guy, whothrows her some money before dying because she allowed him to stick hisnose in her breasts and kiss her. Watch carefully, young girls!
