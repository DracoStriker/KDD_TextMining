I loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love thebook. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she wasjust playing herself cause she has a personality like that in reallife. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes,the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved everysingle outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me veryemotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born toplay Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film andthe rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some partsfrom the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was stillamazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie isamazing as well.
