I definitely consider this movie part of the chic flick genre which Iusually avoid, but I could not stop myself from watching Emilia Clarke.It was so refreshing to see her doing something besides the mother ofdragons. Don't get me wrong -- I love the Khaleesi as much as everyother strong woman and Game of Thrones fan, but in this movie, I foundher personality, likability and sometimes playful quirkinessdelightful. It was mesmerizing and enough to make me glad I had watchedthe movie. Of course Sam Claflin is brilliantly handsome so there wasno hardship there, either.I found the movie somewhat reminiscent of The Fault in our Stars butwithout the waterworks that movie elicited. I would have preferred adifferent ending, but we don't always get what we want. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with a boyfriend but if youhave a free night or want a slow night with a gal pal and a glass ofwine, this movie might be worth a watch.
