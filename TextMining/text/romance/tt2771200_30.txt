To start Disney come on the casting choices were not good. The moviedoes not do justice to the original and i would imagine Walt in turningin his grave. The CGI was HORRIBLE and i mean Absolutely Terrible. theworst part is in my opinion this hurts the original because it may turnyounger people away that haven't see the original animated version andthat is the one worth watching. I understand it will still make a tonof money but that is not do to the content because it Garbage!
