I've seen better produced YouTube videos. I kept thinking the theaterhad mistakenly played an early rough cut.The sound mixing was amateurish. At one point in an early song youcould barely hear, let alone understand, the words of the main singerbecause the orchestral music was overpowering it. All throughout themovie the mixing sounded very uneven to me.Luke Evans did not make a good Gaston. I've liked him in other moviesbut in this one his acting was more boorish than his character.The effects for the non-human characters (except the Beast) werehorrendous. It reminded me of the animation in the old Christmas showslike Rudolph the Reindeer, the Misfit Toys, Frosty the Snowman, etc.The effects were bad enough to be distracting (especially Mrs. Pottsand Chip).If your only reason for seeing this film is for the effects, doyourself a favor and skip it.
