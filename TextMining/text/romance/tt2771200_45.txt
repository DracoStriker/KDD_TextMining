Disney trying to top themselves. This live-action rendering of thestudio's 1991 animated version of the oft-told fairy tale is Disney'sway of giving family-friendly audiences a 'treat' while raking in bigmoney the easy way: by delivery a presold product, one with name andsong value--and built-in approval ratings. At a debutante ball in 18thcentury France, an old hag casts a spell on the partygoers after she isrebuffed (seems she's an enchantress in disguise, though we have noidea why); the selfish prince of the manor is then turned into abeastly creature, while his attendants are turned into (talking)objects. Her spell will be broken once the prince learns about truelove, though this must happen before the last pedal on theenchantress's rose falls... Ideally, this material is timeless andshould entertain those who do not know the story and approach it with afresh perspective. However, while Disney's previous version broke newground for animated musicals, this dark, lead-footed endeavor neverlifts off, remaining flatly earthbound despite the familiar songs andcharacters. When trying for a little humor, scenarists Stephen Chboskyand Evan Spiliotopoulos cannot come up with anything other than drysarcasm, which doesn't wear well on their princess Belle, played by amiscast Emma Watson. Whether feigning indignation or attempting toregister awe, Watson approaches her part with a firm jaw and arighteous tone, as if this were a feminist mock-up; when she asks theBeast if he's joking when he offers his castle to her, she sounds likethe captain of a cheerleading squad. The art direction and design ofthis preconceived blockbuster is fussy and forgettable--no one willcome out of this movie saying that it transported them to another timeand place--while the unobtrusive supporting cast plays it safe, perhapsso as not to be in competition with their animated counterparts.Somewhere, French filmmaker Jean Cocteau (who helmed the 1946 version,"La Belle et la Bête") is smiling, for trendy blockbusters come and gobut art remains truly timeless. *1/2 from ****
