I have re-watched this in theaters this weekend, so I come fresh withthis movie in mind. Having said that, my perception of this movie has not changed. I willalso add that this story was my favorite Disney story growing up.Having watched it twice now, my experience has remained the same. Istill got lost in the story, the imagery, the music, and the singing. The plot was almost completely the same as that of the cartoon version,with a few additions. I very much loved these new additions as theyadded depth to the story and closed some plot holes. It also helped tobetter establish the relationship between Belle and the Beast. P.S. Loved the gay millisecond! I don't know what all the fuss wasabout.
