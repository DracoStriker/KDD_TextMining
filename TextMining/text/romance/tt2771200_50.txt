"Beauty and the Beast" retells the Disney's version of the Frenchfairy-tale written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve andpublished in 1740. The story is very similar to the magnificent 1991animation and highly attractive. However this 2017 version is uneven,with the most boring songs that anyone could imagine and reasonableacting despite the great names in the cast. But the top-notch ComputerGraphic Imagery (CGI) and the cinematography are worthwhile watching.Keep awake along the musical scenes and you may like and be surprisedby this version. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Bela e a Fera" ("The Beauty and the Beast")
