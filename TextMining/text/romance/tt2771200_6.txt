Where do I start. This adaptation of Disney's 1991 Beauty and the Beastwas an utter disappointment. Emma Watson as Belle was extremelyunconvincing from the start to the end. She had the same expressions asthe actress from Twilight. The animators did a terrible job with theBeast. He looked fake and lifeless. They could have used special makeupto create the beast similar to the Grinch where we get to see JimCarrey's expressions. The side character animations were poorlyexecuted. Overall I felt the film was rushed as there was lack ofcompassion and chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of CGIand green screen which could have been replaced by normal acting,because then why make an animated version of an animated film? This isby far the worst remake of an animated classic.
