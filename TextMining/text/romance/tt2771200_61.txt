I found this version of Beauty and the Beast to be quite refreshing.Tailor-made for the whole family to see, Emma Watson in the female lead(Belle) is a pure delight to behold. Vibrant colors provided for astunning visual. The film approaches all emotional levels. The singingand dance sequences were most enjoyable. I've seen this movie pickedapart by folks who I just think didn't want to like the movie andtherefore exercised their critical writing ability to tear it down. Isay, "Thanks Disney Studios!"
