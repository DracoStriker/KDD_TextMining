In any case I think this was very beautiful, following the story fromthe animation, really is a great transformation from animation to liveaction picture. The acting is good, the characters well portrayed andthe visuals just as beautiful as the animation.Location, seating & time: Big Bio, Herlev, Denmark - Bio 2, row 4 seat6, 8, 10 & 12 - 18.03.2017 at 15.15
