A fabulous movie, I enjoyed every moment. So beautifully done that Iwould watch it again. It's a true musical as they used to be. I criedand laughed, it brought out many emotions. It's a great family film.The artistry and special effects make a great Disney style fantasy cometo life. The music and songs were very pleasant in typical Disneyfashion.
