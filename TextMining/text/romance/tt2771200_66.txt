The director hit the targets he was aiming for, it's disappointing thata quality film was not on the list. It seems the movie just assumesthat you will care about the characters. I found very little to like inthe character development. The times where the creators thought he wasdriving home a successful point the scene stinks of silly politics andI heard giggles throughout the theater. A bright spot was beast's sadsolo which was a great (albeit unintended) comic touch. I am prettyconfused about the higher ratings online. As a lifelong Disney fan Ireally can't think of a more poorly made Disney movie. To be fair thevisuals were absolutely stunning, visually this was a real treat. Ivery much appreciated the that the set was stylized to perfection. It'svery ironic that there is such a tip of the hat to reading when theilliterate are perhaps the only ones that will truly appreciate thispoorly timed mess. The one save for the loss of my evening is that Idid now have expose my 4 year old girl to this mess.
