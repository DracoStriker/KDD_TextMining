An adaptation of the fairy tale about a monstrous-looking prince and ayoung woman who fall in love.If you have one of the all-time greatest cartoons, there are things youcan do with it. Turn it into a musical is one. But turn it into alive-action version with practically nothing changed (though a fewscenes added) may not be your best idea. Especially if such a versionrelies on CGI and you have neither the time nor the ability to pull itoff.But if you are going to do it anyway, I suppose you could do muchworse. Emma Watson was the ideal casting choice and no one else wouldhave worked. No one. Josh Gad is spot on as LeFou. The Beast could bebetter, perhaps. My biggest casting complaint is Maurice. I suppose inthis version he is less eccentric, but why is this the case? And why sotall? Kevin Kline is fantastic, but is he really Maurice?
