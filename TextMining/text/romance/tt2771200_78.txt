Growing up this is my favorite Disney movie! I was curious how theywere going to incorporate the talking household items. I assumed theywould be more like a cartoon rather than human like animations. Butafter watching the movie, a few times, I love the new "human" aspect ofit. This movie invited adults into the theater and not just children. Ienjoyed how the changed up the songs a little bit in order toincorporate the characters. The actors did a great job of mixing theirpersonality from the reference points from the older animated movie.The movie also captured my attention and was energetic enough to keepme engaged and excited throughout the movie even though I knew thefinal outcome.
