I own 463 3D blu-rays and this is easily the best movie in mycollection. I was a fan of the original cartoon but this live versionis much better in every category. The costumes and sets werebeautifully rendered, Emma Watson is adorable as Belle, the music isgorgeously orchestrated and every singer is top notch! The 3D is"medium-strong" to "strong" and is very consistent. There aren't many"pop-outs" but every scene contains multiple layers and plenty of depthand the musical numbers are where the 3D really shined! Oneparticularly memorable scene occurs at the end of the first musicalnumber and it reminded me of The Sound of Music but in stereo-vision!Many scenes inside and outside of the castle also looked amazing in 3D,especially the musical numbers "Be Our Guest", which has the one"pop-out" I remember, and "Beauty and the Beast". The ballroom, withits elaborate chandeliers is particularly stunning, and the 3Drendering makes it and the entire castle seem ENORMOUS! The coloursREALLY pop on my 4K OLED and everything has so much detail! This movieadds additional depth to the storyline, which adds to characterdevelopment and it even adds some new songs which I really enjoyed. Ilaughed.. I cried... I danced (in my head)... and I sang my heart out!Instant classic! In my list of top 10 films of all time!Best 3D film in my collection! (although I had to import it from India)BETTER than the original!!!!
