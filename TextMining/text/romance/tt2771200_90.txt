I loved it. It held true to the Disney animation that three of my girlshave loved (10, 14, 18). My oldest daughter is 18 years old and myyoungest is 10. I have watched the Disney animation for 18 + years(toinclude the the story lines I was exposed to as a child). The 2017version was exceptionally brilliant. It held true to the old Disneyversion (plus some) and evoked many memories of watching the animationwith all three of my daughters as little girls. This particular versionadded some extra lessons/themes needed to be addressed and taughtrelevant to this time and age/generation (though not directly statedgreat minds will draw the conclusions to the underlying theme). I lovedit!!!!!
