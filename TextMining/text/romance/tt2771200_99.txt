The age old story of Beauty and the Beast is a story that will continueto be told for generations. This new production bringing Beauty and theBeast into the modern honestly shocked me. At first I was verysceptical of what it would be like, will they adjust the story, willthey ruin the image of the Beast, will Emma Watson play Belle correctly(for me anyway since she is essentially the focus of the film). All ofthese questions were racing through my mind. But. When I went to go seeit I was quite astonished at what I watched. I was very very impressedwith it. However I am critiquing this and as a result I though thatGaston was casted wrong, in the Disney original Gaston was a strongpowerful man that was large in stature and was bulky. When watching thenew 2017 version, Gaston was in good shape but he did not fit thedescription of the cartoon original. I mean I get it, he is a cartooncharacter and he was exaggerated for the audience and so on, but stillcome on, try to find a bigger guy. Other than that I cannot reallythink of anything else that I didn't really dislike. They nailed theiconic ball room scene as well as the playful: 'be our guest' scene.All iconic scene hit their mark and I cant say they let me down. Iwould highly recommend this film to anyone, family or friend. Follow meon Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling
