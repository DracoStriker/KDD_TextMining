Vicious animal cruelty used flippantly to add some kind of edge to anotherwise soulless film.I like all kinds of movies, but...***SPOILER***...having a dog get brutally beaten to death in your film just foreffect isn't art, it's just sick.***END SPOILER***This is one of very few movies I left wishing I had never seen. Mighthave been of passing interest as a short film. There's simply notenough of substance or style in this movie to begin to justify the(unpleasant) experience of watching it.
