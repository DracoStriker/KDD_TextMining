I can't see the point of making The Lobster other than beingexperimental dramatic production geared towards Colin Farrell'sdowntrodden character similar to his depressing role in True Detective.It would have helped this bizarre film if it has been preceded by aliterary introduction as a scene setter. Instead the audience,if thereis one, is shown a film that isn't sci-fi or even a fantasy but ratherand allegory or metaphor for human relationships vs. society.This is strictly an art house film and even then those viewing it maywant their money back. I won't try to offer a synopsis because I am notsure of what I watched. In the end it was not a pleasing experience.
