Oh God, this thing was a real challenge to sit through. I kept wishingI wore a watch so I could calculate how much more agony I was going tobe forced to endure. Not having a watch made it even more unbearable asI kept thinking it's gotta be over in just a minute or two but no, itwent on and on and on. And the longer it went on the less I knew whatit was about. By the end it seemed like a random collection of imageswith no rhyme or reason. Which was fine, I didn't care anymore, justget me the hell out of here. And the crowning blow was you don't evenget any lobster! Back in the day with "Attack Of The Crab Monsters" atleast you got some real crab activity. With this you get nothing. Nolobster, no butter, no fun.
