I created an IMDb account just so that I could let out some steam afterwatching this movie.As soon as the black screen came on and just before the credits I hadalready started shouting negativity at the screen with a real venom.I used phrases that I probably cannot repeat here but you probably canimagine what I spurted out. I don't think I've ever done that beforeafter watching a movie.I cannot understand how anyone could in anyway enjoy watching thismovie.Oh, wait, you mean it was on purpose? To get this reaction from peoplelike me? You enjoy this? The jokes are on you. I can't wait to use theline "Have you seen The Lobster?".The lowest grade in acting, voice, soundtrack and story. F- in allcategories.If you're reading this then DO NOT SEE this movie. Seriously, it's bad,very bad.This movie is "attempting to impress by affecting greater importance,talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed." or in one word:PRETENTIOUS.Of the worst kind.
