First and foremost this movie is not funny. The fact that all thecritics are raving about it is ridiculous and silly. It's like none ofthem want to admit they didn't like it because it is supposed to be allartistic and great or something.The movie could not have been worse. Not a single funny moment in theentire film. About as funny as cardboard and just about as colorful.There are not deeper meanings in the movie. It does not hint at humanthemes or reveal any sort of truths. It is simply a series of veryboring and stupid scenes collected together until finally it ends.If you watch it and think, "what the heck is this, I must be missingsomething". Do not worry. You did not miss anything, the movie is likea bad joke on the viewer.The Lobster is a looser and that is the truth.This may be the only honest and real review you ever read about thishorrible movie.
