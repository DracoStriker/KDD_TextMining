Concept and potential of movie is high; Actors played their role wellbut that could not help the film. You'd be sure to avoid this movie,the 7.6 rating it currently has is astonishing. How it would get pastthree stars is mind blowing. It drained so much from me watching thismovie. Unfortunately after going past the half way mark of the movie ihad to finish it......and i got there thinking the movie was threehours long. I'm taking the time here to type as much as i can to postthis comment to help you fellow IMDb followers to give a more accuratemovie rating. I do understand that people do have their own likes anddislikes however i would easily speak for the majority and say pleaseavoid. kind Regards and always looking out for your mental welfare.
