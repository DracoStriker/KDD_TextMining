Being a Yorgos Lanthimos virgin, I was attracted to the title by itsquirky premise and interesting cast list. I approached with cautiousoptimism, hoping to find a gem at the very least. What I found insteadwas a cinematic treasure trove.The Lobster follows David (Colin Farrel) in a society where it isunacceptable to be single. When David's wife leaves him he is sent toThe Hotel where he has 45 days to find a partner. If he finds one -awesome. If he fails, he will be turned into an animal. Of his choice,naturally.It's stylish, it's got technique, it's disorienting (in a good way), itasks questions about us and doesn't really care about hearing ouranswers. It instills within you the great sense of uneasiness that thecharacters must feel in this collection of increasingly odd situationsthrough stilted, brutally frank dialogue in a masterclass of a script.The performances, also, are stunning. I was pleasantly surprised byRachel Weisz in her subtly moving role as the Short Sighted Woman.Having watched it no more than five hours ago, I find myself recallingit as if it was a dream. The carefully considered combination ofediting and cinematography gives the feature that lifted, slightlyangled and unaligned feel. Its world presents itself to you in adisembodied kind of way and, in the way you may leave your bed after adream, you will leave the cinema questioning everything about it.I can honestly say The Lobster has entered the ranks of my favouritefilms. Go and catch this while it's still in cinemas - the criticallythirsty mind will not remain unquenched.
