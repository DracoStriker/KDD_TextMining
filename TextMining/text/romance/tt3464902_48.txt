Wow, people love this movie. My girlfriend, a fan of dystopian fiction,had been told she would like this, and was actually very excited aboutit. I found the premise offputting and thought it would be inherentlydepressing. So we went into the movie with different expectations, butby the halfway point, we both agreed it wasn't worth continuing.This is a very odd movie. People speak in awkward sentences as thoughthe dialogue was written by someone who specializes in English as asecond language instructional audio tapes. The basic premise (singlepeople must quickly become coupled or they will be turned into animals)is never explained, meaning it's not really dystopian fiction but justabsurdist drama, and as that it's not that interesting.It's a very unpleasant movie. People do awful things, but no one ishorrified; the movie is, perhaps, about how numb people are to thetragedies of the world, but for me, it was just a weird mix ofdisturbing, detached, and dull.From what I've read, some people find this movie really funny. I foundalmost nothing about it funny. Or interesting.After we gave up, we did check out the synopsis on wikipedia to findout how it all turned out. That convinced us we'd made the rightdecision.If you like dark, arty, abstract, emotionally distant satire, you mightlike this.
