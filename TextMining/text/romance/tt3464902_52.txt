This movie is sick, pointless, a waste of time, and one of the worstmovies I have ever seen. Buyer beware. If you are a sadistic zombiemaybe you will like it. If not,you should avoid it. I saw no redeemingvalue. I Went with 5 other people, none of them liked it either. Therewas a line of people wanting their money back so I was not alone. Theactors were competent, but I found it difficult to find any sympathywhatsoever for any of the characters. This for me is a sign of a badmovie. We have a very violence loving society so maybe this movie isjust a statement of our society. Spend your money on somethinguplifting not depressing and vacuous.
