Never in my life have I gotten so mad watching a movie. It was theworst experience I've had in front of my screen. I do not recommendthis to sane people. The character is built to get the viewer angry.This is a desperate way of trying to make a different kind of movie.Yes it is very atypical but also extremely annoying. I won't give anyspoilers but be warned this might not be everyone's movie if you want arelaxing night. Things don't make any sense to the point of being aburden. The only reason I had to bear with it is because of otherpeople wanting to watch it. If one doesn't get satire or react well toit - DON'T WATCH THIS!
