I started out with high expectations. Since the movie has a good IMDbrating. The society it showed was interesting, and very disturbing inits solutions for the problem of single people. But I could tolerateall until the middle of the movie. Then, a companion animal was killedin a cold-blooded fashion by a psychopath. And the owner didn't stopthe action or even protest. So, I am done with this movie, that's it.It gets a 1 rating from me. I have no further interest in the rest ofthe movie, intriguing as it could be. It's dead to me. I'd rather watchcomedies about the STASI. I don't need this kind of abuse. I'll rentsome weird German S & M movies if I want more.
