So we get a different perspective on relationships after having watchedthis film? No. Or perps we get a look into deep human to humanalienation that governs the brutal world of partner selection outthere? No. Do we get anything. Yes. Our money back, maybe.The best part of this film was the ending, when it finally ended. Andthats the spoiler right there for you all: this film does end.This film was a waste of waste. It did not have a stupid ending, butrather, a stupid beginning. And a middle. Every second of this film wasstupid. It asked the stupidly misplaced and stupid question of "what ifthe couple-binding norms of western society were to be completelystrict and to the letter". And answered that stupid question in themost stupidest western society way as possible. All fancy and artsy andall. So there, I refuse to gain some perspective, examine this work ofmystery in terms of the symbols it so pretentiously shoves at my face,I refuse to think that this piece of stupid fish is trying to shed thisor that light on this or that whatever something or another, I alsorefuse to get affected by the beauty and drama contained in this film.Too pretentious for any of those merits.The sequel will be named "the lobster and the lobsterer" I suppose.
