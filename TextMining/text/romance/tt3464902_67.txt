I decided to write a review on this movie for the sake of ranting andto (hopefully) inform people about it. Everything checked out aboutthis movie - yet it was awful. I'm taking matters into my own hands.The fact is that the characters are emotionless or at least theysuppress their emotions. It's a dystopian world they live in andsociety has everyone's lifestyle and behavior programmed. There are alot of slow motion scenes and unnecessarily so. Those were particularlydull and hard to focus on. Many scenes were unnecessary, lingering waytoo long on the same thing.I often felt my attention drifting away and I actually had to make aneffort to register what was going on. The dialogue is monotonous, fullof intervals of silence yet abrupt. The music was awful, deliberatelyweird and out of place I think. There's a specific thundering sequencethat was so unbelievably annoying and repetitive that my friend and Ilaughed about it. The ending was indefinite and the most boring of all.I was indifferent to the Lobster and that's how it left me feeling aswell. Indifferent to everything except the time I wasted preparing towatch this movie and watching it. I would've abandoned it by the 5thminute if it weren't for good company. So that's that, overall a snobbyfilm. Reminds me of the Grand Budapest Hotel, except that at least hadaesthetics.
