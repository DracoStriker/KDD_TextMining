"The Lobster" is the first English language film directed by YorgosLanthimos ("Dogtooth"), and stars Colin Farrell as David, a man who isrecently separated from his wife and must now lodge at a government runhotel in a near future Britain where he must find a suitable partner inforty-five days, otherwise he will be turned into an animal of hischoosing.This is a very strange movie, the presentation is very serious andoppressive (using the Mozart pieces repeatedly over slow motion motionmontages and Rachel Weisz narrating the story very sternly), but at thesame time the delivery of the lines and the odd way each character actsmade me laugh at the ludicrousness of it all. It's all done in such adeadpan manner and the supporting cast made up John C. Riley andseveral British television comedians (Olivia Colman, Ashley Jensen,Ewen MacIntosh) help propel the comedy.There's plenty of unique ideas about relationships (people comingtogether because they have something trivial in common, like nosebleeds; being assigned a child to stop newlywed couples arguing, etc.).The love story between Farrell and Weisz drives the second part of thefilm, showing the two at odds against the world, trying to find a placefor themselves in a world with conflicting ideologies (she's from agroup of loners who hide out in the forest, their leader has a strictpolicy on romantic relationships and is just as oppressive as thegovernment they're fighting against)."The Lobster" is a unique movie that is worth watching if you enjoyquirky comedies or just something different.
