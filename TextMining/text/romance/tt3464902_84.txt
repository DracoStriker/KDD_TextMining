I have read reviews on this waste of time that call it a comedy. Okayif you have a very sick sense of humor. I will admit there were veryfew scenes that were a little bit funny, depending on what one findsfunny. However, I spent most of the time wondering why I was stillwatching this. The idea of the film is interesting, the acting isacceptable, other than that give this a pass until it is out of thetheaters. Oh, that is unless you think it will make you 'cool' to saythat you wasted that money and the time watching this film. My thoughtis that it won those awards because people were paid to do so. Filmstudents will see an example of what NOT to do. This could have been agood film had the approach to the characters been better done.
