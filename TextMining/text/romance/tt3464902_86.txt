I do not know if anything I am about to write would be considered aspoiler but here goes: I watched this movie last night before bed. Ihave seen way better and I am surprised that some of the actors in thismovie actually agreed to be in it? Story aside, this film was too longand did not go into enough detail about the why and when. I have seenway better from films that were not even shot as well as this one andwith an unknown cast. I cannot in good conscious recommend this filmunless you want to be bored. How this has a rating of 7.6 I am at aloss to explain? I am also disappointed in how they ended the film. Ithink that they let it run on for so long they did not plan an endingand just had to stop leaving the viewer hanging. I think overall thisstory has potential in the right hands of a competent director. Theacting talent was there. Overall though this was a letdown.
