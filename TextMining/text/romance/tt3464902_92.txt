Maybe it's because I did not understand the idea of the film, but comeon. What a waste.Horrible film and boring like hell. I even watched the whole film. Iwon't get these two hours again.I think the film started in a very strange matter. Okay, film's havestarted strange before and still been good, but this one. Not in ahundred years.I wanted to see the whole film, because it just had to become better.There had to be a finish. Nonetheless it's another film where you haveto think yourself. What will happen next? 1/10.
