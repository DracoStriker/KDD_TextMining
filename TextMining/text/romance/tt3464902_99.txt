Thinking that his wife no longer loves him, a man is sent to a hotelwhere he must find a partner within 45 days or be turned into an animalof his choice.Although it sounded like a good idea, this movie turned out to be acompletely different animal than what I was expecting. It portrays aseries of events, taken by a couple of characters which seem to becompletely retarded. Whatever they do, even the most basic acts, likespeaking, seems awkward, stupid and even sometimes degrading. Theevents which occur seem to lead nowhere, thus making it as boring ashell, very slow paced and ultimately pointless.While it manages to keep you focused for a whopping 10 minutes, itsimply loses grip thanks to its idiotic and senseless plot, not tomention the completely retarded characters. It's a very bad movie whichsimply insults your intelligence, presents absolutely nothing while itwas supposed to draw a smile on your face every once in a while. I'mvery surprised that this kind of abominations receive such largeacclaims and to say that it was an Oscar nominee makes matters evenworse.I cannot tell you how much I regret the time wasted with this nonsense.Furthermore, I simply cannot understand how the two main actors, ColinFarrell and Rachel Weisz, for whom I have high appreciation, decided toaccept such dreadful roles in such a bad movie. I can only encourageyou to avoid it by far but you would still want to see it out ofcuriosity as I did and eventually ending up in an utter disappointmentwhich is quite hard to express only by words.
