Typical, clichéd, boring and predictable. How many "spy" movies haveyou seen that make duty and honor become second to feeble humanemotions. When will Hollywood learn that spies are specially trainedprofessionals, they are not like regular people. If you are going tomake a love story/family movie, why revolve it around spies and WW2? Moreover the events of the movie doesn't make any sense. If anyone ofyou has an understanding of wars, conflicts, politics and nationalduty, you will find this movie appalling. Character-building is thesecond worst thing in the movie, first is the acting (Brad Pitt isalright but rest of the cast is horrendous). If you are going to watchit in cinema, please don't waste your time and money.
