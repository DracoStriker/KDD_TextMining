This is a short review. The single most important thing missing fromthis film is any kind of chemistry between Brad Pitt and MarionCotillard. Without that chemistry, even as a romantic chick flick, thismovie fails. Secondly, any student of WWII history knows that theGerman Blitz over England pretty much ended in May of 1941, and yetthis movie has London being blitzed multiple times in 1943. That didnot seem likely. On the positive side, there are some nice sets, andcostumes, and some moments of tension. But my overall impression isthat the movie is a joyless affair, for the actors, and particularlyfor the audience viewing it.
