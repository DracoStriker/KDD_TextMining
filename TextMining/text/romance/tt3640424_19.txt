"Allied' is the anti 'Casablanca'. Robert Zemekis is no Michael Curtiz."Allied' begins in Casablanca in 1942. It is a Casablanca made out offull cloth. In 1942, Casablanca was a thriving port city, yet we seecamels and nomads dressed as though they're in a Christmas pantomime.We are told after a man, a European man makes love to his wife, herepairs to the roof to cool his libido. Utter rot. This is a Casablancaof a fertile but poetic bent, but hardly factual. Didn't anyone botherto note that the US liberated French Morocco in 1942? Did anyone botherto not put Casablanca close to the Sahara desert? Camels, exoticcostume had a more appropriate place in Goulimine,once the prosperouscamel market of Morocco. And the tale goes from fancy to silliness asit is obvious from the opening scenes that Cotillard is a German agent.
