I saw "Allied", starring Brad Pitt-World War Z, The Curious Case ofBenjamin Button, and FYI, there is a second WWZ coming in 2017; MarionCotillard-The Dark Knight Rises, Contagion; Jared Harris-The Man FromU.N.C.L.E._2015, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Lizzy Caplan-Masters of Sex_tv, Smallville_tv.This is a WW2 spy/thriller/romance that reminded me of an older moviecalled 'Casablanca'. Brad, a Canadian intelligence officer, and Marion,a French resistance fighter, play spies that team up on a mission inNorth Africa in 1942. On their mission, they have to pretend to behusband and wife and one thing leads to another and well, they have areal romance. After the mission, Brad pops the question and they moveback to London and start a family-they have a little girl. That is whenJared, Brad's superior officer, informs Brad that they suspect Marionis really a German spy. Of course, Brad does not believe it but theygive him 72 hours to uncover the truth. If she is a spy, Brad mustexecute her himself. Otherwise, he will be facing a court-martial andthen be hung by the neck until dead. Lizzy plays Brad's sister. It's agood story, with good actors and supposedly, this is the movie thatbroke up Brad and Angelina. There were rumors of a real romance goingon between Brad and Marion on the set. I don't know if it's true or notbut the movie is good. It keeps you guessing on whether or not she is aGerman spy. It's rated "R" for violence, language, drug use and sexualcontent- including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 4minutes. I would probably buy it on DVD.
