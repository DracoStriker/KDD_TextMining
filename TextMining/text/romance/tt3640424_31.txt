I almost walked out 2/3 into the movie, the only reason me and my wifestayed, was we were right in the middle of the row. This is aFrankenstein of a mish-mash, a stupid concoction. Scenes from the movieresemble scenes from the following movies: Hanover Street, The EnglishPatient, Inglorious Basterds, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Devil's Own...Are we, the public, morons with an IQ of 10? Regarding the love story -there was absolutely no chemistry between Brad and Marion. The securityof the supposedly SOPs airfield from which the Lysanders flew, wasamateurish... The babysitter-German spy was ridiculous... The manner inwhich 4 french partisans dispatched a whole platoon of Germans - evenmore! The movie was so slow basically until half time, that I almostfell asleep! And the trailer is rubbish - you end up going to a soapyteary war-placed love story i/o a war action movie. Don't want to wastemore time... Sorry. You shouldn't either. You will be just filling thepockets of Mr. Zemekis and Mr. Pitt. Shame!
