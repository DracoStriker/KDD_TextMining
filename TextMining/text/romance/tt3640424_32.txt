Its hard to pinpoint what was out of kilter with Allied as the basicstory had potential. Perhaps it was the over glamorous look, a prettiedup version of the time period and location. Plus the 2 main characterswere just so unbelievable as spies. The clothing, the silly cardshuffle scene,the quick flight to and from France, the way they tooeasily manage to shoot all the Germans chasing them. A Boys Own view ofa hero spy? As for the swearing and lesbian characters, so historicallyout of place and very clunky as a result. Directors may get a kick outof filming a lesbian kiss but it wouldn't have taken place so publiclyin that time period and strange but true not everyone ran around sayingthe "f" word then. I do like love stories but this never felt true, itwas all too cardboard cut-out and contrived. My favourite actor was thebaby, just beautiful! Sorry but I was looking forward to a good storyand was very disappointed. It came across as an American version ofwhat they thought second world war spies should have been like ratherthan any attempt at accuracy, so had an almost "spoof" feel to it.
