This movie was showing lots of promise and was an enjoyable story untilthe producer or director decided to throw in a gratuitous scene withtwo lesbians kissing and some cocaine-snorters, which wrecked themovie. These details did nothing to add to the story, nor did they haveanything whatsoever to do with the story. It seems that this additionwas just another attempt to normalize homosexuality in the minds ofviewers. In 1940s England lesbians were firmly in the closet and wouldNEVER kiss romantically in public. Nor would Londoners openly snortcocaine at a public party. Adding these details destroyed any feelingthat you were experiencing life in the 1940s, thus destroying thecredibility of the movie. It seems that every movie or serial showthese days feels compelled to have openly homosexual characters, andfrankly I'm sick of it. I would otherwise have rated this movie a 7.
