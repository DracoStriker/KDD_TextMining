240: Allied. This comes from the great Robert Zemeckis who made Back tothe Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, two of my favorite movies ofall time. He recently came back to live action filmmaking after hisstint in motion capture. He made Flight and The Walk and now we come toAllied. Allied is about two people who meet in Morocco on a secretmission, they fall in love and get married. He later learns that shemight be a spy for the German army. It has a very Hitchcock vibe to it.Or at least it tries to. It is an old fashioned kind of movie where itfocuses more on the dynamics between their relationship. Even though itseems to be fairly thorough, it lacks something making the audiencebelieve in their feelings for one another. It is an extreme slow burnof a movie and each character is hiding something so it seems likethey're closed off from the rest of the world or nothing is real fromthem. Sadly I have to report that this was a slog to sit through. Itmoves really like sap pouring out of a tree. Brad Pitt for most of thetime is a non entity. He seems to be entirely too stoic until the veryend when we finally see some passion ignite in him that might have beenhelpful all along. It's just too slow. Most people will easily loseinterest in this and I can't say that I blame them. I give this movie aD.
