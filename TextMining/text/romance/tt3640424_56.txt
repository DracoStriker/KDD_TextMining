Oh know I hear you say, another WWII movie... Yes it was, but Bill Clinton saw more action in his office than was inthis movie. The action was deliberate, concise, and well executed tonot be the main feature of the movie but lay the foundation of whatwould be an unbreakable bond for the rest of the story. It sounds alittle cliché, and to a degree it is but it works.With an amazingly well setup wardrobe, subtle scenes, and body languagethat screams intimacy the opening scenes really captivated me and Ididn't even know it had grabbed me. It really brought me into theespionage life for the period but it was not over played with massivedrama, or super spy scenes, it was subtle, covert, to a point even calmnothing to tense. The middle was a little sluggish, and that is where the modern valuescrept into a period movie. It has almost become a part of every TVseries and movie to have an open gay couple as if TV and movies aretrying to prove something about diversity. Sigh....But where it all came together was the ending, I thought I knew... hellI even hoped for the best... but it was the visual and emotional strikethat I have to say was what blew me away. So much so it had me askingpersonal questions for some time afterwards.I loved this movie, yes there could have been improvements... ie PittsFrench... aghhhh... but overall pretty happy I took the time not onlyto watch it, but to believe it too.
