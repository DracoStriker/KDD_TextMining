To me it's surprisingly a good movie considering it's a romantic movie.Those are normally not the movies I go for. Well romance is a big wordbecause there is also plenty of action, as it is also a war movie. Thebest part of the movie is the chemistry between Brad Pitt and MarionCotillard. Starting as a casual professional encounter it grows deeperas the movie goes on. Without revealing anything about the movie theirrelationship gets rocky at one point due to certain circumstances. Atthis part there are some interesting intrigues that make you want tosee the rest of the movie to get answers. The cast of the movie is justtop notch. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard have nothing to proveanymore. They are both great actors and in Allied it just shows. Theaction scenes and all the rest of the movie are very well shot. Itcouldn't be more professional. A good story, great acting, everythingyou want when you watch a movie. Certainly worth a watch.
