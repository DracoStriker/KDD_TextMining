We didn't like this film too much, though it was entertaining most ofthe time and well-made in terms of costumes, colours and London WW2"feeling". Brad Pitt was, as in many movies, distant and nowhere neargreat acting. It's Pitt in different clothes and with different names.His love for Cotillard - who fits her part well - is neither convincingnor deepened, and works strange all the time. When it gets towardsshowdown, this lack of explanation tears the movie apart. BUT: manythanks to the director for portraying a real WW2 hero, the WestlandLysander! Aircraft fans wouldn't want to miss this!
