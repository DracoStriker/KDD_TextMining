Overall,it's a pretty good movie.I just love the style of the picture. Generally that World War 2 erahas that glamorous style to it, and leave it to Robert Zemeckis to addthat extra kick.Although I've Seen better costumes but this maybe because Canada didnot have the best uniforms out of the WWII crowd.And that made this movie strangely interesting. The 1st movie I everseen about Canada's involvement in the War. Maybe I have seen othersbut it's so rare that it makes this movie seem unique that the story isabout a Canadian wing commander who falls in love and builds a lifewith a woman who may not be all that she claims.Speaking of which, The best part of the movie is that drama. Though Ilove the art direction as it puts me in That WWII setting, the visualeffects do a good job of placing you right there, but the drama comingfrom Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard's connection on camera. It's thisconnection that's the most important and makes the movie what it is,and the emotion baggage is well worth it.So not much of a war epic or an espionage movie as I went to see if forbut it's a great love story set perfectly and beautifully in adifferent time and place worthy of checking out.
