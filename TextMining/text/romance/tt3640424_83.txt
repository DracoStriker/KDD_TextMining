Allied is a WWII tale in which we've seen it before but with adifferent take, it is an ideal drama-thriller-romance story but we canjust take the romance away since we can't really find a strongchemistry.The film's nature is very close to what a World War II environment feelshould be, but, its more amazing to know that not every design,especially on their clothing, are pulled out exactly as what we knewfrom history books. As quoted from the film's costume designer, JoannaJohnston during an interview with Fashionista: "I wanted to ground itin the time, but I also wanted to give it its own look, so you kind ofpick and mix, in that regard. I think it's a very attractive period,and it looks good to our contemporary eyes at this point in time, soit's not difficult to make it look good for the film. Nothing was astraight copy, it was a whole load of different influences or partsthat go into making your interpretation for the film.".Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard both looked lavishly good, with theirdresses and suits they both resemble power and class. Cotillard,notably, seemed to fit on every dresses, and no matter what you makeher wear, she remains stunningly gorgeous.Pitt and Cotillard had their share of talent throughout the film, eventhough the romantic charisma between the two didn't spark that bright,they were still able to carry and effectively played their role in avery compelling manner.As the biggest revelation unravels, the couple tried their best to savetheir relationship by running away, but only then that they realizedthat their love is not just built on survival, but also by sacrifice.
