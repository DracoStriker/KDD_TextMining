You'll either be picking it apart for being stupid, or you'll enjoy thepacing and beautiful look of the film."Allied" starts quickly with a pitch-perfect set-up and a truly solidfirst half-hour. You're drawn into the film and Cotillard and Pitt,like the cinematography, are just gorgeous. The film is entertaining,without question.That said, the film has a few too many period/cultural inaccuracies andalso a rather sloppy last half-hour that brings it down a bit.I just cant destroy the film for what amounts to 3-4 oversights. Whilethey are big problems in terms of 'how can you not get it right' , theyare still outweighed by the films overall production values,performances, and well-paced storyline. Allied is a good movie for those who want entertainment and wont be toodistracted by the historical mistakes. If these types of issues ruin amovie for you then don't watch it. For me this is a strong 6, and had immense potential to be so muchmore. Can we go back to the love scene in the car and shoot the rest ofthe movie again, because for a moment there I thought Zemeckis hadanother masterpiece. I wasn't disappointed overall, but the much lower budget "Anthropoid"was better.
