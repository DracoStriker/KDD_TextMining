I though it was surprisingly good. I think they kept things simple andmovie was a little slow, but it recover at the end. Liked the plot asit was exciting and interesting, not like every other movie, they keepon edge until the end. Brad Pitt delivered an excellent performance andMarion Cotillard, somehow I couldn't believe her entirely, but was goodas well.
