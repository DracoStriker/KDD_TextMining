The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3Dsex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up andleft. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meanderingstroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well.The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead,favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again andagain and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers againand again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to pleasethem and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's aresplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.You hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside inhalflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what thisfilm surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that withit's magnificent camera-work and editing.But what would this review be if it didn't talk about the 3D sex? Loveand cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to achair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films usedto cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows.Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, Noé takes thataway which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing ("finally alove story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warningin the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved andI encourage viewers to look beyond.
