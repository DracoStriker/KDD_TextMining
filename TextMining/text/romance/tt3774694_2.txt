No one was able to walk out of the theater this evening as the directorGaspar Noe was in the audience. I'm certain he took note of folkslaughing at scenes meant to have profound emotional impact, like theentire ending. Little character development with the main character's 17 yr old wife,or 18, they had sex when she was 16, nothing more than a prop. Theirchild, the unintended creation of a broken condom, is named "Gaspar".The wife is an orphan of sorts, unwanted by her mother but somehow hasthe cash and wherewithall to rent an apt in Paris and do nothing morethan go clubbing, listen to her iPod and bang strangers. Profoundly self-indulgent about lost love, but hard to take seriouslywhen the lost love happens between supposed college students (we neversee the college, college books or a single classmate) living andpartying in Paris, none of whom even are even remotely worth caringabout. Except perhaps the teenage wife, after she gives birth, butagain her only role is to get banged, have a kid and though otherwiseabsolutely gorgeous, kind and loving as only a supermodel with minimallines can be, this one only serves to annoy the hell out of the maincharacter. Reminded me of Brown Bunny, but that was a film with guts. This is justan excuse to film cumshots in 3D, wrapped around a plot that never wentanywhere with no sense of finality or a hint of revelation orcompletion. In fact, the movie had to flash a massive THE END for theaudience to know the film was over.
