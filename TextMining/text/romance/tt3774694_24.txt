Well the movie is really different, i felt sad for the main malecharacter with his behavior, the sex scenes are really strong but notfrom another world, I was not horny, in any sex scene, i just seetrying to understand the director point of view, and i hope i didunderstand this...natural,humans,sex,internet,porn,bisexual and a lotof other things that is happening and will happen in the future, iliked the movie and I did not like, i am giving 7 because the directordid a really great job to express the reality of the movielove,behavior,choices and sex. Excellent cinematography, averageperformance / odd of the actors, good soundtrackof course. My Opinion i am not the master of cinema, but i don'tundestard why credential critics give so many bad talk of this movie, iam sure some of they watched/watch porn and/or do sex.
