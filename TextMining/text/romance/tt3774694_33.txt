This might be the only movie that shows real intimacy and real love onthe screen.It felt like being in someone, listening to him talk to himself. Justlike I talk to myself. It felt very satisfying seeing the world troughsomeone else's eyes. It was very easy to not judge him because i becamethe head character. I feel it, the feeling of new-love as we say in Sweden. That strongfeeling stayed inside me throughout the evening after watching this.That exact feeling you have when everything is crazy and your feelingsare so strong. When you can move mountains with the love that fills upyour chest. That anything is possible if you just have that otherperson by your side. And the sex is a very big part of telling thisstory truthfully.
