This was from the director of 'Irreversible'. This story was told inbackwards. It opened with a married couple having sexual intercourseand after a phone call, the flashback rolls. Which begins from thatpoint of the story where it stands to where it all began as per thefilm character who recalls all the events. Actually, it was impressiveidea, not that reverse way storytelling, but how the characters weredrawn. And then the story was very simple, like the film '9½ Weeks',the drama and the sex parts shared the remaining narrationalternatively for like every 10-15 minutes.I wanted to like it, but not convinced with the blend between both thedrama and sex scenes. They should have developed and blended themtogether better. Especially since the storytelling was reversified, oneof the major plot holes is not solved or revealing what could havehappened to that particular character on which this plot was developed.If you are not concerned about the storyline and looking for adultcontents as in a film, not as a better porn film, then you might enjoyit.The other major issue was the length. Two hours long for an adult filmmeans teasing and testing your patience. It should have been under 90minutes, that would have speeded it up a bit. The actors were decent.The film poster was so hot, it will drag you to watch this film. But Iwould say not to expect big, either adult stuffs or from the dramaticsegments. Within its frame, it delivered, but for me it was an averageand a little below.4.5/10
