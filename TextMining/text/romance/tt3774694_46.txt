To me this film was about two tortured souls that didn't know how tolove and used sex as a means to explore love.This is porn though. Yes, it even has a money shot. Those in the know,know what that means and yes very graphic. The penetration scenes don'tseem to be real but the other kinds of sex acts are certainly real.It's male performers and star Karl Glusman, all have full erections.There is oral sex as well.Sadly it's not good full-feature erotica. The characters are all twodimensional and Murphy is a slut of a man that thinks he knows whatlove is, but can't curb his lust for other women and sex.The characters simply were not well-rounded and the film is entirelytoo long and I think that if it were more linear, it would have workedbetter. Furthermore if the film is going to have a lot of actual sex orsex acts, the director should have experimented and explored more. It'smissionary, doggy style and spooning. At least be more creative.You want sexy characters to help get into the sex, regardless of theplot and talent helps. Invest in some actual porn stars.If you want to see how explicit it is watch the first half. However, itis not worth watching past that point.
