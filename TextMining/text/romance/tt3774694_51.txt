Both effective and affecting, Gaspar Noe's "Love" (2015 France) willmake you FEEL... intensely, albeit emotionally ambiguous, at times.This is a sensual (not suitable, at all, for young audiences),heartbreaking, histrionic piece, the final minutes, of which, havehaunted me/saddened me/enlightened me throughout today. Critics andmost audiences will not accept or understand this film (read: whichmeans it's good), but I think this is honest, visually-succinct/dreamy, brave, and aware filmmaking. There are no ruleshere... socially or personally. I actually woke up today with the finalline of this picture wooing me awake... and it kind of hurt, in alife-affirming way. Excellent film.
