The way they put these deep feelings of love and intense relationshipon the screen, is very well done. I can very much relate to a big partof the story. There were maybe too many sex scenes but actually, mostof them were very real to me. There could have maybe some more detailsof the individuals' life (school, work, friends), but at the same timeit keeps very much focused on the intensity of the couplesrelationship, which makes you live their story together with them. Thefilm could have been a bit shorter (cut some sex scenes). But overall,it's a very moving film, it will stay with me for a while. A kind oflove like this one is real (I confirm for all the haters out there)!
