I believe that I have seen all of Noe's films,so who can actually saythat watching his films is ever a 'pleasant'experience.Quitefrankly,they all make me squirm at some point.'Love' is noexception,just different subject matter.As I said before,I don't reallyenjoy watching his films,but they all have an affect on me,and that'sthe true test of what is art,and what is not.In a culture where thevast majority of our 'entertainment'is so bland,and unchallenging,Iappreciate art that makes me uncomfortable.It opens my mind andactually makes me think about what I'm experiencing.It's easy to slagoff Gasper Noe,but honestly how many filmmakers today make films thatmake you go hmmm,that was rather disturbing.That's how David Lynch madeall of his films and he's legendary.
