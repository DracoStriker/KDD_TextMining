After the movie goes on for a long time, Murphy says he want to make amovie about love & sex and its intensity when both are combined. Laterone I thought to myself that the movie does exactly that, but had itnot being pointed out to me directly, I would have thought of the moviea lot more. Also at a few points during the movie when I thought thesex scene was long, I looked around and like the photography; have Inot pieced together that the protagonist is self-serving, I would havetaken it a lot more in consideration of my appreciation.Also what was the point of showing the swinger/orgy place? Is it toshow they reconciled each other for their cheating and now are open?Was it necessary to take so long to make that point? I like seeing realsex in a movie. They took it to a new level, although not from afar asShortbus was pretty filled with sex. I think I just figured out why theorgy place chapter...I like a lot the tension between the 2 lovers, but writing this I'mrealizing the protagonist is missing her so much but he haven't beenthis way all along, it's only because he got news of her.
