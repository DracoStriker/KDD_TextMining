Yesterday I finally decided to watch Love. It is a film that is best towatch alone and I think it is because of self-examination. Throughout,it had me thinking about my own feelings on the subject of trueintimacy. Yes, there are explicit sex scenes in the film although to meit wasn't constantly. I was willing to see beyond that. As I watched, Iwondered about censorship in regards to nudity and sex in film. I amnot appalled by nudity or sex. I understand that it gets laughed offbecause of being something so private and it is, but I never thought ofit as remotely funny. I admire artists who reveal something that is sopersonal through their work. From what I know of Gaspar Noe, there weresome similarities between him and the main character Murphy but themovie isn't autobiographical. Throughout the film he often ruminates onthe true love of his life Electra. That's it, but it is beautifullyfilmed and played out. It's relaxing to watch. It helps that Murphy whois played by Karl Glusman is quite attractive, so at the same time Iwas admiring his body. I thought his character was a bit reckless. Iwanted to see it in 3d and there are scenes when it would be effective,such as when a guy is pointing his finger directly to your point ofview. Ultimately though I think the 3d effect would have been only anovelty as in all 3d movies. Viewing it in 2d doesn't take anythingaway from it. While I wasn't expecting an Irreversible Part II, Inoticed Gaspar Noe certainly has mellowed since then although itdoesn't mean what he does now is of unsatisfactory value. His work ispresented in a more stable way and is a bit differently as well.
