Distressed and guilt-ridden upon learning that his former girlfriendhas mysteriously vanished, an aspiring filmmaker loses himself in hisfaded memories in this characteristically graphic motion pictureexperience from the mind of Gaspar Noé. With his thoughts narratedaloud and intimate camera-work that constantly follows the protagonistaround, the film captures the upset young man's stream of consciousnesswell. The non-linear nature of his flashbacks comes also across as anaccurate reflection of the recollection process. Clocking in at nearlytwo and a half hours long though, the film runs incredibly long for amovie with such a relatively simple premise and bits and pieces growrepetitive quite quickly. Oddly enough, it is the sexually chargedscenes that feel the most repetitive despite Noé constantly upping theante with how explicit the scenes are; on the other hand, it is logicalthat the dialogue-heavy scenes come off better since those are the onesin which we actually see the characters interacting and learnprogressively more about them. In fact, the bigger question is probablywhy the protagonist so often thinks of copulation when remembering hisex-girlfriend; are these the moments when he felt most intimate withher, and if they are, is he confusing love with lust? It is surely foodfor thought. Whatever the case, 'Love' leaves an indelible impressionthat is hard to shake. It is not as immersing and overwhelming anexperience as 'Enter the Void', but it does a fairly decent job ofhandling a similarly dreamy narrative structure in which time seems toblur.
