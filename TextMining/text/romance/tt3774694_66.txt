Love is the 4th feature film by Gaspar Noé. His last one 'Enter theVoid' came out 6 years ago. As you can tell by the poster Gaspar doesnot make films for a general audience as they are mostly offensive,brutal and to a certain degree shocking (but that might beunderestimating the jaded audience who these days have access toanything on the internet and as such are not easily shocked). Lovemight actually be his most accessible film as there is no violence butplenty of nudity and sex. Actually it's quite explicit, in the sensethat the difference between real porn and this film is that 'Love' hasa lot better lighting and cinematography. Now having plenty of sexscenes doesn't make it a good film. I found it rather boring actuallyand watched it 3 parts because it could not keep my attention. The filmgoes a bit like this: sex scene / fight scene (vocally, not physical) /make-up sex scene / nag scene / more sex / more nagging...you get thepicture, this goes on for about 129 mins. That can get pretty tiresome.Gaspar's idea is that he wants a 'romantic' film where you also get tosee the lovemaking and as we are all adults we should see it. But thatin itself doesn't make this movie better. Certainly not if yourcharacters are really not that likable. So my recommendation: see it ifyou are a real die hard Noé fan but otherwise skip it, there are lotsof better movies released in 2015.
