About 20 minutes in the movie I was already annoyed by this movie andchecked how much time was left. I did survive until the end, althoughsometimes it was questionable why am I torturing myself. I still wantedto know what was there to show in the remaining hour and 40 minutes.Sex scenes were the only good thing about the movie, everything elsewas pretty miserable and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I supportthe thought that threesome often ruins relationships. One should havethat with a total stranger on a vacation - no names, no contacts, nostrings. If you have nothing better to do then watch it, but mysuggestion would be to watch the sex scenes and then make love yourselfmeanwhile.
