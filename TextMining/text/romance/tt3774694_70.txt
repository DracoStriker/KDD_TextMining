"If you fall in love," says Murphy "you are a loser." Only part of himbelieves this. The other part stalks Electra anywhere she goes. She isthe source of both intense passion and pain for Murphy. Into the nightclubs of Paris with their pulsing lights and vibrant colors, alleys,subways, bedrooms and showers (especially these last two), we followthe young couple. The film moves back and forth in time and is aboutthe joy and sadness of being in love. Love is intimate in two senses ofword. In one sense the sex is raw and explicit (3D explicit) and in thesecond sense the film really puts viewers into the scenes. It is as ifwe are really involved in the film. This is the characteristic style ofthe director. It is bold, stylish, playful, intense, non-linear andextremely passionate. Noe makes appearances in many of the scenes inone form or another (when Murphy named his kid "Gaspar," many in theaudience chuckled). Even the ending credits are stylish in terms ofvisuals and sound, and you can't stop watching even that. Noe reallyhas the ability and courage to show such lushness in emotions andscenery. The cinematography is not as good as Enter the Void, nor isthe acting, yet it isn't too far removed. Five of five stars. Seen atthe Toronto International Film Festival 2015.
