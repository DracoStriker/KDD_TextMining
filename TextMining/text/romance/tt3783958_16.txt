I went to this film with the expectation that I would be seeing a'modern musical with a nostalgic twist'. This expectation was delivered but generally in a mediocre way. The much touted opening number was a technically accomplishedcinematographic feat but the setting and choreography was rather blandand boring (I struggled to hear and care about the song for thisnumber).I found the 'repartee' between the two leads was a bit mumbled and notparticularly witty or fun. The dancing was very average and the songs and singing unmemorable (Miaand Seb's theme was bland and not what you would expect a jazzenthusiast to come up with). Apart from the two leads, there were no other memorable characters orperformances.There was never a moment when I felt joy watching any of the scenes,which I suppose was the reason why I was most disappointed with thefilm.A few interesting LA landmarks were showcased in the film but, again,the interesting settings were not really exploited by the choreography.For example, Mia and/or Seb could have danced on the round balcony atthe observatory (what you would have expected a Fred or Gene to havedone). If this was not allowed on the real balcony, the balcony couldhave been re-created on a set.Ryan Gosling did not convey any great passion for either jazz or Mia,most of his facial expressions made it seem that he was a martyr tomild indigestion. He spoke a lot about his passions but you need toshow this cinematically.I enjoyed Emma Stone's performance much more. Some of her auditionscenes were good and her performance of her last audition song was good(I thought the song itself was just OK).To summarize, one of the few films that I was tempted to walk out on(but I was in the middle of a row), and one that I will never betempted to watch again.
