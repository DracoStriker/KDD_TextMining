A film that fails the Turing test - in reverse. Or something. What Imean is that after the first 5 minutes the unpleasant sensation crawledover me that I was participating in a rather sinister experiment,watching a movie made by a computer which was testing me by attemptingto provoke a human-like response. Stuffed with algorithms culled fromproper movies and musicals, the computer has generated a script and aset of scenarios based on user-preference and targeted directly at myvery own demographic! Its eerie; the songs sound like songs but aren'tquite, the dialogue sounds like people but not quite, nothing thathappens has a real reason or point other than to crank through theplot, the jazz looks like jazz and sounds like jazz but isn't, quite,and the set-ups calculated to provoke an emotional effect left meuntouched and feeling slightly hollow. What has been thrown, hurled andheaved at this film is Oscar-seeking acting, Oscar-seeking directionand Oscar-seeking technical twiddling. And hey ho and guess what, itgot Oscars. Its the apotheosis of junk food, finally. You don't evenneed to make the effort to chew; it can now just squirt directly intoyou via the eyes and ears, a simulacrum of nourishment, over-flavouredglop taking the name of real love, real music, real acting and reallife in vain.
