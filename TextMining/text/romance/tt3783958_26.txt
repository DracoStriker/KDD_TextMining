What a great movie! Who would have thought anyone could bring theoriginal screen musical back from the dead? Yet here it is, hale andhearty.The music is melodic but never simplistic; the lyrics are intelligentand intelligible; the script is funny, touching without ever resortingto sentimentality; the two leads are not only skillful but full of akind of charm that I honestly thought had disappeared entirely fromAmerican movies: but here we have Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone justoozing it.The only pebbles in this ocean of inventiveness are some routine danceroutines and over-reliance on the device of lights dimming on set toisolate an actor in white light, but that's me being r-e-a-l-l-y picky.It may well be that this is the best musical written directly for thescreen since SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.All credit to writer-director Damien Chazelle and his team - and itreally feels like a team-movie - for giving us this gem. Sure it's afeelgood piece, but it creates a world which is complex, itacknowledges alternative outcomes for its characters, it connects withpeople's passions, and in the case of Ms Stone's big solo, "Audition",it has a bona fide classic.
