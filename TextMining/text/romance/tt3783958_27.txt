Words fail me. I can only assume that the lovers of this film havelittle past experience watching quality musicals, romances, orcomedies. Who the hell thought this mess up? What were they sniffing?The scene where the two stars suddenly fly into the stratosphere in amovie theater was laughable, silly, and ridiculous. Our movie nightwith friends turned into groans and unintended laughter at itsstupidity. To add insult to injury, the split second cuts from scene toscene added an amateurish touch to the whole affair. After an hour, wecouldn't take anymore and shut it off in disgust. If you want misery,get a root canal instead. It would be much easier to endure.It's sad that a whole generation of movie goers will accept thisgarbage as a good movie. Obviously they've never seen very many "good"movies.But look on the bright side. Seventh grade girls will really love thiscrock.
