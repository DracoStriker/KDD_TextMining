Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone prance about the stage for two mind-numbinghours, presumably searching for some plot and characterisation. I can'teven recall what the characters were called, but they may as well havejust been 'Ryan' and 'Emma', for that is all they were. It was anutterly tedious, unengaging experience and devoid of any quality orsubstance. I gave up after an hour. Against my better judgement I watched the rest the next day. However, Imay as well have been watching Shark Attack 7 or some nonsense likethat, for I just could not be bothered even looking at the TV. Thesinging and dancing did little for me, with two leads not very adept ateither. I derived absolutely nothing from this entirely vacuousexperience. I really do not understand what the point of this was.1/10
