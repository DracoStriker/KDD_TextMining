A old couple left 30 minutes in. I couldn't understand the music, Icouldn't hear the lyrics. Ryan Gosling's character was a dick for 90%of the movie. He is a good actor, but my goodness his character is anass hat. The story to me was blah. It was like I've see this story toldbefore just differently. Emma Stone is amazing. I definitely enjoyedher more than Ryan's character, but that honestly isn't too hard. Themovie seemed pretentious and over rated as a whole. It was justHollywood getting off on Hollywood. Imagine if Hollywood was a personand cloned themselves. Then Hollywood starts sucking Hollywoods dick.There, that's most of the story. White man tries to save jazz. I did enjoy the visuals, editing, colours and dancing. So it was niceto look at, I'll give it that. But the story to me was under whelming.
