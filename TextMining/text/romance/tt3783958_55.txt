I must be from another planet! This film which did so well at therecent Oscars, made me painfully aware that my taste is much differentfrom those who gave it such a good rating.I like musicals, but found this not to be one. What story was there tosee? I watched the movie on disc and found the dancing in the trafficjam at the start, a load of rubbish and hurtful to watch. I battled onwatching, but after almost half an hour, scanned through to the end.The flashing picture before my eyes, was no different when watching themovie! The same scenes over and over again.If the movie had anything in its favor, I missed this completely. Ohwell, I saved about 2 hours of pain. Thanks goodness I am still saneafter this experience. I give it a rating of 2, because of not havingseen the movie at normal speed, otherwise it would probably be a 1.
