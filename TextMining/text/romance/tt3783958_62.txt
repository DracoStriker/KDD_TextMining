Can not understand how someone who is not a 6 year old can find thismovie interesting. A waste of time and money for any adult, male orfemale. All people I spoke to were very disappointed. Poor story, poorexecution. Acting was OK. Dancing was OK. But this is the 21st century,Hollywood can do better. much better. this may have been considered agood movie 30-50 years ago. not today. Not even 1 element in the moviethat is new, that brings to life a new point of view, that hasn't beentreated before, in a better manner, in so many movies. Nothing thatmakes you wonder or dream. I am trying to think of a good wordregarding the movie... maybe the acting, which was OK. that's it.
