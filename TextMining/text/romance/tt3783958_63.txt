I'll never get those two hours back or my money! I should have readfurther into the reviews on here before wasting my time. This isnothing like I expected. I truly don't understand all the hype thismovie has received and how it's winning so many awards. The acting &dancing is not very good and their singing leaves a lot to be desired.I've seen better singing & dancing on The Muppet Show! I thought therewould be lots of visuals of LA but no, pretty much studio lot andapartment scenes. I was so disappointed!Please don't waste your time on this movie! Just go out to eat andspend your money on a good meal!
