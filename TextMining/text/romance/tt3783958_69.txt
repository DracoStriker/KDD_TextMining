I wouldn't say I tricked into seeing this but I had no idea beforegoing that the film would be a nonsensical forgettable throwback stylemusical that was clearly written for the demographic mindset of 40+year old single women with three wine coolers in them. It was clearthat the story, supposedly about Jazz or Theater or something, wasaimed at pasty White people who don't know the first thing about Jazzor Theater. Mix in a lot of forced chemistry-free smiling, brutallycrafted ideas for singing and dancing, and a couple of out-of-place 'f'words to make it seem that this is supposed to also be a film foradults and you have a recipe for a bloated overrated piece of glitteryjunk that looks more like a thrift store basket filled with cheapdeceased people's jewelry than the most amazing film in decades. I keptwaiting for Mary Poppins style cartoon birds or penguins to show up.Get over yourself if think this was any better than the awful'Chicago', which by the way was just as forgettable although itstupidly won an Oscar and beat out several much better films. Thedumbest film I have seen in years. Thanks for the nap.
