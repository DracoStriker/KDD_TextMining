I gave this movie a 3/10 in an effort of making it have an appropriateoverall rating. The movie lacks good singing, dancing and script.Contrary to most musicals, it has no real memorable scene that definesthe movie. Main actors do a great acting job, but their additional skills (dancing& singing) are sub-par. In my opinion, if you like musicals don't expect much from this moviewhich I would believe should have a 6/10 overall. If you've never seenmany musicals this movie might be refreshing, if it is follow it up bywatching the top rated musicals here in IMDb like Singin in the Rain,Mary Poppins, Sound of Music, American in Paris, etc.
