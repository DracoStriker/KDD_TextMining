...and i wish i did the same.This was nothing. A movie designed to please the academy awardscommittee in a self glorifying tribute to themselves. A remembrance tothe movies they used to make (and watch) in "the good ol days".. ByHollywood, for Hollywood.There was no story. I was waiting for the movie to start. I wanted toleave SO bad, but i didn't want to ruin the experience for the otherpeople i went to the Cinema with...turns out they were all doing thesame thing. And when we left the the cinema, i heard people saying it'sthe most boring piece of crap they had seen in a long while. I'm not abuffoon, honestly, i like a good musical. I grew up watching FredAstaire movies with my grandma. This was not that. This movie is livingon a hype. Don't buy in to it. Oh and if you kinda went "oh...ehm...wtf?" in the flying scene, you'renot alone.
