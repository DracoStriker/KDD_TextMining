Is the rating too high on this site for this movie or what???All the hype and nominations for this horrible movie reminds me of how98% of the media reports from a liberal point of view instead of from anon-partisan point of view. Disgusting.This movie lacks everything from acting to so called singing. Horribleis what should be the headlines for this atrocity!We had to force ourselves to watch this till the end. Several times wewere on the verge of shutting it off. This proves that the Oscar'sshould be abolished. And who really cares if an Iranian actress doesn'tgo to the Oscar's? And how long have you lived in a freecountry...NEVER! (lol)?Poor Ryan Gosling, I always liked him.....disappointing that he chosesuch a flop to "act" in. Thought he didn't want to do the Hollywoodthing anymore. Proves Hollywood money can buy anything or anyone.
