The most magical cinematic experience I've ever had in my life. It'ssimply perfect, and I wished I would've have seen it more than twice intheaters. The colors are just simply gorgeous and it's meaning aboutdreams is so inspiring, yet depressing. It hurts me when I see peoplegive this negative reviews. I adore this film, and it's everlastingimpact on me.
