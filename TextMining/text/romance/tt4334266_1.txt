This is another film that screams "I want to be a cult movie!" but justdoesn't have what it takes. It starts out promising and then seems tohave absolutely nowhere to go; it just becomes long, ponderous andself-indulgent. As someone who grew up going to midnight movies, "TheBad Batch" seems like its taken elements from these films ("El Topo,""Mad Max," "Kill Bill") and stitched them all together in the hopesit'll hit the mark somewhere. The performances in the film areadequate, but nothing in the script really demands much of thecharacters. Ms. Amirpour obviously had the support of actors like DiegoLuna, Jim Carrey and Keanu Reeves, all of whom are seen briefly, butI'm willing to bet they never saw much of a script. At two hours,there's probably half an hour of real material here, the rest justfeels like padding.
