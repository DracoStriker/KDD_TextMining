The Bad Batch is like an art-house version of Mad Max. It's in adystopian future, has these strange groups of people in the deserts andstuff, it's gory at times...just without dynamics. But hey, you can'treally expect an art-house film to be dynamic.This is a beautiful, beautiful looking movie. Seriously, this thing isgorgeously shot and sucks you into this world. But the story fails atsucking you in. It's obviously open to interpretation at times, butwhen you take it literally, it's really not much of a plot. It hasthese moments, surprising moments of an actual conversation that seemsto set up some themes, but then it's like nothing ever happened. Onlyif you dig deep enough, but it's not that interesting. I came up with afew theories about metaphors in this movie, so it did interest me abit, but I really didn't feel like going into details. Aside from thescript, everything worked for me. The style, the acting, the pace (eventhough it's a bit sleazy, I sort of expected that). The director knowshow to awaken some emotions with just directing actors and putting usin their head through some scenes.I might watch this again. If you want another strange movie to analyze,this is for you. It's not the best, but it's alright.
