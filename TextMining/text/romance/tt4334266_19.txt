This film tells the story of a young woman who is captured byCannibalistic tribe in the desert. I cannot believe how bad this film is. The first word is spoken at thetwenty minute Mark. The film is constantly provides close ups ofamputees, so much that it almost feels like it's a fetishistic thing.There is almost no story, and the only so called story is just toprovide reasons for more amputation. The film is beyond terrible. Idon't know how it attracted three big actors.
