Truly dire movie. The first 10 mins are shocking and quite gripping,but after that it loses the plot - only that there is no plot to lose.Seriously, there is nothing in terms of a story. Instead, there areaimless wonderings around the dessert by characters, and long, longshots, and long scenes where very little actually happens. There is noproper dialogue to speak of, and the one conversation that the film hasis about sh*t....literally it's about sh*t. How? Why? What was thepurpose of this movie? How did anyone actually think this would be agood idea?The only good thing, is the main actress, who is quite cute andwatchable.
