Dark Comedy! Too bad Kubrick isn't around for this one. What can yousay maybe impermanence meets survival.I have seen many movies with a much larger body count, more blood andgore but this is art and art makes you squirm or at least it should.This will become a cult classic along with Night of the Living Dead.Someone needs to put a plaque where this one was made. Good Work Justwatch and listen. No right and no wrong there is just life as is
