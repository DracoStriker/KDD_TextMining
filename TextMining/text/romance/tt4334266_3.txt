This is a dystopian movie about a young woman left out in a lawlessdesert with some real choice characters. This film starts off very brutally but calms down considerably afterthe first few scenes.The characters, acting, production and filming are really good. Thestory is adequate for needs. The scenery and leading lady areabsolutely gorgeous.So why the low score? The pace of this film is cripplingly slow. Thereare tedious scenes that should be time lapsed but are run in real time,there is lots of staring and grimacing in silence. You really can goand make yourself a sandwich during this and be safe in the knowledgethat you are unlikely to miss anything.A lot of potential, I really wanted to like this, but it is just soslow I was fighting to stay awake.
