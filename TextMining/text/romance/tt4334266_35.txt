So many issues here. Apparently you can wander around in the desert forhours (days?) and not even get a touch of sunburn (literally the firstline in the movie is 'It's hotter than Satan's a-hole out here'), yetno sunburn. Or ride motorcycles in the desert with no eye protection and not evensquint in the closeup.Then there's the Muscle Beach Cannibal Compound (I thought the moviehad gone to commercial when the scene started, it's so silly and out ofplace).Could have been a decent flick. Does not deliver.
