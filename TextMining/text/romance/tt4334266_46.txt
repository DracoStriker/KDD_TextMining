The negative reviews of this indulgent, self-important drudgery of afilm are all accurate. Don't waste your time watching this even forfree. Unsympathetic characters acted badly in a visually statichellhole are add up to nothing.Save your attention and precious time for something more worthwhile,like re watching the latest Mad Max film. Now that's genius.
