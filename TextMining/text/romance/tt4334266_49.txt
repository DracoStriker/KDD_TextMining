Excellent sound track to this mostly non violent dystopian tale of agirl out of place amongst the out of place. Fans of the genre who enjoya break from standard box office type fair should enjoy this film, thouit may disappoint some. Defiantly a movie you must see for yourself todecide. Avoid if you expect an action packed blood thirsty movie.With almost a touch of misanthropy Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) navigatesher way around a sparsely populated desert type area after anunfortunate event. We are not quite sure if she wants love or revenge.Keep your eyes peeled for Jim Carrey if you can recognize him.
