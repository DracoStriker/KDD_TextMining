I tried to like this movie in Netflix. I stopped it.. washed the dog...returned...nope, still bad. Two cups of coffee did not improve it, Ifound myself surfing in Facebook while movie was playing and sometimeslooked at it to see where the wandering girl with fake fake leg is. I'mthe kind of person who eats gummy bears in pairs just so one does notdie alone... this movie caused the unnecessary deaths of countlessgummy bears! Oh my.... Carnivale (series) this is not! The plot is soweak and the story? so linear. Girl walks around in desert, no sex, armn leg cut off, more walking, movie ends. I gave it a 2 because thefilming was good in wide screen :)
