Movie offers an interesting survival state setting with a veryAESTHETIC perception of it. But you can't expect me to be interested init for 2 hours just because there is a good looking young female headactress and a human flesh eating Havana body builder. Bad Batch has no meaningful story or dialogue what so ever all tho itgives us glimpses of semi interesting characters and groups. Just showsthe mindlessness of the writer, movie is just a one big boring lump ofteasing.
