The pace of the movie is very slow and that is why i think most peopledidn't like it.I personally enjoyed it, it's tense, original and strange in its ownstyle.You don't get a satisfying payback from the story, but once againArmipour puts her unique style over substance and delivers well enoughone more time. In a post apocalyptic genre which is already veryexplored in cinema, it was original enough for me.Slow paced but intriguing movie with some famous and almostunrecognizable actors.
