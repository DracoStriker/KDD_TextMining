I'm not even going to bother talking about the supposed story here, asthere was none. I just want to point out that not once did I feelinterested in any visual, any actor nor did I care one bit about thelead character which was a girl in an impossible place for a female inthe real world (she would have been killed/raped long ago) so the wholemovie is just ridiculous, boring, for lack of a better term, andEXTREMELY pretentious film-making and editing. Someone else said it's"trying desperately to be cool" and it fails 100%
