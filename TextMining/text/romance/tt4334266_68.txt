There are 4 big name actors in this movie first off Jim Carey who backin the 90 along Tommy Lee Jones where big, they where everywhere andthey won pretty much everything and now he is reduced to playing smallpart in movies like this what happen to him? Keanu Reeves ? the matrixspeed John Wick what are you doing in this? honestly.........Jason Momoa conan aquaman but he is known for doing a few awful bmovies i guess a paycheck is a paycheck still he is super fit in thismovie an inspiration for me at 45.Diego Luna starting to make a name for himself star wars rogue one,elysium but man what where you thinking taking a role in this awfulmovie.There is almost no dialogue in this movie, if it was handled correctlyit could have been great, a good story and script.The base story was a great ideal poorly executed. Its walking and morewalking useless talk then more walking and so on.... it makes no senseat all.Skip this one even arrow in the head gave it a 3 so you know its bad.
