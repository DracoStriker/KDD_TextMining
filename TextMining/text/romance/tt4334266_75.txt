Whoever wrote this script I am 100 positive is in a bad relationship ..right now. You know the kind of bad relationship where you family hasto have an intervention. So this movie was weird but not good weird butbad weird. Multiple unexplained plot lines. I guess we are supposed toread the screenwriters mind. I have more questions than answers afterthe credits role. Matter of fact who wrote this. If I did someone likewhat he did to her what he did to ...smh and then .. really. I thoughtthis movie was going to good since I saw Aquaman in the trailer.Aquaman in this movie suck. What's up with that horrible accent also.Oh, you have been quiet the whole movie now you want spaghetti. Warningthis movie is pointless
