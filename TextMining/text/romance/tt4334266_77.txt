I don't really know how to describe this movie, despite the synopsismentioning cannibals I knew not to expect an Eli Roth film. I wassurprised to see Suki Waterhouse as the lead as I wasn't aware she hadestablished herself as a leading actress, but to my surprise I reallyliked her in this movie. She's in virtually every scene, and she holdsher own. Admittedly I sought this movie out primarily because I'm ahuge Keanu Reeves fan, and will essentially watch anything he's in, andsure he's in it...but not very much. There are many other famous facestoo although you'd be hard pressed to recognize some...Jim Carrey,Diego Luna, Giovanni Ribisi, and not to forget Jason Mamoa (you can'tmiss him in this movie). Despite the cue of a cast...nothing muchhappens...a lot of filming of people in the desert, wind in hair, longuncut scenes with very little dialogue. Essentially a slow film, thesoundtrack is what propels you through, and simply wanting to see howthe story resolves.Not the worst 2 hours of my life...but probably won't watch again, norwould I really recommend it to others, unless you're a die hard Keanucompletest like I am.
