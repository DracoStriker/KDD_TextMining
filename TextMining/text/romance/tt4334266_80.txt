It was sad to see a great idea turned into a bad movie. Sexist, racistand, definitely, not a romantic movie. If you're going to show peoplefrom Spanish speaking countries, please hire Spanish speaking people.I'm bored with Latin equal bad versus U.S. equals good... orequivalents. Women equals weak vs men equals strong and protective.(spoiler) Multiple wives???? Come on!!! I really loved the backgroundof the movie and the sci-fi idea... but terrible performance.
