It turns into a Mad Max-like love story. Brutal at times, but verysensitive in an animalistic way. About an hour in, there's a fantastichallucinogenic/tripping scene, great technical film work. As an aside,you aren't likely to pick Jim Carrey out of the end-times crowd. KeanuReeves has a great part later in the story, a role that made me thinkabout Hugh Hefner's place in humanity. Thumbs up!
