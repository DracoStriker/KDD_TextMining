Her: "I like mysterious, but I'm scared cause I'm fragile." Him: "Don't be afraid, I'm the one who is afraid... of hurting you." *Have Some Sex* Her: "You're so thoughtful, maybe I misjudged you. Now I want to behurt... just not emotionally." Him: "I always hurt people, but I would never hurt you... unless youwanted me to." Her: "Ouch, you hurt me. Now my feelings are hurt and I'm sad and mywhole life hurts." Him: "I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'll try harder, but I don't think I'llever change.'Her: "I'm gonna pretend like I didn't hear that, but please don't hurtme again. I trust you to change for me- projects are fun." Him: "Put these things in your ass." Her: "No." Him: "Okay, I'm not good with people because I'mmysterious." *Have Some Sex Again* Aaaand Credits
