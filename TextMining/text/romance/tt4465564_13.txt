To begin with, I believe the second part was 1 pct better than theprevious one. The acting was awful in this part too, same goes for thestory. Females find this movie kind of attractive, well some of them.This may be a result of their hidden, unfulfilled desires or something,something that we, mortals, can't understand...b*lls**t in one word.When the expectations are so high, u don't come up with a movie likethis with such poverty regarding actors, scenes, intrigue etc. Theparody of the first part was better by far and that was a bad, very badmovie. Can't wait for the second part parody, bad as the previous ofcbut better than FSD for sure.P.S. If a girl gets beaten hard, cruelly (regarding same methods shownin this "masterpiece") by some ordinary dude, that is called violencebut if a girl gets beaten by a multimillionaire dude, that's love!I suppose I've said it all. Ta-daaaaa
