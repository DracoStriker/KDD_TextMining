While not having particularly high expectations, it must be said, I didgo into this film with an open mind. However only a few minutes in andI already felt the urge to leave and fill my brain with something lessawful and mind rotting.It's not just the non-existent plot and hammy acting that let this filmdown, although they were major factors, the chemistry between the twoleads was like watching two planks of wood getting together. None ofwhat I saw made me believe he was an irresistible sex god with a darkside. And with Ana, let's just say biting ones lip every time somethingis suggested gets a bit old.Furthermore, without wanting to spoil, is her IQ supposed to be about50? I have to ask because she pretty much agrees to everything he says,and not in a dom/sub kind of way, more just because she doesn't seem tohave the mental ability to argue. You have to wonder how she's employedin the first place.I've seen some absolutely dire films but I can honestly say this is theworst film I've ever seen.
