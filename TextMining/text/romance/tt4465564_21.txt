This was a terrible movie. Extremely boring and senseless. Do not wasteyour time to watch this garbage. Not even romantic. Even the sex wasvery stupid and dull. Even the acting was really terrible. The storyline is very stupid. The only good thing about the movie is Seattlescenery. Reminds me of San Francisco.
