Well ..... (if you haven't yet seen it but intend to, best to look awaynow). Might I say that the romance between Jack & Rose, in "Titanic"(1997), was FAR MORE CAPTIVATING, than this 2nd installment of the"Fifty Shades" franchise. According to an IMDb peer reviewer, thismovie actually went nowhere. "This movie is awful, yes, that's the bestway to describe this movie. Acting, terrible, the story does not makesense. It's just about sex, and a bad, really poorly written script"(you're better of just watching reruns of soap operas, such as the "TheBold & the Beautiful (1987-)"/ "Days of our lives" (1965-), or even"Passions" (1999-2007) for free on the telly. "The soundtrack stoodout, and the cinematography is decent. But once again, its a filmbaiting TEENAGE GIRLS, to go watch (soft porn) in the movie theater (asecond time around"). Its just a shame that the lead couple (DakotaJohnson, "Anastasia Steele", and Jamie Dornan, "Christian Grey") werehanded such a boring script (I'm looking at you, Mr Niall Leonard. Idon't care if you're married to the author of the books). No characterdevelopment. And a really dull plot. No twists. No suspense. Viewershave had better sex elsewhere. Finally, KIM BASINGER: HOW DARE SHE BECAST IN SUCH A TERRIBLE ROLE !! She was Hollywood's DARLING of the1980s/1990s !! Batman's box office love interest !! I don't care howmuch she's aged !! Quite disrespectful, in casting her as an"undesirable" (same deal with Bella Heathcote - just so terriblyunderused). Instead of providing a rating, I'll propose a moreappropriate title: "FIFTY SHADES 2: THE VIRTUE, OR IGNORANCE OF RICHPEOPLE AGONIZING OVER LIPSTICK MARKS ON THEIR CHEST". Plus the filmwould've worked (much, much better) as a comedy. Think Tommy Wiseau's"The Room" (2006). I'm actually not joking about this. P.S: Thank youto my mate Chris for coming to watch this travesty with me. We survivedit, bro. High Five.
