The first movie was boring and very poorly made, so I didn't expectanything from this either. Actually this was the first time I went tothe movie theater knowing that the movie I'm going to see is going tobe terrible. I just wanted to see, if it is possible to make worsemovie than what the first one was. (I did like the books. I think theywere entertaining, when you don't take them too seriously.)Jamie Dornan is great looking guy, but he just has no clue, what kindof character Christian Grey is. Dornan's acting was so clumsy that itwas awkward. When he was supposed to be angry and furious to Ana and heshouted "Where the f**k have you been", it was hysterical. I mean,there was no character or anger in his voice or body language, and itfelt like he had never used the f-word before. It was like he wasreading the script, but had no idea what else he was supposed to do. And Dornan hasn't obviously never slapped someone on the butt, becausethat scene, where he was spanking Anastasia, was so awkward that Idon't even have words for it. So basically the whole movie was off and unrealistic and not in a goodway. And because it was so terrible, the audience was laughing a lot.The scenes which were supposed to be sexy, dramatic or tense, wereanything but. Darker was titled as a drama, so i'm guessing that themovie makers didn't plan that Darker would make people laugh more thanan average comedy. And I am not even exaggerating how much peoplelaughed during the movie. It was almost every other scene. If you expect to see some nudity, then you get something more than inthe first movie, but nothing really "shocking" or exciting. Anastasiatakes her panties off like 20 times, but that just doesn't make a moviehot, sweaty or interesting.So if you want to see a terrible movie that has nothing to do witheroticism, drama or good acting, then this is your movie.
