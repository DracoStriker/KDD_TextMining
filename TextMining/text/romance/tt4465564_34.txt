OK so the movie was completely awful, the actors don't share anychemistry between each other, and for a moment there i totally feltlike they didn't even like each other.I gave it 2 stars because the only moment i felt chemistry was when theLeila chick was going to shoot Ana, (a thing i was really hoping tohappen). I don't know if it was only me, but between Jamie Dornan andBella Heathcote the tension was palpable, and guess what...it onlylasted about 15 seconds.So to sum it up...THEY REALLY SHOULD LET THE LEILA BITCH GET MORESCREEN TIME, ALSO JACK HYDE, the blond guy really had potential.
