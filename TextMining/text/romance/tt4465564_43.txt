I couldn't stop laughing from the moment this movie started until theend. From the very bad story line where nothing really happens eventhough there were the 'thrilling' moments inserted to make itinteresting - the girl stalking Ana; Ana's boss taking advantage of heror Christian's helicopter crashing. These scenes attempted to make itexciting but they lead to nowhere. Everyone knows it's the sex that isthe selling point here. And it really shows with all the actors lookingreally bored or wooden because they are really struggling with anunbelievably bad script. Being a sequel, there were the erotic scenescopied from the first movie - Christian picking up Ana to carry overhis shoulder; Christian exercising while Ana looks on and biting herlip. It's that catatonically bad that it has to borrow from thepredecessor.The sex scenes were also comedic. Sam Taylor Johnson in the first 50Shades made it more artistic and feminist. This time however, it ismore like a porn movie by James Foley. His close up of Ana's naked bodyleaves nothing to the imagination. Ana's constant sighing and heavybreathing are overdone and distracting.It's not surprising this movie is worse than the first one despite ahigher IMDb score. I dare not think what the next installment will belike. It will probably be split into two to make even more money. Sexdefinitely sells and EL James and associates are laughing all the wayto the bank.
