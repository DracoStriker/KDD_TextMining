The acting and casting was good in this film and it was a nice storywith some sex scenes but this wasn't Fifty Shades Darker nor was thecharacter Jamie Dornan played, Christian Grey, not even close. Thisfilm was so far removed from the books it was a shockingly terribleadaptation. As mentioned the actors did a good job with what they hadto work with, but the writers made a joke of the original story andcharacters, no turmoil over Christian being a dominant but wanting aloving relationship, no getting to understand the conflict bothChristian and Anna go through with his past and no Doctor Flynn. Justhow did E L James sign this off????
