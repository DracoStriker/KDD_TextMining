Sorry but I'm a big fan I love the books but I cant lie about this one.Personal opinion: 50 shades darker is the first movie that I end uppaying $20 to go see & the biggest disappointment ever. Waiting yearsand it looked like the director didn't even bother to read the books,went short on money and they forgot to hire a writer to finish thescript. Plus the actress needs some acting classes or stop acting alltogether because my God she was like a birth control pill.I personally think that the first one was a much better produced andthe chemistry between the character was more realistic. To me in thissecond movie it was a lack of chemistry and the movie as a hole was notthe best for such a high profile movie.
