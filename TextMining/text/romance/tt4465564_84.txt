Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) has left tycoon Christian Grey (JamieDornan) who is still obsessed with her. They decide to reignite theiraffair. She works for a small publisher under demanding boss Jack Hyde.Christian is looking to buy the company. They are being stalked byChristian's former sub Leila. Anastasia is slowly allowed into hisfamily.I had low expectations before watching this and I'm not eager for it.It's either a low bar to clear or a preconceived notion. There is a bitof both. Johnson is a perfectly appealing actress but she's not allowedto do much. Dornan continues to be a stiff actor. Despite the promiseof the edgy sexual matter, their romance is as boring as heck. Leilacould have been a compelling thriller villain but she ends up as asecondary plot. The family drama is hinted at but delivers very little.There's a ridiculously undramatic helicopter crash for very littleresult. I don't hate this but I just find it boring.
