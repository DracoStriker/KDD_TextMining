So, they make a movie based on an erotic book (when did that endwell?), hire two actors nobody ever heard about, both possessing zeropersonality and even less chemistry between them, and it's a solidflop, hated equally by viewers and critics. Even the trailer looksextremely boring. And it's about sex! Then they come back for a second helping with the same exact result? Idon't understand how this works and what's the point of making sequelsto crappy movies. Does it make sense financially? Tyler Perry, pleasehelp!
