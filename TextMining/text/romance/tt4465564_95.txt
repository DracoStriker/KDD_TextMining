This film tells the story of the billionaire with a scarred past. Hefalls in love again with the woman who left him 18 months ago becauseof his alternative tastes.When "Fifty Shades Darker" was in the cinemas, the billboards say thatit is a romantic film. This is somewhat a surprise as it is famous forhaving a character with an alternative lifestyle. However, it is notreally a surprise when I give it more thought, because the first filmwas mostly about them seducing each other. After watching "Fifty ShadesDarker", I think it really is a romantic film. It does not get anydarker, just sweeter with every minute. Both Jamie Dornan and DakotaJohnson are very attractive. Christian Grey's penthouse is very stylishand modern, I wish I could live there! I enjoyed watching this film. Iwonder what the third one will be like.
