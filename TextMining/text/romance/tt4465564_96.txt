Okay Fifty shades darker ripped my heart out and stomped on it in moreways than one. Christian Grey made a complete 180 from the first film.(side note) I have read the books and Grey which is FSOG in Christian'sPOV! I loved seeing Ana and Christian grow together as well asseparately. It was nice seeing a bits of Christian's backstory, thethird movie we will get to see some more i expect. Since that's whathappened in the novels. the ending with Christian popping the questionmelted my heart and make me swoon. I can't wait for February 9th 2018Fifty shades Freed... I think I'll have to reread the books!
