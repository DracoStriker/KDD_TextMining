So I just Finished Nocturnal Animals and to put as bluntly as possibleI absolutely loved it and it might end up being one of my top 10favorite movie of the year. Well it's basically two movies in one. Onehalf appeals to my lust for grim blood soaked, dark genre fare whilethe other half plays like an interpersonal glossy drama that's just ascompelling. Both feel as if they could hold entire films in their ownright and grabbed me till the very end. It's much better if you go incold so I won't really say much more but if you love a good thriller,crime drama or just good film making in general and it's playing nearyou please do yourself a favor and let Mr Tom Ford take you on a tripthrough some movie magic.
