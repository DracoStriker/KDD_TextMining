Nocturnal Animals is your typical revenge tale where innocent losergets rekt by people whose favorite past time is being evil stereotypes.Then sudden personality change and sweet, sweet revenge. Or not.Typically movie of this sort would be 5/10 and well worth the watchingdespite the mediocrities. Nocturnal Animals does manage to do fewthings in such advanced awfulness, that it becomes close tounwatchable.1) Jake Gyllenhaal's character is so boring, blatant and useless thatthere is no reasonable explanation to care about what happens to him orhis family. I found the generic bad guys to be more relatable than thispersonality lacking loser of a man. And those guys didn't even havepersonalities either. 2) The editing. This is a story withing a story. In execution this islot like a time skip which doesn't skip time - more familiarly knows asthe Fairy Tail Trolling. It doesn't add anything to the story, butmanages to annoy with its amateurish nature. +) The hype. This was supposed to be a good movie. 5/10 at least. Itwas bigger disappointment than average movie could have been. +) Amy Adams is called a main character and she is in the poster. Inthe movie, she just reads a book and wears makeup. Please, she was usedas a marketing bait here.
