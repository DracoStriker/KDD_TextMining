Good acting, good camera work, decent 'noire' does not a good moviemake. This movie was so up it's own hole I wish I was having a seizureto make watching it more interesting. It could have been a decentmovie, if it were one movie, rather it's several pieces of hit mushedtogether asking to be a polished turd. Literally a bad book wrappedinto two awful movies. You can obviously tell there are cut out scenesdue to garbage editing. That being said kudos to the editor becausetaking more out of this terrible film only made it better.Good acting.Skip this movie.
