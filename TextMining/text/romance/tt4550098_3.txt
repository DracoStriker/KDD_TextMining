The latest directorial effort from fashion designer Tom Ford, NocturnalAnimals is an assault on the senses. I say this as a complement though.From the gaudy and gratuitous opening credits to it's varied palette ofmoody colours, it screams excess and expense. But unlike many moviesthat feature visuals like these, the movie doesn't paint thempositively. Instead, our main character is trapped in a terrifyinglimbo of what she admits is her own creation. One day, she receives amanuscript from her ex-husband, played by Jake Gyllenhal. Due to theirrough split almost two decades prior, she reads into every word. The manuscript weaves a story that resonates with her broken state ofliving. She wonders. Is it a threat? Just a harmless attempt toreconnect? Or something else entirely? Cue top class acting and a storythat is as dark as they come. This is a short review and there is areason why. Nocturnal Animals is a movie best experienced with aslittle prior knowledge of the plot as possible. So, get out there. Inthe jungle of mostly underwhelming movies that is 2016, this is a movieyou can't miss out on.
