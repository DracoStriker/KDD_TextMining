This is the ultimate crap of a movie. If you want to cringe for an hourand 56 minutes, then go and see it. We have Jake Gyllenhaal who is bothTony Hastings and Edward Sheffield. Well, one of them is his fictionalcharacter, or maybe he is not. That's something you will understandonce the movie is over. Now, after you realize who is who and who didwhat and why... you will say: AND THAT'S IT?!. This is the type ofmovie you go to watch because of the cast, and don't get me wrong, AmyAdams did one hell of a job in this, and Michael Shannon was awesome ashe is in all of his movies, but that's it. This "movie" doesn't have ameaning. It doesn't have any message. It's just a 1.56 hours of"something", and I bet that even the producer doesn't know what it is.Yes, i'm talking to you Tom Ford. There are easier jobs if you did notknow. You can work in McDonald's for example. That job requires as muchimagination and logic as you put in while working on Nocturnal Animals.
