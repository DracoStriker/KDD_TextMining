Sleek, stylish, well acted. 'Nocturnal Animals' is fashion designerturned director Tom Ford's (with whom I wasn't familiar before) secondmovie. Visually beautiful to look at it, but it's actually more shallowthan it looks at first glance - but that doesn't mean it's bad film.The structure of the film and how these stories are connected giveslittle to think over after the film is finished. Melodrama, mixed withtragic and violent revenge tale with little lynchian vibe. I love howTom Ford used two different time lines and a (parallel) fantasyuniverse to tell one story. Interesting angle is that we actually don'tmeet one of the main characters - we see him only through othercharacter's perspective. Acting works were mainly fantastic startingfrom to leads Amy Adams (she deserves another Oscar nomination for herperformance), Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon and AaronTaylor-Johnson.Ambitious and ambiguous 'Nocturnal Animals' offers wonderful visualstorytelling with great performances and many ways to analyze the film.Not a masterpiece, but worth to watch.
