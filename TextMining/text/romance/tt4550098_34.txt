So I'm a film lover and I've seen plenty of fantastic art pieces andindie films that were amazing. Nocturnal Animals was NOT one of them.This is the type of movie that is either way too intellectual for me orpretends to be. I don't even think I understand what went on throughoutthe course of the film. It's about life imitating art or vice versa Ihave no idea and I want to care but I don't. If this utter drivel getsany Oscar nominations I might throw up. I had to force myself throughit and I can't think of a single redeeming quality except for maybethat the lead actors are all very good at being intense, you just won'tunderstand why they're intense.Amy Adams is an okay actress in my book but I'm also feeling the oversaturation. She seems to get used in films over and over and over againand because they tend to be critical darlings which means she oftenplays bizarre over the top roles that her sweet innocence fits somehowwith a dark twist. She is appropriately messed up in this. I don't knowabout what....I'm confused. Please don't nominate her for an Oscar.Jake Gyllenhaal is also a very good actor who often takes strange,twisted roles. His performance last year in Nightcrawler worked betterthan this. He's a writer and he wrote this book where he's married toAdams but she gets murdered and...I dunno. I will say they're chemistryis good so there is that. Michael Shannon shows up as a grizzled copwho looks like I felt all the way through the movie.So who is Tom Ford? Someone who wrote two screenplays now and directedthem both. I don't think I've seen A Single Man but I'd be hesitant tonow. Maybe like I said this is his art and I don't get it but I reallydidn't get it. This was a mess that made 0 sense to me. Unless you wantsomething to unpack and explore or you're someone who just loves indiefilm and art this is completely miss-able trust me! 1/10
