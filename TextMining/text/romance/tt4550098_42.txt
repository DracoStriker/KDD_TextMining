This film basically consisted of a bunch of guys waving guns at eachother without knowing how to use them properly (including the sheriff)which isn't a surprise coming from an artsy director who has probablynever held a gun in his life. Not that there's anything wrong withbeing artsy but sometimes you lose pragmatism for the sake of style.The protagonist (Jake Gynelhall's character) is so much of a wimp whenit comes to protecting his family, it's hard to relate to him. AmyAdam's story consists of her whimsically lying around, reading thisnovel, and reminiscing over a past romance while questioning hercurrent one. There's two stories happening simultaneously, which couldbe interesting if somehow tied together, but all the director gives usare clever screen transitions. I much preferred "The Neon Demon" ifyou're looking for a glimpse into Los Angeles' art-world elite. It'sdarker and even more twisted.
