I loved this movie, I'm not into fashion and I had no idea who Tom Fordwas, but I thought it was compelling, bittersweet, and mature storytelling. Maybe the thematic colour and art direction was a bit much forsome, but I loved it.Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Shannon all did brilliantly andalthough there are a few jumps between time lines, I never felt lost(and I'm always that person!). It might not be the most unique story ever told, but it was a classictold beautifully right to the end.
