I've read some pretty gnarly reviews and I don't really understand why.I mean, there was room for improvement but overall, I think it's quitea dark film when you really think about it. The idea that the car sceneis a complete a possibility shook me a bit. All of the actors werepretty impressive, IMO. Although I must admit that Michael Sheen was abit... awkward? Still trying to figure out what the point of him was inthe film. The very opening scene was a bit much for my personal tasteand I have no idea where Mr. Ford was going with that exactly, but Ihave awarded this film 8 out 10 stars because I do believe whilst ithas many moments of "privileged" people having basic life issues,there's also the reminder shown that money really can't buy youeverything.. namely, love.
