Its an uninspired and non-surprising moving. It's like Tom Ford thought"hey, let's make something with art" and used all tools he could findin his lunchbox. The end is non-surprising, the story between isnon-surprising and it has logical deficits. Why does the sheriff notlook at Tony, when he is searching for the killer of his wife anddaughter? Why did Tony talk and talk and talk, but didn't shoot thekiller in the first moment - haven't he seen in movies, what happens ifI talk and talk to the killer? The only interesting character in thecomplete movie is the sheriff. The start of the movie - old nakeddancing woman - is awful. If you have the impulse to run out the cinema- it is the right moment. This movie is a waste of lifetime.
