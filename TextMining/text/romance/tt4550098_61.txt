7.5 for this utter drivel - I smell a campaign from the movie company.What an utterly pointless load of excrement this film was.Other than showing off equally ludicrous haute couture from thedirector there was absolutely no reason to make this.Quite what the stars in this were thinking when they sign up we willnever know - probably money.
