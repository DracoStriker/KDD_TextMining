I don't understand all the negative reviews. I think the movie had aninteresting concept, I enjoyed the acting and the set design, lighting,etc. I enjoyed the suspense of the novel as we went along with AmyAdam's character, but somehow the movie left me cold and hanging in theend. I guess I would have liked closure, but life is not like that. Thenovel within the movie kept me on the edge of my seat, great sound andmusic. Amy's character seemed so lost and desperately reaching outparalleling the Main character in the Novel, but like him, she endedalone cold and 'dead' in her own way. I enjoyed the ride, however but Ifelt empty in the end. Perhaps that was the goal of the director. Welltold, well acted and held one's attention to the end...or at leastmine!
