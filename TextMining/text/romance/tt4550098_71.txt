Utter crap. Complete waste of idle time. I'm sorry I didn't watch ANYother movie instead of watching this. People with good taste,beware...don't let this movie bring you down to their level of cheap,dime store, dim-witted "entertainment." Putting aside the Homosexuality(no surprise with John Ford), fornication by underage children, rape,adultery, womanification/wimpification of manliness by an idiot whowon't defend his family, Taking a liberal jab attack againstConservatives, religious people, people who have morals and respect theBible by calling them racist bigots who are evil narcissists (likeobama & hillary) that judge people (Like Amy Adams is actually doingwith her character in this film). Thinking it's "OK" to find out yourbest friend is actually a homosexual who had a crush on you as a youth,you are then commended by Amy Adam's character for being such a greatguy. Unrealistic and a complete fictionalization of an event that wouldnever occur if it unfolded in the real world where people are normaland actually have common sense and a sense of morality (at least somedo).
