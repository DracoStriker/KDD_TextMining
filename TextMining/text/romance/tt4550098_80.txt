Nocturnal animals is a unique story, as it follows two stories, thenovel of Edward and Susan reading the book. Nocturnal Animals is agreat example of using imagery to convey a message. This film has theunderlying theme of revenge, which is truly observed through Susan'slife. Jake Gyllenhaal and Aaron Taylor-Johnson stand out in theirroles, as they work together brilliant on screen. Amy Adams delivers amediocre portrayal of Susan, as I believe any actress could act inplace of her.Nocturnal Animals is a good story about revenge. 8/10
