I'm going to give Everything Everything an 8 because it's good, but notthat good. Nick Robinson really steals the show here, he is an amazingactor and I feel like without him this movie would of been a 4 butsince they hired Nick it's an 8. The story plot is good, but I feellike the other minor actors in the movie could of been fleshed out moreand they could of had more to do. Amandla is a good actress too andvery pretty, but she could only work with the material given. I justthink the movie was missing something. It was just too focused on Maddynot leaving the house. I did enjoy the little twist, I didn't see thatcoming and the actress that plays the mother was good, but again wehardly saw her. This is the first review I wrote that I gave the movieanything lower than a 10. I felt like Everything Everything should geta review, but it definitely was not a 10. Go see it, it's not terribl,it is just missing something. Oh and the movie was beautifully shot andthe director was good too!
