This film is similar to the fault in our stars in many ways, it doesn'tinvolve cancer but it does involve one teen suffering from a disease.Madeline (Amandla Stenberg) is an 18 year old girl who lives with herdoctor mother in California, her father and brother died in a caraccident years ago. And Olly (Nick Robinson) is an 18 year old boywho's just moved in next door to Madeline and her mother. Madeline hasSCID, a disease where you're blood cells can't fight off simplebacteria, so she is forced to always stay inside the house because shecould die if she doesn't. Madeline and Olly form a bond/connectionthrough texting and holding up messages against the windows, they getto know one another and eventually begin to have romantic feelingstowards one another. The chemistry between Nick Robinson and AmandlaStenberg was great, I really loved how they connected on screen and Ibought their feelings for each other. The performances were very goodfrom all cast members, Anika Noni Rose included. I thought Rose'sperformance was very commendable. The plot can be pretty predictable attimes, but what made the movie work for me was the two leadsperformances and their romantic chemistry. That's what makes the movieworth seeing. 7/10, I do suggest everything everything.
