This is one of the worst movies I've seen so far, it is really bad,almost all of it. Good: Sometimes present some interesting concepts andmake look the point of view of the characters more understandable, itisn't afraid of using some fictional circumstances to let the movieadvance. BAD: It is a mediocre story, too many falls and it can be morethen a movie for(hyperbole) ugly fat teenagers with self-care problemsthat hate everyone because nobody likes her, but even hating them shestill dream with a handsome guy to f*ck her at the age of 13-16, OK no,but it still doesn't have a real background, the construction of thecharacters are really poor, and the main purpose of the story ispouting the girl like a victim, it's just bad, for a lot of reasons butI don't have more time
