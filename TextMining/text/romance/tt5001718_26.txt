If you love the rinse and repeat "films" the Hallmark Channel pumps outof their factory, you will adore this one.Everything, Everything plays out exactly as you may expect: Girl meetsguy, girl falls for guy, *insert early third-act conflict, happily everafter. This can be done right, but as we see in this work, the horse isfar dead.If you enjoy a well-written romance with fleshed-out and relatablecharacters and a story you can invest yourself in, avoid this likeEbola. If you like a movie that doesn't challenge you and lets you hidein your safe space where you can be assured a mega-super-happy ending,buy the special-edition steelcase Blu-ray.
