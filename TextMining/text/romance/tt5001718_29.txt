Amandla Stenberg is beautiful as 18 year old Maddy, the girl who spenther whole entire life indoors because of this illness that apparentlywould kill her if she left the house. Her only socialization is hersmothering mother, her somewhat fairy god mother nurse Carla andCarla's daughter.Maddy's life changes when a family moves in next door. As Maddy watchesthis family from her window, she catches the attention of the new boyOlly. Olly soon discovers Maddy's condition but that does not stop himfrom wanting to get to know her/ falling in love with her.Maddy builds little models of diners, libraries etc, and in her modelsshe places a little astronaut in them. Maddy then fantasies of being inreal life versions of her models with Olly. Each time Maddy fantasiesthere's always an astronaut in the background. I find this really cute.Behind her mother's back, her lovely nurse allows for Olly to come inthe house and meet Maddy and their romance soon blossoms.Overall this movie feels like Rapunzel. Maddy being Rapunzel and hermother being the Witch/Mother Gothel. Olly (the handsome prince) comesto rescue Maddy and shows her how wonderful the world is. This movie is beautiful and the colors are beautiful. I loved it A+I LOVE THIS MOVIE.
