I'm an action movie kind of guy. I see every Marvel, DC andtransformers movie as soon as they come out. I care not for chickflicks. Luckily my wife doesn't force me to go to them either. Iwatched this movie because it's our anniversary and I wanted to watch amovie I knew my wife would enjoy. I went into this movie with a Largesoda and Large popcorn with the expectation to keep myself energized sothat I wouldn't fall asleep on my wife. NOT NEEDED.This movie didn't have the most action packed story line but the storyline was good. They progressed the story at a good pace, not lingeringon any one scene too long. They did a good job developing thecharacters backgrounds and helping you understand everyone and had anice plot twist at the end that didn't feel rushed as if they had runout of budget. They also didn't linger with the closing.While this movie didn't make me want to go see other chick flicks or goread the book, I definitely enjoyed this movie. I know that some of theways they portrayed SCID and people who are disabled isn't necessarilyaccurate, but it doesn't take away from the quality of the movie. Afterall, this wasn't a documentary but a romance movie so I'm OK with themtaking a few liberties with the portrayal of her condition.
