This film truly gave me all the feels, it shows that there is some onewho can love you no matter what is going on in your life. A boy moving in next door and falling in love with you sounds like afairy tale but this story has its ups and downs but shows that togetheryou can achieve anything. I think this story was very well told and Iwish there was a sequel to it as I would love to know what happenednext with Maddy and Olly and his family.
