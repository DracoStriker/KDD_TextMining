Greetings from Lithuania."Everything, Everything" (2017) is not a bad movie, but it was soaverage, mediocre and predictable that i couldn't recommend to watchit. While the premise does sound kinda fresh, at the end there isn'tanything fresh in this movie. The worst thing here are three main factors - poorly mediocre directing(no suspense, although pacing was not bad), script and casting. Thestory is told without any excitement nor originality. While acting bytwo lead unknown (at least for me) actors wasn't bad, there is ZEROchemistry between them - they just said the lines they were asked in away they learned at their acting schools. Overall, even the twist at the end of "Everything, Everything" can notsave this movie from being mediocre at its best. And about that twist(which i predicted from the first second i heard the premise) - it wasshown without any "wow" factor, as the whole movie itself. There isanything you will miss if you skip this flick, yet if you catch it onTV on some boring evening, you might check it out for one time. On aVERY boring evening.
