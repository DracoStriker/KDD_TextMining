I've just watched this movie and I absolutely loved it! I'm just sad Ididn't read the book first, because I love reading and I think it'sbetter to read a book first, and then watch the movie based on it. I'ma hopeless romantic, so this movie was perfect for me, especially onthis days when I felt really bad, so it helped me a lot and made mesmile. I DEFINITELY recommend it to everyone!
