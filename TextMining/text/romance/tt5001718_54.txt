At first seeing this movie was a little bit nerve-racking to mebecause, in my opinion, every movie that has a book before it neverreally is up to par with the book. Although Everything, Everythingstayed in the story line the ending felt very rushed to me and youcould not get the same feeling of the shock that her mother was keepingher inside her whole life because of her personal fears.I believe thatAmandla Stenburg and Nick Robinson did an amazing job in theirperforming and although they had a different hardship than the usualinterracial relationship does, the directer using Maddy's(Amandla)talent of building sculptures to bring them together through their textmessages was a very good contribution to the movie.Reading the bookfirst also had it's peaks because you got to know more about the storylike Olly's high energy level and why he kept walking across the greenroom and flicked his rubber band at her. Besides the ending being a bitrushed the film really brings the book to life and tells the story ofthe newly 18 year old that has never gotten to go outside because ofher uncommon disease ,skid, and all in a few days gets the adventure ofher life, gets the truth and her freedom. It is still an amazing movieto go and experience has an amazing soundtrack and good actors that fitthe characters perfectly.
