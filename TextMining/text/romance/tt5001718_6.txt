My girlfriend absolutely loves chick flicks. While I am not a fan; I'mmore than happy to watch what will make her happy. This movie washorrible. That's coming from her. I cannot describe the relief I feltwhen my girlfriend turned to me at the end of the movie and said "thatwas awful." Spoilers here: Onto the aspects of the movie itself. You have a verygeneric male character who has a vague background of living with anabusive and dead-beat father. I'm going to assume that he's the firstboy to ever move in next-door to Maddy (the girl with the "disease").With the help of a nurse, the boy (who the audience will come to knowas Olly) is allowed to have a couple of secret visits with Maddy. Longstory short, the two of them fall in love via text message and throughthese visits. The nurse gets fired (after 15 years of service) forthese visits, the mother of Maddy turns out to be semi-deranged, Ollymoves his family to New York, and Maddy finds out the truth of whyshe's been locked away for 18 years. If you enjoy cringing excessively through a movie, this is the flickfor you.
