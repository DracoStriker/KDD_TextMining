. . . that Warner Bros. would spend even one Red Cent on a movieproject as implausible, trite, and contrived as this Teenie-BopperRomCom, EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING. However, the paltry imaginations ofsuch pundits cannot see the Hawaiian coconuts hanging in EVERYTHING'sMexican trees. Substituting Mexico as a filming location for the YoungAdult Bodice-Ripper paperback's Hawaii setting is just one of countlesschanges Warner makes to get their True Meaning across to America'sYouth in the most Cost-Effective Way possible. Maddie's Evil Momrepresents the Fat Cat Rich People Party Trumpsters, lying to ModernMillenials and U.S. kids such as Maddie that ObamaCare is Bad. LikeMaddie's Mom, these Corrupt Capitalist Schemers want to keep the U.S.population in a Fake News Bubble, telling us that We Can't Handle theTruth, and that ANY contact with Reality will be FATAL to our weaksensibilities. Warner Bros. uses Ollie to represent the only hope forWe True Blue Patriotic Loyal Average Normal Union Label Americans: AProgressive Labor Party. Warner warns us that WE have to choose whetherto live Under the Thumb of Evil Lying Trumpsters such as Maddie's Mom,or escape to the Clear Light of a New Day under a Progressive Sun.
