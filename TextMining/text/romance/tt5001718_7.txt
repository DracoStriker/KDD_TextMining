"Everything everything" is probably one of the cheesiest movie I'veever seen. Let me explain. I get it, it's a teenager movie. Nothingwrong with that, except for me it doesn't send the right message. It'ssimply a polished version of reality. Sure I'll grant that there's beena little bit of thought put into the plot (arguable) but the dialogues,the characters, the music ... no depth. I'm usually not that harsh onmovies but this one I have to say is just a scam. The whole purpose ofa romantic drama is to make the audience feel something. The nonexistent depth I was talking about earlier is therefore essential tothat type of movie. "Everything everything" could be compared to anunfinished canvas, we've got the main colors, we've got the shapes,we've got a few brushstrokes but a lot of elements are missing. I workon the assumption that what makes a good movie is the unpredictable,that small instant when you say to yourself "didn't see that coming !".Well, I'm sorry to say that that movie is quite the opposite of a goodmovie. No suspense whatsoever. Everything is predictable. Everything.
