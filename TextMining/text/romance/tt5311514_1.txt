In truth, the most competitive area of fiction is not invasions fromouter space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather the mostbasic narrative of all, the love story.And this is also the most overcrowded field, and the most difficult todo right.This film, this story, is extraordinary. It reminds me of MY SASSYGIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the worldand has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN,another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done asthe movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing argumentsabout which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than theother. I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all,because I cannot imagine any other country producing something thismoving, this powerful, in graphic form.
