I feel like this film was divinely inspired. It is beautiful, yetotherworldly. Without even trying, it hits hidden chords within thehuman psyche that bring out a torrent of feelings that we never knew wehad, or had long forgotten about. When I watched it with my friends, who are normally chatty andsarcastic during movies - they were completely silent, awestruckimmersed wholeheartedly. They were quiet, save for a few "wows!" at thebeauty and detail of the art in this film. When the credits came, they were still so enthralled they just watchedthe credit roll, without moving or wanting desperately to rush back totheir busy lives and schedules. This movie nourished our souls and gaveus something we didn't know we needed. We didn't know movies could bethis profound, this touching, this meaningful. Think of the most touching and beautiful movie/scene you've ever seen,and loved, and it still doesn't come close to what this film has.Calling it a masterpiece isn't enough. It was more than a masterpiece. 10 as a rating isn't enough, either. There is no number great enough topay back what this film has given me.
