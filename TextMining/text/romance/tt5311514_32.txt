Whoaa ! I don't know where to start from. This is one of movies thatleft me speechless ! I've been shaken, it instantly made me impressedand deifying it. I praise this movie in an apex ladder board.Forgetting this movie for the rest of your life is just infinitesimalchance. I've been eroded and impaired by its visionary, beauty, andemotional form. What a zeal, Makoto ! Here he comes ! Praise the luck oh people, wefound a new movie professor here. We found a predecessor of Miyazaki,an anime-making skill similar to him. Well maybe now we can call Makotois paternal to Miyazaki, but maybe moments later reach in peer orsurpass. Praise the lord, this is Japan, a new born history-maker hasarrive. I write this as a rite of his advent.This movie has a very strong impact to its viewer. Makoto combinesci-fi and drama to bring affection, love, tension, and thrill. By itsform YN is incredibly complex. It plays the plot forth and back andconnect it slowly but surprisingly impetuous. You could never guessanything in YN because Makoto wrap the story neatly and unwrap it inthe right time and structure. All that you get only a shake in yourbody knowing how beautiful and twisting the story is. This is one ofthe most original movie this year, and the originality seems bonded toits viewer by its memories and visionary idea. This is a real contenderto holywoods animationsYour name is a solid movie and it instantly in my top list movies.Prepare to be surprised by its beauty and twisting story. Japan has anew-born star now, Makoto is genius and a heart-breaker !
