"Your Name" took a while to get an American release but so anticipationfor this film has been rising. Especially since so many say its great!The story centers on two main characters living in Japan whose livesare closely connected. Taki and Mitsuha are both teenage students whowake up in each other's bodies and begin to grow as characters and intheir appreciation for each other by living their lives. By far the most astounding aspect of this film is its story andbeautifully constructed narrative. The story structure manages to keepits audience on the tip of their toes to focus while never losingitself in convolution. Makoto Shinkai has managed to craft a beautifulstory that both touches the heart and makes you laugh out loud(considerably hard at some parts). This blend of drama and comedy makethis piece both deeply and emotionally resonating, as well asundeniably enjoyable. The animation itself is a thing of beauty. If anyone has seen thetrailer, they know this movie offers beautiful and captivatinganimation from the very first shot. Hopefully, this film will gain traction in the U.S. considering ittruly is one of the most breathtaking film experiences I've ever been apart of. It's become a personal favorite and is definitely the kind ofmovie that should be praised and seen by as many have the opportunity.Definitely give this a good watch and bring kids to see it too (maybe abit older kids)!
