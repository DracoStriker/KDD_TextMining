I have been a "Makoto Shinka" fan lately, i mean his works aremarvelous, splendid indeed."your name", at first i have no clue what amgonna be experiencing, and in the end is more than i could havepossibly imagined it to be. i mean we all know about "body shifting,comet mysteries, guardian gods, and yeah teen love" but what you'll beexperiencing here is totally "Makoto Shinka" magic, who takes our soulsinto his world while our body is still watching and wondering how weeven got there. beautiful, emotional yet innovative and outstandingmasterpiece.
