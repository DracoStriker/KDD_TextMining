I have followed Makoto Shinkai's older works and most of them reallyhave a bad ending, though still good, but this movie's sweet. He reallyknow how to play with our emotion, especially for his work's fans whohave followed his works, i'm hoping its not a bad ending during theentire movie.But man, this work is a true masterpiece. When i looked at Makoto'solder works, I suddenly think, he had the potential to beat Miyazaki'sspirited away, and there he goes. I'm not saying this is better thanspirited away, they had a different genre and makoto had his ownstunning style.How this piece of animation would turn my emotion really hard? EvenSpirited Away, When Marnie was There, and 5cm per second can't do that.This is a movie that you must watch before you die, really.
