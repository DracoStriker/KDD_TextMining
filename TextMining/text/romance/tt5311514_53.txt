I didn't find this as elegant or refined as Miyazaki's best work, but Ithought it was much more emotionally powerful. Seeing it with a goodaudience helps: I was moved when someone in the theater audibly gaspedand involuntarily wailed "No!" at one point in the movie. She spoke forall of us, because we were all bound up as one in that moment. That's agreat movie.
