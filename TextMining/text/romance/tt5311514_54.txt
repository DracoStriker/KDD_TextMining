The best way I can describe the quality of this anime is that, halfwayinto the view, I had to watch the end to make sure it wasn't a 5mm/secthing. First: we find a perfect integration with the previous works, ina very gentle way. I jumped up when I saw the name of the Italianrestaurant, for example, or the teacher... a zen garden of references.Second: it covers all emotions within the human spectrum of feelings.From funny to desperate to hatred. Amazing how the characters, and theplot, move so naturally from one state of mind to another. Nothingdramatic has to happen: it's all so natural. Third: the plot isoriginal and unpredictable. "You never know what you are gonna getnext". Fourth: sometimes it's not the devil, hiding into details, butperfection. This is it, I could go on for hours. This anime shocked mein a very positive way. Work of genius.
