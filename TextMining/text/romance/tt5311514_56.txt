This anime makes me speechless, I watch this movie with very highexpectation from all the reviews I have read and it was worth all ofthe good reviews out there. The scenes were so beautiful, it makes mewant to drawn into it, from the view of the Itomi village to the scenesof the comet falling down, everything was outstanding. I was not expectmuch about the story, just thought it was some boy & girl love storybut then I was wrong, the story is much more than that. It makes methink about people we have met, have forgotten, about how people reactto the disasters.That's movie is worth 1.5 hour of your life and I truly hope that itcan won an Oscar.
