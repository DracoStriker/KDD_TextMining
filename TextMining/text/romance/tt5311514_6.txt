I started watching this movie with high expectations,but somehow thismovie managed to be exceed them.Movie didn't just look amazing,which isexpected from Makoto Shinkai,but story is amazing as well,it manages tokeep attention of viewer from start to finish,and as movie progress itjust gets better and better.I think that everyone that loves moviesshould watch this.Even if someone doesn't like animated movies theyshould give this movie a try.Also i love how some little things that at first seem meaningless atthe end of movie get amazing meaning. Personally i think this is bestwork that Makoto Shinkai made by far,its above all of his previousworks,and doesn't have flaws that some of his other works had.
