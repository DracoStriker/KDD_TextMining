I do not want totell the story but I want to tell you that I cried really really hardfor 2 times in this movie. Because it is so beautiful and yet muchtragedy in same time.But in the end I cried even harder. A must see for every movie loversin the world.Another thing, this movie reminds me of how I love Evangelion seriesand movies. It is intense and well made. An astoundingly amazing movie.
