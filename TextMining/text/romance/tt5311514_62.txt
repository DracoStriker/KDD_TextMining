I really loved this film and that surprised me since I am not an animefan in general. But, I am a love story fan. I was a little averse tothe subtitles at first but once I started, it was easy to watch andreally get into it. There are features in this film as deep as some ofthe most deep ones in American love stories and sci-fi. The conceptdraws you in immediately and if you pay attention, it starts to flowand flow and what a fun ride it is.It uses some elements we have seen in a new way and the anime reallyhelps to that end. I have to tell you that after about 5 minutes in, Iforgot the characters were animation, they seemed real to me.I found the two main characters charming. Again, I am not much of ananime fan. I have seen many of them but they aren't my first choice.This would not only appeal to young lovers, like maybe those in lovefor the first time, but it will also rekindle those adolescent/youngadult feelings in anyone who gives it a chance.If you examine my history at IMDb or my own sites you'll see I am notnew at recommending films. Take it from me, this is an instant classic.The artwork is also way above the usually anime bar. Some of thespecial effects had to be done by paintbrush, or by hand however theydid it. It was a feast for the eyes and the story did not suffer.Having said all that, if you can't give it your attention or you reallyhave no interest to sit and watch subtitles, this probably isn't foryou.Give this film your full attention as a love story with some sci fielements and you will not regret it.
