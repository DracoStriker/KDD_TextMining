Your Name is Makoto Shinkai's 4th theatrical release. before this filmhe directed 5 Centimeters per Second and The Garden of Words, both ofwhich I have not seen. this film was a box office success in japan,earning over 300 million yen. this is one of the best romance moviesi've ever seen. the film has incredible animation. the story is about aboy and a girl who experience each others lives while falling in lovewith each other. the film later follows the boy's journey to reunitewith the girl and find out more about her. Makoto Shinkai is one of myfavorite directors and this is his best film.
