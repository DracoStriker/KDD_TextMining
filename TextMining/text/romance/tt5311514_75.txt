Just sit down and watch it. I don't like anime. I'm not an anime guy.So when I say that I watched this movie a year after it came out and itis now my top movie of 2016, that's saying a lot. This really comes toshow how much more flexible animation is than live action. Afterwatching this movie I really honestly consider animation (anime or not)to be the superior storytelling platform, and again I cannot stressthis enough I Don't LIKE ANIME. This movie is beyond anything I hadever seen before and it took days to recover from the emotionaldestruction it brought me
