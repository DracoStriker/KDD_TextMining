I personally loved this film, though I admit I may need to watch it asecond time to fully grasp everything I saw. The story is just somind-boggling! You may end up recognizing some familiar concepts, butthey are presented in a way that is not too "cliche" and withoutshoving romance in your face the entire time. Overall, Your Name is anunforgettable experience. It left me totally mystified. 10/10
