Your Name or Kimi no na wa in Japanese is a anime movie directed byMakoto Shinkai is probably one of the most epic love love story evertold in anime form i ever see.After hearing how much critic and medialove this movie and say this is the best anime movie since HayaoMiyazaki era as an hardcore anime fan myself i am really exited tocheck this movie out when it hit my country theater.This is a verybeautiful anime movie with each scene is a jaws dropping animations anda beautiful movie score that fit the mood of the movie perfectly.Thecharacter is very likable and i find myself investigate more into theside character and the environment not just the two main character.Themovie balance the comedy and the emotion very well that when somethingreally sad or really fun happen the audience can feel the same way asthe character.Is this the best anime movie ever ? Who know but for thecoming of age like i am this is a truly beautiful fun emotion ride andi can see people will talk a lot about this movie just like they didwith Spirited Away when it first came out
