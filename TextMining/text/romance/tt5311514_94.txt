-This was such an enjoyable film! I laughed, and was smilingthroughout. -One of the many things I love about Japanese filmmaking isthat they create a mood. Not every scene is directly plot related, buthelps to bring you into the film. -If you have been, this film willcertainly make you want to return to Japan! A well balanced mix ofTokyo, and Japanese countryside -Heartwarming, and gorgeous. A storyabout a boy and a girl connected through their dreams, and the impactthey make in each other's lives via the dream connection. I definitelyrecommend this film is you have enjoyed any Japanese animation in thepast. One of those heartwarming, easy to watch films that sometimes weall need for a long, joyful exhale of emotion.
