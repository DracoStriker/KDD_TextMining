I would probably have rated it slightly higher if it wasn't because ofthe high score and headlines as Buttcracking funny". It was the mostboring movie I've seen and my partner fell asleep quit early on. As aromance, nothing particularly new or inspiring there either. I wouldsay that the Brits are more capable of making interracial stories thatfeels heartfelt, warm and funny. Holly Hunter and the main characterperformed well but the rest........ :-( I would not recommend thismovie to anyone and do not understand the praise it received. Wouldrather watch 5 episodes of Friends.
