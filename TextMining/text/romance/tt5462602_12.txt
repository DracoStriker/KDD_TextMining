After reading reviews on this site my husband and I decided to see itinstead of one of the heavier more depressing movies currently playingat the local cineplex. Our granddaughter was having a party with kidsand parents and since we don't live in the same town but were visitingfor the week end, we decided to make ourselves scarce. This movieseemed like it might be amusing and somewhat entertaining. It wasn't!It wasn't funny at all. We are movie buffs and rarely walk out of anymovie but had we had somewhere else to go, we would eagerly departedafter the first 30 minutes. We kept waiting for it to take off butright to the last minute there was simply nothing. To be completelyhonest, don't waste your time - even on DVD or streaming!
