Based on the IMDb score, we decided to watch this movie. Unfortunately,although the concept of the movie was great and something to ponderabout, the poor acting, bad dialogues and overall poor flow reallyruined this movie. It was definitely not funny, very dark and the storyline was not well connected. Some people compare this movie to 40 yearsof virgin, or 500 days of summer, and the comparison could not be moreoff.
