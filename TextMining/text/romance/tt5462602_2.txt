I know, I know 10 out of 10 is A LOT. However I'm not sure how theycould top what they have here. Perhaps make it a little longer?? INEVER leave reviews but I just laughed so hard I started snorting andcouldn't stop for a bit! So did a few others in my row! I think thatmeans something. There were so many times were I was laughing hardenough to cry and where I was smiling from the joy on the screen. Don'tget me wrong, it's not all roses and whiskey....but it's def a movie Ithink everyone should see for a myriad of reasons. I'm so glad thismovie was made and that my friend suggested we see it yesterday! I knowyou'll enjoy it so...You're welcome!
