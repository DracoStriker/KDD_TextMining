The Big Sick directed by Michael Showalter is about we the people. Arewe supposed to be nice to someone because they are someone or becausethey are sick with a common ailment ...small sick or sick because theyare in a medically induced coma or stuck in cultural differences... bigsick? Kumail , a stand up comedian, first generation PakistaniAmericanhas a very pleasant demeanor and attracts attention of Emily (ZoëKazan)during one of his shows. Kumail's family wants him to get marriedto a girl with similar religious and cultural background. Kumail keepshis relationships to himself. But after he and Emily split, Emily isnow big sick. The awkwardness of being with Emily's parents is verynicely handled. Ray Romano is very convincing as a caring father andalso as someone who needs to be nice to ex-boyfriend of his daughterwho was not nice to her and now has his own interests. Kumail is verysensitive to Emily's mom and her personality. I am surprised JuddApatow opted to produce movie and not direct it himself. Script issimple and natural. I enjoyed the movie and Kumail Nanjiani did verywell.
