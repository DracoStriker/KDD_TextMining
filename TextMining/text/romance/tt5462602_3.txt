I just loved this movie. Its billed as a comedy and I did laugh outloud frequently but it is also a touching drama of relationship andillness and the quintessential American story of the immigrant family'sson and the white bread girlfriend. It had a very sweet touch, mixingthe comedy and drama. Ray Romano was fantastic as the father of thegirlfriend and I also really liked the girl, Zoe Kazan. Sorry, thisisn't much of a review except to say that it was really very good!
