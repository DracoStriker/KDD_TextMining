This movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy about a standupcomedian. None of the jokes in the movies are funny. There are plenty ofmaterials in the movie itself to joke about, like how the mother triesto set him up with different women. But it was never exploited.The first exchange between the two main characters is not funny. It wasthe comedian berating the woman. And this "joke" is repeated again nearthe end. Some comedians berate and insult the audience and think it'sfunny. It's like high school prank. Better comedians find humor withoutthe insults, or they make fun of a distance 3rd party or themselves.The successful part of the movie is the story about the emotion andrelationship. The comedic part fell short.
