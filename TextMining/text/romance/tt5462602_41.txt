This is not your typical romantic comedy. Don't expect a lot oflaughter. In some ways looks more like British humour. It is not LOL,you have to catch the small details. I found the movie entertaining andsweet, with some important issues being displayed. The acting is goodin general. The plot brings nothing new in a way, but it is original inits own way.
