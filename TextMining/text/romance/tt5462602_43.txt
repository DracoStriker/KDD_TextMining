The only positive points for this overrated film was the entertainingfact it's based on how Kumail and Emily met as well as their trials andtribulations. The pace is very slow and dragged out - 2 hours is way too long forthis story.The writing was poor - bad dialogue, bad humor, dragged out familyconflicts, etc.But the acting was just terrible for all the main leads except RayRomano, who was the only convincing one. The worst actor was KumailNanjiani, and probably should have had a real actor play his role. Hewas very stale, not funny and un-convincing - even playing as himself.It's a very generous 5/10 from me.
