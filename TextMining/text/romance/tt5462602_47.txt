This is a beautiful, touching film based on comedian Kamail Nanjiani'sreal-life story. The tale begins rather simply -- like life often does-- and then builds into a funny, compelling story. Zoe Kazan gives abrilliant performance as Emily, but truthfully the entire cast wasoutstanding -- from Kamail to Kazan to Ray Romano and Holly Hunter andall of Kamal's family and would-be brides.
