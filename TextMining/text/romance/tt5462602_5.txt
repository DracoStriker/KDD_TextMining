Director Michael Showalter ("Hello My Name is Doris" - 2014) has founda terrific collaborative relationship with writer/star Kumail Nanjiani("Silicon Valley") and writer/wife/actor Emily V. Gordon. Based (atleast somewhat) on the real life romance of Kumail and Emily, a couplefrom different cultural backgrounds and traditions, this 'little filmthat could" garnered one of the biggest deals in Sundance Film Festivalhistory. And, everything is right in this film, from the realisticwriting, a storyline filled with plausible surprises, to the terrificcasting of the honest Zoe Kazan "Emily," Holly Hunter and Ray Romano asEmily's parents, Aidy Bryant (SNL), Bo Burnham ("Zack Stone is Gonna BeFamous") and Kurt Braunohler as Kumail's comedy buddies, to the equallygreat and ethnically packed cast featuring Anupam Kher ("Silver LiningPlaybook"), Zenobia Sheriff, Adeel Akhtar ("The Dictator") and ShenazTreasury as Kumail's lovable family, along with a slue of terrificfemale mates for Kumail to marry. David Alan Greir even appears for afew brief scenes as the comedy store MC. The feel of this film is rightin line with "Little Miss Sunshine" and "The Way Way Back," leaving theaudience with a feel good feeling at the films conclusion. Films likethis, much like Melissa McCarthy's "Nobodies" TV show, are filling thescreen with a great group of stand- up/comedy actors that help cementthe production in reliability and truth. With the right PR andword-of-mouth, "The Big Sick" could be a big hit for all involved.
