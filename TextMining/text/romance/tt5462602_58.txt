I caught a free premiere of this movie a couple of weeks ago, thanks toUC San Diego and Amazon. I went with a fairly high expectation sinceJudd Apatow and Amazon produced it, and boy was I satisfied !The story - A stand-up comedian of Pakistani origin falls for a whitegirl. The girls falls into a coma, and the guy needs to bond with thegirl's family while she is recovering. This inter-racial thing formsthe basis for many a gag in this movie - The most hilarious one isabout 9/11, and I have not heard a theater laugh louder. This film is a a real life account of the events that happened betweenwriters Kumail Nanjiani, and his wife Emily Gordon. And because itcomes from real life, there's no stereotyping here - every aspect ofthe movie is genuine. The difference between east and west is sosplitting, and you laugh at both sides. Ray Romano, Holly Hunter, ZoeKazan, Anupam Kher - everyone in the cast does an adequate job. Kumail,the leading man, needs some improvement in the serious scenes. He's anatural in the stand-up sequences. Oh, and Holly Hunter is a blast !I've not seen a funnier movie about a girl in a coma. It's funny, andit's heart warming. I mean what else are you going to do this weekend?Watch transformers? Go for "The Big Sick", you will have a heartylaugh.
