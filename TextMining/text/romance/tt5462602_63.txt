I didn't know much about this movie before watching it. I'd seen thecover and I'd heard it was good, and that was about it. It didn't looklike something I'd normally enjoy, but I knew Michael Showalter haddirected it and I'm a fan of his previous work, and also my girlfriendwanted to watch it so I said okay.I was expecting another dumb comedy, like The Baxter or Stella, whichwould have been okay because I love that stuff when I'm in the rightmood. But unlike his previous works, I came to learn that Showalterdidn't have much, if any, to do with the writing process for The BigSick, and it was something different entirely.It feels much more real, being based on a true story as I would laterlearn. Showalter really branched out here and showed his skill as adirector and storyteller. The film is heartfelt and engaging, neversappy or overly sentimental, although it may make you just a tagmisty-eyed from time to time. It's never predictable but always feelsvery real. The characters are compelling and likable, though flawedjust as we all are in real life, and they're funny, but only ever in avery real way. The laughs feel real, the cringes feel real, and thewhole story feels real.Bravo, Michael Showalter. You've done it again!
