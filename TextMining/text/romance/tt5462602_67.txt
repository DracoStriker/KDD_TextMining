I must have been watching a different film from everybody else. It wasso excruciatingly boring, unfunny, and unengaging I left after about 25minutes. So I can't comment on the whole film, as I didn't see it, butif a film hasn't got my attention in the first 10 minutes, I'd ratherbe doing something else. The acting seemed rather wooden to me, and thedialogue was stilted. The scenes with the family had potential whichwasn't exploited (at least in the ones I saw). You have to care aboutat least one of the characters in a film, and neither of the leadsconvinced me to do that.
