I wasn't sure how to feel about this film. There is so much racialhatred towards Muslims at this point in time, that you are forced tobelieve what the media Portrays. Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordonhave written a fantastic film based on their life events. Whichcompletely shocked me. It is truly humbling and puts all Muslimstereotypes to bed. It does not contain too much drama nor is it tooover comedic. I Would recommend this to anyone!
