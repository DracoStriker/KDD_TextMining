My wife and I enjoyed this at home on DVD from our public library. Itwas written by the real couple, in the DVD extra they explain that whatis in the movie pretty well encapsulates their meeting and marriage.They have been married since 2007. And it is worthwhile seeing the realEmily, she is as delightful as the character we see.Kumail Nanjiani plays himself, Kumail, living in Chicago. As perPakistani custom his parents, particularly his mother, are working onarranging a marriage for him. He shares an apartment with another man,both of them attempting to make their living as stand-up comics, butKumail is a good son and visits his parents often for meals. It is arunning "she was just in the neighborhood and dropped by" as youngunmarried Muslim Pakistani women join them for dinner, arranged by mom.But he simply doesn't feel the dedication to old custom, he doesn'twant to marry someone his parents pick out for him. So one night hemakes a connection with an audience member, Zoe Kazan as Emily, a gradstudent from North Carolina, they develop a great connection and startdating.The title of this movie comes from an incident, which really happened,Emily develops an infection and has to be hospitalized in a medicallyinduced coma. At one point it wasn't clear that she would survive, buther parents from N.C. and Kumail very vigilant, after she pulledthrough she and he realized they wanted to be with each other andmarried 3 months later.The parents were played well and humorously by tiny Holly Hunter asBeth and humongous Ray Romano as Terry.
