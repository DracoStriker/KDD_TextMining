Positive reviews from the media led me to the theater to see this film,but I am sorry to say: I barely laughed once (nothing wrong with that,but, uh, this film is billed as a comedy) and I certainly did not cry:the cuteness and the pathos mixed in this cartoonish scenario did notwork for me at all and felt manipulating. The script is slim, shallow,and the travails of failing stand-up comedians - which is 50% of thisfilm- fail to grab my interest (those travails are a navel-gazing tropethat too many comedian movies already have treated ad nauseam.) It issafe to say I will barely remember having seen it in 2 weeks, exceptmaybe for the performances of Holly Hunter and Ray Romano: they werethe only characters in the script that stood out and felt real amongthe cardboard cast of characters. That a "real life story" leads tosuch a superficial script by the people who lived this story isactually mind-boggling.
