you know the best and the worst time to review a movie is right afteryou've seen it .its the best cos you're emotions are right there andyou can tell if you hated it or loved it .its also the worst cossometimes your just not seeing the movie in the sense it had to seen,you saw it but don't think hard enough while watching it . and lets behonest nobody rushes to write reviews of movie you hate straightawayafter you see it unless it was huge blockbuster like batman vs Supermandoj and it sucked pretty bad .but you know a movie is good if you'vewatched it & you're writing about it in the middle of night but cantjust wait to write what you like bout it. the big sick was one such movie .to me there's a simple way to see if iliked a movie,i'n not a critic, if after coming out of the theater orseeing at home i think about it at night its good.cos who really thinksa lot of a bad movie, you watch it and forget it like a bad appetizer..in the season of over the top epic blockbuster fails one after theother like transformers 3 or 4 or 5 ,the mummy 2 or 3 ,pirates of theCaribbean 4 or 5 or 6.damn,there were a ton of shitty se movie thisyear. the big sick was like a breath of fresh air in a sea of rottenfish . kinda like having a great dessert after horrible starters and anever worse main course.the writing and direction is something that far surpasses the one lineHollywood biggies that have opened this summer .kunal nanjiani did afantastic job of keeping the film light and breezy despite it dealingwith some very sensitive issues on race.cultural differences and lifealtering medical issues .off the bat the performances were excellent byall the characters but especially between the main lead kumail andemily played by the ever so fresh zoe kazan. their chemistry seems sonatural and unforced you cant but help think of your relationships withyour loved one . but this chemistry is further surpassed by the banterbetween kumail and terry (emily's dad).also holly hunter was very goodas emily's mother. the best part about this film was that it showed ushow an regular everyday family would react to a very serious medicalissue affecting a loved one.the film is funny & heartfelt throughout its course of 2 hrs .i'ddefinitely recommend it to my friends & family .its probably the best dramedy of the year.p.s. im not gonna spoil what the movie is about as a movie is bestexperienced when you're not aware of the story.
