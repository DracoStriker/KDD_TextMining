I love it in all my pain of knowing this story in my real life and mybrother dying not waking up like she did. But still even with cryingmost of the movie i have to say i have never seen more accuraterepresentation of how people are in this kind of situation. It was soreal and with the ending i crave in my life... With my brother wakingup.The movie was interesting it had a romance that one could believe withethnic problems and it was able to be funny even with a horrible thinghappening with coma. The diversity between main characters families didnot look forced or excessive but just right. I have an Indian friend hedoesn't even look at white girls because he honors the arrangedmarriage(and is scared of loosing his family) but response the maincharacter had was perfect. You can not just loose family, family staysand love between family can not disappear.. so one must try for love:). I mean it really is all drama, romance and comedy and it makes youfeel strongly. A good unexpected story.
