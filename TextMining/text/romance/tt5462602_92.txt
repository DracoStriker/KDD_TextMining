The big sick is a beautiful film containing aspects of comedy, dramaand romance. It is the partial true story of Stand up comedian and TVactor Kumail Nanjiani's love life. It is a composition of smart comedyalong with family drama. Kumail and Zoe shine with brilliantperformances along with Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. The only faultwith the movie is that Anupam Kher, the legendary Indian actor isunderutilized in this movie. It is one of the best comedy movies ofthis year and should not be missed.
