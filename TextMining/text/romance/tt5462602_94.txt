Question: How many British or American stand up comedians with aheritage from the Indian subcontinent has had an arranged marriage? Theanswer is probably close to zero. If you are going to face a toughaudience every night then standing up to your parents is not going tobe that difficult. After all Shazia Mirza a British female Muslimcomedienne is still unmarried.Therefore The Big Sick feels a little hollow. It is a fictionalisedstory of the romance between Kumail Nanjiani, a Pakistani-American, whowant to be a stand up comedian.He meets a heckler Emily (Zoe Kazan) one night when he is doing hisroutine and they fall in love. However Kumail's parents try to havingfixed up with a woman of Pakistani origin who might suddenly drop infor dinner and who have been briefed to watch The X Files, Kumail'sfavourite television show.Things get complicated when Emily falls ill and is placed in amedically induced coma and he then meets her parents who initiallyrebuff him because they know that he and Emily had recently split up.Kumail needs to prove to Emily, her parents and to himself that heneeds to make his own life choices.Maybe the subject matter is not new to a British audience so there isvery little novelty for me in the central story. Although to anAmerican audience I guess a sensitive portrayal of an American-Pakistani/Indian family tends to be rarer.
