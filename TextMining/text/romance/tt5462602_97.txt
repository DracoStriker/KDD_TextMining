Best Rom Com in a long ass time. It's hard to get solid laughs, haveheart, and be considered a great movie. Boom, Nanjiani pulls it off!That's not all he pulls off, wink wink. TBS is entertaining throughout,with Romano and Hunter almost stealing the show. Although I think thecouch ginger may have been the real MVP for me. Watch: On a date orwith some family. Just go watch it. One word: Rare
