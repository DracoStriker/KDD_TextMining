Of all the genres and all the films out there, romantic comedies aremore often than not the hardest I find to make a connection with,usually because they all tend to blend together by following prettymuch the exact same formula. Every now and then though, a romanticcomedy comes along that really does surprise me in how much I enjoy it.It happened in 2011 with Crazy, Stupid, Love and it's most definitelyhappened this year with The Big Sick.Kumail (Kumail Nanjiani) is a comedian trying to make it to the majorfestival circuits. After being heckled by Emily (Zoe Kazan) at one ofhis shows, the pair begin to date and form a close relationship. Arelationship that is put the ultimate test when their culturaldifferences begin to cast doubt over whether they have any sort of afuture together.It's the personal touch to The Big Sick that makes it such a greatlittle romantic comedy, being loosely based on the real liferelationship between Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon, who he is nowmarried to. Their story drives the film forward and it's full of somegenuinely hilarious moments as well as a number of heartfelt momentsthat derive from both Kumail's Muslim upbringing and the illness thatEmily goes through.The film being such a personal reflection brings out a fine performancefrom Kumail Nanjiani, who's always been one of my favourites fromSilicon Valley, and the chemistry he shares with Zoe Kazan goes a longway in really selling Kumail and Emily's relationship to the audience.There's some fine supporting performances too from the likes of HollyHunter, Ray Romano and Adeel Akhtar, all of them proving that subtlecomedy comes quite easy to them.The Big Sick does run for a little too long however, when the film isas funny and touching as this then it doesn't tend to bother me somuch. I can't recommend this highly enough for a date night at thecinema.
