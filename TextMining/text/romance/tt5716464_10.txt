"Breathe" (2017 release from the UK; 117 min.) brings the story ofRobin Cavendish. "What Follows Is True" announce the big screen as themovie opens. We get to know Robin, who gets to know Diana at a cricketgame and after a whirlwind romance, they marry. We are then transportedto "Kenya 1958", where after playing a tennis match, Robin collapses.He is diagnosed with polio. Paralyzed from the neck down and tried to aventilator, Robin is given three months to live At this point we are 10min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil yourviewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it allplays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of British actor AndySerkis, best known these days for playing Caesar in the "Planet of theApes" franchise reboot. Here Serkis brings us a biopic of RobinCavendish, who really didn't die after just 3 months. Instead Robin andhis wife Diana refuse to give up and try to give Robin a glimmer ofhope and some normalcy. The man's life is truly inspirational. Alas, Iwish I could say the same thing about this movie. Andrew Garfield (asRobin) and Claire Foy (as Diana) do the best they can with the materialthey are given. But the movie lacks overall in drama and feels donestrictly-by-the-numbers. The set's production certainly can't beblamed, and the photography is quite good as well. "Breathe" feels likeOscar-bait but in the end simply doesn't deliver."Breathe" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here inCincinnati. The Sunday matinée screening was attended so-so (probablythe sunny 75 degree weather had something to do with that). I had highhopes for this movie. In the end I felt let down. I encourage you tocheck out "Breathe", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, oreventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.
