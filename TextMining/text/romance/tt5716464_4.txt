Saw this film last night without reading any previously writtenreviews, and I thought it absolutely outstanding. The devotion thatRobin and Diana had for each other, encountering such a life alteringevent only one year into a marriage would likely destroy mostmarriages. Addressing the ignorance and lack of empathy from themedical community must have been a real slog, and it is to their creditthat such amazing inroads were made to better the lives of poliovictims and other disabled persons. While the world has become a betterplace for those "outside the norm", there is still so much yet to bedone. The cast and Jonathan Cavendish should win all the BAFTAs andOscars possible. This film gave me hope that we can all be better thanwe are.
