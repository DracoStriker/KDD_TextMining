This film is magnificent in every respect. Timothee turns in an amazingand memorable performance as Elio. Armie is equally good. I hope thatthis amazing film garners the Oscar attention that it deserves. Thereare many powerful, yet quiet, scenes in this film. The last ten minutesof the film are powerful, and who knew that a great scene would unfoldbefore your eyes as the credits roll. Watch this.
