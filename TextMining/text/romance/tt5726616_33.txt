Here we are in the midst of sexual scandals and we have to glorifypedophilia....Really???? I don't care if it is heterosexual orhomosexual but having a 16 year old son who I try to protect, it angersme that we are trying to normalize this behavior. Teachers are gettingprosecuted for doing the same thing yet this is moving? When an adultis interacting with youth role should be protective of our children.You can justify it all you want but this is against the law.
