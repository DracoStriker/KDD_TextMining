If you have ever stumbled upon an Insta story of a brunch table with apolo shirt lightly hanged on the brim of the chair, a visibly usedPenguin edition of a Thomas Mann roman and a moleskin notebook full ofpretentious calligraphy, all serving as props, welcome to Guadanino'sworld. The characters are moving advertisements of Polo and Lacoste whocarry books they have never read as medals, cite snippets of poets theynever got and surround themselves in a world of art to boost theirshallow egos. Every character of this film is a poor copy of a reallife personality: see the professor who is a more handsome, gayfriendly version of Umberto Eco. Under all this stylization liesnothing. All the spontaneous action feels terribly staged and you cantaste a fear in the air. The fear that if an actor misses one step ofthis mind numbing choreography, the whole world will crumble. Don't askme to think highly of a director who dedicates a whole scene toadvertise espresso.
