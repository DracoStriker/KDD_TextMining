Of course all gay men have been there. You spend your summer holiday onyour father's estate, meets gorgeous young man, fall in love... Call MeBy Your Name is a well executed movie which is actually nothing morethan an escapist gay fantasy. Long before gay-themed movies and booksbecame mainstream, stories like this one were abundant in LGBTperiodicals. Of course this story (like practically any other story)has already been told. The very first example which comes to my mind isBrokeback Mountain. The recently released BBC produced mini-series ManIn An Orange Shirt is also worth mentioning. Elio is handsome andyoung, his father is rich and owns a luxurious villa in Europe. Whenspending his summer holidays on his father's estate Elio meets Oliverwho is also handsome and young and just happens to be gay. The guysspend a lot of time together, swimming, bicycling and visitingneighboring cities. Eventually they have sex. But wait! The story isset in the early 1980-s. So, they can not be together. And their livestake them in different directions. The end. I have no idea if gay manwho will watch this movie (and they definitely will watch it becauseArmie Hammer playing Oliver is very hot even from my straight point ofview) will be able to relate to these characters and their story. Afterall as I said it is a well executed escapist gay themed fantasy.Watchable but not memorable.
