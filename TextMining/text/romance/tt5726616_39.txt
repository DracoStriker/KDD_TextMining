This crap movie does not have a soul in the first place. Its a dumbcelluloid piece! There is no sensible story or acting but weldedcelluloid pieces about some disoriented people wandering not knowingwho lead their own lives. There are worst scenes such as Elio'sintimate scene with a peach - so disgusting, yuck! What does the moviedirector expect us to do with that miserable scene?? PC gone mad if youcriticized this cacophony. Total waste of time and money!
