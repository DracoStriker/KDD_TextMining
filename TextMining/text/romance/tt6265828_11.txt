Spoiler alert. BORING. This movie was a total waste of time. A fewgimmicks and they think they have a movie! I can't believe they wouldrelease something as meaningless and trivial as this. Casey Affleckhasn't acted in a movie yet and this one is no exception. They had overa 1,000 people rating this movie. It must have been the actors, thecrew, and their families. Unless someone wants to spend their $$ andsit through an hour of boring stuff, otherwise forget it.
