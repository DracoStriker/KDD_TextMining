I have never felt the need to give a spoiler warning but it is hard toreview without giving the game away, but I will try.You see this movie is duller than watching paint dry, did somebodyactually put up the funds, boy they must be spitting nails.I tried watching at 4x the speed and it was still painfully slow, Itried 8x but lost the audio, so went back to 4x.There is NOTHING good about this movie. I mean it not a thing.It is hard to say what is more painful, watching it or knowing I cannotget that time back.What is most annoying is that this had an IMDb rating of 73% at thetime of writing, the only explanation can be that they wanted to spreadthe pain of watching this truly awful movie.It is not as if this is some arty title, it is just crap.So you have been warned, it is truly dire from beginning to end.
