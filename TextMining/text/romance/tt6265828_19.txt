Painfully slow - I get the metaphorical stuff. But it's just not thatinteresting. Who the hell cares? The director should have done apseudo-documentary where he can espouse on all the themes depicted inthe film. Have a narrator, some interviews, some re-enactments ofghosts or something similar - teach us something about your beliefs inthe afterlife, etc. - but don't believe for one minute that what youdid was even remotely intriguing - I don't care what YOU as a filmmakerthink about ghosts, mourning, grief, etc. - you chose the wrong mediumto express it. Because it was worse than watching paint dry because inthe end the paint no longer stinks...unlike this self-servingpretentious piece of ca-ca.
