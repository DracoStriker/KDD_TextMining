Amazing! Wonderful! Incredible! Those could be the words describingthis movie. I just forgot a couple words with it, that's all. Let merectify my mistake. Amazingly boring! Wonderfully pretentious!Incredibly overrated! So that's better, that being rectified. Honestlyit's one of the worst movies I ever saw in my life. And I have seetons. You couldn't even spoil this movie by telling you about itbecause there is just nothing to spoil. Nothing happens during theentire movie. And all action shots, yes I know it sounds ridiculouswhen I say action shots, are way too long. Guy is dead and laying on astretcher, let's film that for a couple minutes. Girl is eating hercake while guy with sheet is looking at her, let's film that for tenminutes. And even that the actress couldn't do it right, never saw awoman eat in such a vulgar way. Guy with sheet standing in the roomwhile watching some boring stuff, let's film that for about the entiremovie. There is almost no dialogues so if you get bored just listen tosome music in the meanwhile, or even better just don't watch this pieceof crap. I've been looking the whole time how much longer I had toendure this total mess. At one point there was like twenty minutes leftand the only thing I could think about was that I hoped there would benineteen minutes of end credits. Honestly I can't understand why thispiece of garbage gets such a high rating on here. At least I'm not theonly one that thinks this movie is truly awful. Avoid at all costs!
