All I have to say about this movie is that it is stupid and I've lostall of the respect I had for Roger Ebert for giving it 4/4 starsbecause I only continued to watch it on his recommendation to watch themovie before reading his review thinking it must be good and itwasn't.. also it's rated R for some odd strange reason so the entiretime I'm waiting for something to happen but it never did. The entiremovie is of a mute sheet covered ghost. I don't even know how thatcould be interesting. It is just full of long scenes with no purpose.Watch it if you think it will be interesting.... you will be highlydisappointed. As a side note, the sound of the fork hitting the dish inthe 10 minute pie eating scene made my teeth hurt. I won't even hintabout the note in wall. Just know it will make you mad lol
