Protracted scenes where absolutely nothing happens, and if there wassupposed to be some meaning to these ridiculously long scenes aboutnothing, then I guess I didn't get it. I will not judge the people whoscored this movie high enough that I actually thought I would bewatching something decent, but I can't fathom someone thinking thismovie was anything but a substitute for a sleeping pill.
