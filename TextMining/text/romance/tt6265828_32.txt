I cannot believe that the top-rated comment is so very inaccurate.To begin, David Lowry's previous offering "Ain't Them Bodies Saints"being a hit, sounds more like a plug for that film than a truestatement, due to the fact that it was not considered a hit at all. Go figure.Secondly, when worded so nicely in that 'this story is about a youngcouple who ... (insert all the stuff they supposedly do such as buy thehome and the wife experiencing the moments of life without him, etc.),it sounds great, only that's not true either. It shows none of this,but rather concentrates on the most menial of actions without everexploring more of either their relationship with each other or withanything else. Literally, you get no back story and no ending, and evenif you did, you have nothing to hold the two together besides scenes oftotal mundaneness and dull, boring, tediousness. I will admit that there are a couple of laugh out loud moments. Theproblem is that given the tone of the film, I don't believe thesemoments are supposed to be funny, which makes the film that moreawkward.In closing, one of the reviewers before me said it best: you have beenwarned. This is a bore-fest.
