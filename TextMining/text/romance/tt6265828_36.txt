At the start you are treated to barely audible dialog followed bynever, never, never ending scenes of non movement. These scenes last upto five minutes at a time! literally; imagine five minutes whereabsolutely nothing is happening but a long shot of a house, or acouple, or scenery or anything you can think of. String a bunch ofthese scenes together, add a ghost and you have this movie. This filmcould easily have been made into a twenty five minute television seriesepisode and not lost a single significant moment.
