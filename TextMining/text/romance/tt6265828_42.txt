I saw the rating, saw they actors, figured this is going to be good!Noooo... We have 4.3 screen, we have slow eternal scenes with verylittle action. We have Rooney dragging a box from front door all theway to the road side pile of garbage, Casey looking pensive a fewtimes, smoke drifting from right as camera pans slowly to an accident Hospital scene Rooney standing by a body covered, she walks out, wekeep staring at body which finally moves. Then, reminiscent of mychildhood playing ghost using sheets( but we weren't allowed to cut eyeholes) we have this figure wandering around, Rooney sitting on thefloor in a single eternal scene doing very little and some time lapse,but how long or how or why and we now have 2 ghosts in same house! Comeon! Two great actors acting in this stupidity of a movie, waste oftime! Don't be misled by the rating, don't know what the fringe whogave it a high score have been using to get brain dead!
