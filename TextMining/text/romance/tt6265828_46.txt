They say that pacing is everything in a movie. It has to move. Whetherit moves slowly or quickly might not matter if its a good story withgood acting. Thats why its so ironic that this movie, about a deadperson or two, has ZERO pacing. Just like death.. there you are. Exceptthere WE are sitting in a theater or in a laz-y-boy recliner, wishingwe were dead instead of watching this movie. Maybe we're in purgatory,waiting our turn. Maybe this is a modern version of hell.. no demonsand pitchforks over burning coals. Just watching endless nothingness.Over. And. Over. Frankly, I'd rather be watching a Jerry Lewis movie. And I HATE JerryLewis movies.
