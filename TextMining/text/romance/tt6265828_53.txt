Little to say that hasn't been said but wanted to comment as this filmis just so disappointing. It failed for me (and those viewing with me)at every level ... far too slow in many scenes nearly sent me to sleep... metaphysically absurd (Spirited Away from Ghibli was much moreinteresting)... I do like Affleck but will someone please remind himthat this medium is audio-visual, we need to be able to hear what issaid. I'm tired of him mumbling (about the only time is almost madesense was in Manchester by the Sea). If you like good films then avoidthis one, it has virtually nothing to redeem it.
