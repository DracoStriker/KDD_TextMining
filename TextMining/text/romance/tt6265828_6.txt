My sister and I went to see this movie together.... Mistake! This wasthe worst movie I have ever seen, and I see movies almost every week.It started, we thought the film got stuck, and we should have followedour instincts and left. The entire movie is silent and leaves the moviewatcher waiting for something to happen, anything. I do not understandthe positive rating of 7.8... Maybe I expecting too much when I amhoping for some dialog, anything (the Ghost do "talk" to each other,HA). I can see this movie being replayed on Saturday Night Live.
