A man dies in a car accident and becomes a silent ghost draped in awhite sheet who returns to his home. Dialogue is almost nil. Mostscenes are painfully slow and dull. I loathe that I spent 10 minutes ofmy life watching Rooney Mara eat a pie ad- nauseum. I had a date andwas sort of humiliated that I'd recommended this movie...it's terriblyslow, uneventful, confusing and disinteresting. It was tedious viewingthat frustrated both of us with its lack of continuity, long pauses andincoherent story. We probably would've enjoyed "Wish Upon" betteralthough it has lower ratings. The positive: If you want to fall asleepGhost Story is a wonderfully assistive device. It never perks up andit's as dead as the protagonist. This ghost is profoundly boring andpathetic, tragic melancholy is okay but this is unbearable. The ghostjust stands around silent and shuffles around one locationindefinitely. Casey Afflect had more intrigue in Manchester By The Seaand that film was nearly as tranquilizing as this snoozer is. ThePositive: The acting and set... is pretty good, probably because it'sso minimal, there's not much going on. It makes one think about theafterlife, and can generate conversation. Numerous other films canmanage that task better. It's not worth the price of watching in atheater. Rent it instead of taking Nyquil some night. It will be in abox soon and forgotten more quickly than you can say "I paid $1.50 towatch THIS crap!?!?".
