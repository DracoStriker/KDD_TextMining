Very drawn out, and kinda boring, but in some weird way it keeps youwatching. I found it confusing and was very disappointed in the end. Iwanted to know what was on the note. The pie scene was putting me tosleep...seriously did it have to last that long? I sure hope ghosts arenot hanging out in my home watching my every move...hahaha. Bottomline...save your money, if you think you have to see it, wait for arental.
