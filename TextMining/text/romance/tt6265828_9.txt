The exploration of the enormity of life when a recently deceased ghostreturns to his house to try and reconnect with his wife. Made on a shoestring and in secret, it is a hypnotic observation of life and timeafter we die and it achieves to visually convey the psychologicalweight of certain death and that life will continue once we're gone.The people sitting next to me left the cinema about 20 minutes inbecause it is indeed a very slow moving film and I can understand whythey left but that's the point of the film. Life is not a highlightsreel, and this film achieves to show its enormity through legacy, loveand loss. It is philosophical, psychological and extremely poetic. Awonderfully strange film.
