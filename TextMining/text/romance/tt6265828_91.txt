A couple (Casey Affleck, Rooney Mara) lives in a house. He dies in acar crash in front of their home. At the hospital, he rises wearing asheet like a ghost costume with two eye holes. He haunts her unseen byanybody. She moves out leaving him behind.This is the type of film where his ghost watches her angrily eat a piefor four full minutes in a continuous static shot. It's more art than amovie. Filmmaker David Lowery achieves what he's trying to do. Thefirst half reminds me of Truly Madly Deeply. That movie has other gearsfor the actor to play with. This movie stays with that one gear. Iwaited for the second gear and it transitioned with an interestingturn.The young family provides an opportunity to make a traditional hauntingstory. In fact, that's what I expected but it didn't happen. The movietake another turn. While the last act is poetic, I wonder if thehaunted house would be more intense. It would probably work just aswell in a shortened montage leading into the loop.The sheet ghost may be a striking visual but a sheet without eye holeswould be more logical. This look is one step away from Charlie Brown.At best, it's ET. A sheet without eye holes could be very haunting butit's hard to take this look seriously. Overall, this has an interestingdifferent idea although the execution leaves this strictly in theart-house.
