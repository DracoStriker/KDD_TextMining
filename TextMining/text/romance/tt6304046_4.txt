After reading the fantastic reviews and hearing from friends what agreat film this was, i went in with big expectations. I was, oddly notto my surprise, a bit let down, and i think others will be too. Butthat doesn't mean that you shouldn't go out and watch it!Harboe is the perfect choice for the titular character - every emotionis portrayed with the utmost of believability. Her connection with Anjafeels natural and at times entrancing. If Harboe doesn't win an Amandafor Best Actress i'll boycott the award show. Just saying... The story in engaging, but slow-paced. I don't mind, others might. Thisis a beautiful piece of art, executed with finesse by Trier. Thesoundtrack is underscoring the action without adding too much drama,and you've gotta love every moment Susanne Sundfør's music is playingin the background. A perfect fit for this film. The screenplay has alot of potential, but stumbles here and there. In a way i wish it hadbeen a bit easier on the use of metaphors and symbolism, but at thesame time i can't quite grasp what Thelma really is about. Visually,it's stunning - and that's not a given for Norwegian film. But filmneeds more than stunning photography, cinematography, characters, cgiand music. And that last bit is what's missing here.Summed up: if you don't like Trier's other films, you might not likethis one either. But it's worth the money (!) and your time. Film erbest på kino!
