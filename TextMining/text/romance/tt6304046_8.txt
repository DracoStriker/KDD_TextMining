Norwegian filmmakers (writer/director) Joachim Trier has made anothergreat film together with Eskil Vogt. I simply loved Reprise and thelast before this, Louder than Bombs. Oslo 31st of August is also veryreal though a sad story. Trier is a very promising director, gettingbetter for each film released. But never has he and his writingcompanion Eskil Vogt made anything as profound as this masterpiece.Already in the opening scene this film grips you hard in the neck, andkeeps the grip through. What kind of family is this? Why is the fatherso controlling? Is it something other than love?We meet young Thelma old enough to go studying in Oslo, but we sensethat the family don't like to send her there. Thelma is a fragile,religious girl, from a heavily religious family, hiding some secret, orsecrets. Moe shouldn't be told, other than it seem that when Thelmafalls in love her burdens are too much for her. She feels profoundshame about her feelings.This is a film difficult to categorize. It's a drama-thriller, withmysterious parts, and even some horror elements or if you like someparanormal stiff - if you chose that. Because the film lets you decide.What's wrong with Thelma?The film beautifully shot, with lovely camera work and angles. Somescenes are sublime. As is some effects. The CGI is also sublime. Simplyimmaculate, and totally believably made. Eili Harboe is excellent inthe main role, as are the others.The film is very original, still it reminds in parts of other filmswith troubled girls, like Carrie and films like that.The film has many sides, all positive. It's exciting, mysterious,artful, beautiful, complex, mind-bending, thrilling, tragic, creepy andsensual film explores several different theories and possibilities, andmakes you decide - What's happening to Thelma.Excellent!
