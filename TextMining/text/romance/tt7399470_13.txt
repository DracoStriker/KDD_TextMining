YOGI JAISA JOGI BANO...LIFE #QaribQaribSinglle HOTE HUE DEKHO...The film is lovely to watch and might be good only one coming out inrecent time and once again from Irrfan Khan saab that will be genuinein making us laugh and reminisce or retrospect about lives of married,single in a relationship or singleton completely.Irrfaan saab, needs no introduction, he charms his way slowly into hisrole and then makes us forget what he has done anything before. Thereare many one liners that will make you laugh out loud.For Parvathy, I had been missing her in some way or the other, byavoiding or half seeing her other southern films, but this one proveswhy i was missing all that for.For the film, i won't say much about the story since you can read thesynopsis but i will end on a note that this is not SRK or Varun Dhawancheesy or kissing type of derogatory films but a lovely take on loveand meaning of being single and being with someone who makes you feelspecial.Consider this watching. Don't go for high expectations but enough to bedelighted.
