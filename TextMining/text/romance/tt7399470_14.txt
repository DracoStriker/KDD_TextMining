Right from the release of trailer I was looking forward to watch thismovie after its release. For me its kudos when Times of India rates itand Guruji's gyan blah blah when it's Indian Express. This timecritic's from both daily's were on same page when it came to rate thismovie. Being unsure I anyhow went to see the movie and thankfully endedon same page. Any way my reasons were different. The fear that moviewould turn high on bossy girl nature stayed dim.I liked the acting of the main leads. Irrfan has his own way of Romanceand he is known by that.The first half of the film covers the required story with goodentertainment. This is where the movie scores eight. The second half ofthe movie, although does the work, it lacks entertainment, which couldhave been scripted better. There it scores may be a seven.
