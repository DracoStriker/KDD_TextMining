The movie is OK.And it really worth timepassing its not boring atall.But its a little dramatic.The direction was not that much good.Thescreenplay was OK.The plot was good.The songs were bad.The locationswere OK.The cinematography was OK.The acting from Irfan khan was reallygood and because of that man I have rated this movie 6.He really actsvery well and gets into the character of every roles he plays in hisevery films.So guys its really a worth timepassing.If you want to gothen go this otherwise......
