This is cheesy and a straight-shooting plot line. It's an easy watch,enjoyable movie, but don't expect much substance. The acting and scriptare a little cringy, but it fits the tone of the movie to a tee. Youwon't remember it, and you won't recommend it but if you enjoy filmslike the princess diaries or Hallmark movies then this one's for you.
